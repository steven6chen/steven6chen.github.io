Acute RRTs include intermittent hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRTs), and hybrid therapies such as prolonged intermittent renal replacement therapies (PIRRTs).</p><p>CRRT is widely used for acute RRT in the intensive care units (ICUs) in developed nations.</p><p>This topic provides recommendations for the prescription of CRRT. Anticoagulation and medication dosing are discussed elsewhere.

The provision of CRRT should be coordinated among multiple disciplines including critical care medicine, nephrology, nursing, pharmacy, and nutrition support teams [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescription-of-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>We believe that institutions should adhere to a written protocol developed by a panel of multidisciplinary experts within the institution. The protocol should address the key components of the CRRT prescription including vascular access, anticoagulation, CRRT mode, dose, and CRRT solutions. Making programmatic decisions regarding these components will foster consistency and improve quality.</p><p>While there is a nearly limitless combination of modes (convection, diffusion, both), machines, circuits, effluent flow rates, fluid removal strategies, and vascular access devices, having multiple individual approaches between CRRT prescribers leads to wide variability in practice and increases the possibility for errors in medication dosing, anticoagulation strategy, machine set-up, and nursing operations.</p><p>Furthermore, ideally, institutions are encouraged to develop and monitor CRRT quality indicators that track outcomes such as CRRT circuit survival duration, small-solute clearance, bleeding events, interruptions to treatment and downtime (ie, time during which CRRT is not being delivered to the patient), catheter dysfunction, fluid management, and patient mortality. However, there are no data that such a tracking program improves outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4039288391\"><span class=\"h1\">VASCULAR ACCESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A well-functioning vascular access is critical to maintaining CRRT circuit function since CRRT will not work adequately with a suboptimal access. (See <a href=\"#H1677459194\" class=\"local\">'CRRT blood flow rate'</a> below.)</p><p>The preferred insertion site, proper catheter size, configuration, length, and depth and proper technique for placement are addressed in depth elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-catheters-for-acute-and-chronic-hemodialysis-access\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central catheters for acute and chronic hemodialysis access&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some clinicians use specialized triple-lumen dialysis catheters for CRRT, although this is not our preferred option for most patients. Although triple-lumen catheters may be effective in some patients, the third lumen decreases the internal diameter of the two dialysis lumens, which could limit blood flows.</p><p>If a triple-lumen catheter is used, the third lumen should not be used for lifesaving medications (such as antimicrobials) while CRRT is ongoing. The third lumen should only be used for medications without CRRT-related clearance (ie, intravenous crystalloid or colloid boluses or infusions, systemic heparin infusion, blood product administration, etc). It is theoretically possible that medications infused via the third lumen may be more rapidly cleared by dialysis than if the medication was administered via a different access. However, there are no published data on the magnitude of first-pass clearance resulting from recirculation between the medication infusion lumen and the dialysis outflow lumen.</p><p>We also do not use the third lumen to infuse calcium in patients receiving citrate anticoagulation, as, in our experience, this has been associated with recirculation and inaccurate calcium values. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anticoagulation-for-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy#H2471169903\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anticoagulation for continuous renal replacement therapy&quot;, section on 'Regional citrate anticoagulation'</a>.)</p><p>For patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), we do not use the arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or arteriovenous graft (AVG) unless no other access is possible, although there have been published data in such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescription-of-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. There is a potential risk of vascular damage to the access with rigid needles, and needle dislodgement could cause blood loss, especially with required patient repositioning in the intensive care unit (ICU). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=continuous-renal-replacement-therapy-in-acute-kidney-injury#H2066372669\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Continuous renal replacement therapy in acute kidney injury&quot;, section on 'Vascular access'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H644552932\"><span class=\"h1\">HEMOFILTER</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hemofilter (also referred to as hemodialyzer) is the same device for all CRRT modalities. High-permeability, high-flux biocompatible membranes are used for all modalities of CRRT. The typical membrane materials used are&nbsp;polyacrylonitrile (AN69),&nbsp;polyarylethersulfone (PAES), and&nbsp;polyethersulfone (PES). There are no data suggesting that one type of membrane is better.</p><p>Theoretically, because of their negative charge, polyacrylonitrile membranes may allow more adsorption and removal of middle-molecular-weight solutes, such as cytokines. However, no difference in outcomes has been demonstrated.</p><p>The polyacrylonitrile membranes can cause bradykinin release. An untreated AN69 membrane should not be used with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, as this has been reported to cause anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescription-of-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biochemical-mechanisms-involved-in-blood-hemodialysis-membrane-interactions#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biochemical mechanisms involved in blood-hemodialysis membrane interactions&quot;, section on 'Blood-membrane interactions'</a>). However, AN69 surface-treated (ST) membranes can be used safely with these medications. The AN69 ST membrane is coated with a polycationic saline solution (PEI), which reduces the surface electronegativity and avoids bradykinin generation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescription-of-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

CVVH utilizes convection, whereas CVVHD utilizes diffusion. CVVHDF uses a combination of both convection and diffusion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=continuous-renal-replacement-therapy-in-acute-kidney-injury#H3419961088\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Continuous renal replacement therapy in acute kidney injury&quot;, section on 'Definition of CRRT modality'</a>.)</p><p>We use CVVHD or CVVHDF rather than CVVH because diffusive therapies are able to deliver a higher RRT dose without driving up the filtration fraction to unacceptably high values. When blood flow, hematocrit, and total effluent flow rates are held constant, purely convective modes of therapy (such as CVVH) always have a higher filtration fraction compared with diffusive therapies.</p><p>The filtration fraction is the fraction of plasma water that is removed from blood during ultrafiltration.&nbsp;High filtration fractions are associated with increased circuit clotting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescription-of-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3106667164\" class=\"local\">'Filtration fraction'</a> below.)</p><p>However, many centers use CVVH, and the modality is often selected based on the CRRT device availability at a given institution. There are no studies that suggest better clinical outcomes with a specific modality. In a meta-analysis of 19 randomized, controlled trials that compared hemofiltration with hemodialysis for patients with acute kidney injury (including 16 studies of continuous therapies), there was no difference in survival, dialysis dependence, organ dysfunction, or vasopressor use among survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescription-of-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

The effluent is the waste fluid that comes out of the outflow port of the <span class=\"nowrap\">dialysate/ultrafiltrate</span> compartment of the hemofilter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescription-of-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. For patients on CVVH, the effluent consists of ultrafiltration volume. For patients on CVVHD, the effluent consists of ultrafiltration volume plus spent dialysate.</p><p>We prescribe an effluent flow rate of approximately 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/hour</span> in order to achieve (despite interruptions and CRRT downtime, which are inevitable) a minimum effluent rate of 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/hour</span> over a 24-hour period. Exceptions are patients with severe metabolic derangements (such as hyperkalemia or acidemia) that require more urgent correction over 24 to 36 hours. For such patients we start with a higher CRRT dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescription-of-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. For example, among some patients with severe metabolic acidemia (pH &lt;7.1), we start with an effluent flow rate &gt;40 to 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/hour</span> until acidosis is partially corrected.</p><p>Once the severe metabolic derangements are improved, we decrease the prescribed CRRT dose to approximately 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/hour</span>. This is consistent with the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescription-of-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Large clinical trials have not shown a benefit of higher CRRT dose (&gt;35 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/hour)</span> compared with standard CRRT dose (20 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/hour)</span> when applied over the entire duration of a patient's CRRT course (ie, days to weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescription-of-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. In addition, higher doses of CRRT, particularly if prolonged, may lead to protein malnutrition, severe deficiency of many vitamins and micronutrients, and inadequate antimicrobial drug levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescription-of-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>Among patients who start with a higher CRRT dose, it is difficult to define an exact threshold of laboratory abnormalities at which the CRRT dose may be decreased. Usually, the decision to reduce dose depends on stability or improvement of laboratory values (ie, the potassium remains stable and within normal parameters; pH and bicarbonate are normal or near normal and blood urea nitrogen is steadily declining).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3106667164\"><span class=\"h2\">Filtration fraction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The filtration fraction is the proportion of plasma water entering the dialyzer that is moved by ultrafiltration across the dialysis membrane or, as defined above, the fraction of water that is removed from blood.&nbsp;We maintain a filtration fraction &lt;20 percent. Higher fractions are associated with increased circuit clotting, presumably from hemoconcentration and blood protein-membrane interactions within the hemofilter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prescription-of-continuous-renal-replacement-therapy-in-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Filtration fraction (FF) is arithmetically defined as follows:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>FF = [ultrafiltration flow rate <span class=\"nowrap\">/</span> [plasma water flow rate]</p></div></div><p>The ultrafiltration flow rate is the rate at which plasma water is transferred across the&nbsp;membrane driven by a pressure gradient between blood and <span class=\"nowrap\">dialysate/ultrafiltrate</span> compartments.</p><p>The total ultrafiltration volume is the overall ultrafiltration volume produced during treatment and is the sum of the replacement fluid volume and net ultrafiltration volume removed from the patient by the machine. For most CRRT machines, the total ultrafiltration rate is defined as the sum of the replacement fluid rate and fluid removal rate.&nbsp;This definition of ultrafiltration rate is different from that used in intermittent hemodialysis, where it refers to the net ultrafiltration rate (ie, rate at which fluid is removed from the body).</p><p>The plasma water flow rate is the rate at which plasma water is delivered to the dialyzer or hemofilter. It is equal to:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>The blood flow rate x (1-hematocrit) + the prefilter replacement fluid flow rate + any other prepump infusion rate (such as citrate)</p></div></div><p>A relatively low filtration fraction can be maintained by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keeping the ultrafiltration flow rate low</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increasing blood flow rate (which determines plasma water flow rate), providing catheter function can support higher flows</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using prefilter replacement fluid in CVVH or CVVHDF</p><p/><p>Keeping the ultrafiltration rate low may require the addition of a diffusive component of clearance, especially when a relatively high effluent flow rate (ie, &gt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/hour)</span> is required based on patients' weights or clinical needs (see <a href=\"#H3985630269\" class=\"local\">'CRRT modality'</a> above). In pure convective therapies, such as CVVH, solute movement across the membrane is dependent upon the same force that drives ultrafiltration (ie, transmembrane pressure). In order to maintain adequate solute movement, transmembrane pressure and, thus, ultrafiltration must be relatively high. In diffusive therapies, solute movement is largely independent of the ultrafiltration rate since it is driven by diffusion and not transmembrane pressure. The ultrafiltration rate may be kept relatively low and still maintain solute movement.</p><p>Since CVVHDF uses a combination of diffusion and convection, the filtration fraction lies between CVVH and CVVHD, depending on the relative contribution of convection and diffusion to the total effluent flow rate. In general, for a fixed effluent rate, the filtration fraction with CVVHDF is less than that with CVVH since a portion of the dose is provided by diffusive therapy.</p><p>The use of prefilter replacement fluid in CVVH or CVVHDF will help to maintain a low filtration fraction since it increases the plasma water flow rate, at least compared with postfilter replacement fluid. However, this is usually not sufficient to prevent hemoconcentration and clotting of the hemofilter. Prefilter replacement may decrease small-solute clearance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1677459194\"><span class=\"h2\">CRRT blood flow rate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who are on anticoagulation, we try to maintain a blood flow rate of 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>. A higher blood flow rate (200 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span> is required if anticoagulation is not used in order to maintain catheter patency and CRRT circuit life.</p><p>Low blood flow rates (&lt;100 to 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span> can increase hemofilter and circuit failures due to stasis of blood and an increased filtration fraction since the filtration fraction is inversely proportional to the blood flow.</p><p>A change in the blood flow rate between 100 and 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> usually does not affect solute clearance. Solute clearance can be limited by either the blood flow rate or the effluent flow rate. Since the blood flow rate is almost always much greater than effluent flow rate, solute clearance is usually effluent flow rate limited. The exception is when the effluent flow rate is greater or equal to blood flow rate.</p><p>The blood flow rate does not affect hemodynamic stability, since the volume of blood in the circuit at any one time does not change as blood flow rate changes.</p><p>Higher blood flow rates than 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> may decrease the circuit lifespan. Per manufacturer guidelines, CRRT hemofilter life is limited both by time and by the volume of blood processed. The maximum volume of blood processed is attained sooner with higher blood flow rates. Higher blood flow rates may also result in increased pressure alarms, resulting in pump stoppage and blood stasis, which increases the risk of clotting.</p><p>Among patients who are anticoagulated with RCA, faster blood flows also increase the amount of required citrate. This increases cost (as one has to purchase more citrate) and the risk of complications as more citrate will return to the patient's systemic circulation.

For patients on CVVHDF, a 2 mEq K solution may be generated on the CRRT device by using both a 4 K solution and 0 K solution delivered at the same rate.

For many of these components, programmatic or institutional decisions will foster consistency and improve quality. (See <a href=\"#H1814912615\" class=\"local\">'Implementation of CRRT program'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A well-functioning vascular access is important to maintaining CRRT circuit function. We generally do not use triple-lumen dialysis catheters for CRRT, since the third lumen may decrease the internal diameter of the two dialysis lumens, limiting blood flows. If a triple-lumen catheter is used, the third lumen should not be used for lifesaving medications (such as antimicrobials) while CRRT is ongoing. Among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), we also do not use the arteriovenous (AV) access unless no other access is possible. (See <a href=\"#H4039288391\" class=\"local\">'Vascular access'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CRRT modalities are distinguished by their underlying mechanism of solute removal (ie, convection versus diffusion). The specific CRRT modality should be selected based on the CRRT device availability and expertise at a given institution. We generally use diffusive therapies, particularly for larger patients who require a higher dose of CRRT. Diffusive therapies are more likely to provide an adequate dialysis dose (which is weight based) while maintaining the filtration fraction within an acceptable limit. (See <a href=\"#H3985630269\" class=\"local\">'CRRT modality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Filtration fraction is defined as the ratio of ultrafiltration flow rate to plasma water flow rate. We maintain a filtration fraction &lt;20 to 25 percent. Higher filtration fractions may increase the risk of circuit clotting, presumably from hemoconcentration and blood protein-membrane interactions. (See <a href=\"#H3106667164\" class=\"local\">'Filtration fraction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who are on anticoagulation, we try to maintain a blood flow rate of 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>. A higher blood flow rate (200 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span> is required if anticoagulation is not used in order to maintain catheter patency and CRRT circuit life. (See <a href=\"#H1677459194\" class=\"local\">'CRRT blood flow rate'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The CRRT dose is expressed as effluent flow rate. We usually target an effluent flow rate of 25 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> in order to achieve a delivered flow rate of 20 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>. A benefit has not been shown with higher CRRT doses. An exception is among patients with severe electrolyte or acid-base disturbances who may require a higher dose, at least initially. (See <a href=\"#H1992826777\" class=\"local\">'CRRT dose'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Numerous commercially prepared CRRT solutions are available. We do not customize the CRRT solutions, due to the risk of error in compounding. The solution is selected based on laboratory values, which are checked frequently (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F116010\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116010 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H960615770\" class=\"local\">'CRRT solutions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3051028983\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We target an hourly fluid balance ranging from net even to net negative 200 to 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> as the clinical condition dictates, yielding a 24-hour fluid balance of even to negative 4 to 6 L. The net fluid removal may need to be decreased if there are signs of intolerance (ie, decreasing cardiac output, concerning increase in vasopressor needs, etc).
