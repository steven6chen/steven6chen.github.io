The infection originates most often from an obstructed anal crypt gland, with the resultant pus collecting in the subcutaneous tissue, intersphincteric plane, or beyond (ischiorectal space or supralevator space) where various types of anorectal abscesses form. Once diagnosed, anorectal abscesses should be promptly drained surgically. An undrained anorectal abscess can continue to expand into adjacent spaces as well as progress to generalized systemic infection. </p><p>Anorectal abscesses and fistulas can be thought of as two sequential phases of the same anorectal infectious process: an abscess represents the acute phase of infection, while a fistula represents the chronic phase of suppuration and fistulization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perianal-and-perirectal-abscess/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Thus, it is not surprising that 30 to 70 percent of anorectal abscesses are associated with a concomitant anorectal fistula and that 30 to 40 percent of patients develop an anorectal fistula after undergoing treatment for an anorectal abscess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perianal-and-perirectal-abscess/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. </p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of anorectal abscess are discussed in this topic. Anorectal fistulas are reviewed in other topics.

The incidence is likely an underestimate as many patients with anorectal symptoms prefer attributing them to &quot;hemorrhoids&quot; to seeking medical attention for an accurate diagnosis.</p><p>The mean age of presentation is 40 years (range 20 to 60) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perianal-and-perirectal-abscess/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. Adult males are twice as likely to develop an anorectal abscess <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fistula compared with females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perianal-and-perirectal-abscess/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H169001136\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anorectal abscess typically originates from an infected anal crypt gland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perianal-and-perirectal-abscess/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. There are 8 to 10 anal crypt glands arranged circumferentially within the anal canal at the level of the dentate line (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F72874\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72874 \">figure 1</a>). The glands penetrate the internal sphincter and end in the intersphincteric plane. An abscess develops when an anal crypt gland becomes obstructed with inspissated debris, which permits bacterial growth and abscess formation. Some abscesses traverse distally in the intersphincteric groove into the perianal skin, where they present as a tender, fluctuant mass (perianal abscess). Others follow the path of least resistance to other spaces (intersphincteric, ischiorectal, supralevator) to form perirectal abscesses. </p><p>Approximately one-half of anorectal abscesses will result in the development of a chronic fistula that connects the inciting anal gland with the skin overlying the drainage site. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anorectal-fistula-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-principles\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anorectal fistula: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management principles&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2829470148\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A perianal abscess is a simple anorectal abscess. Perirectal abscesses are more complex and can involve different planes in the anorectum, have distinct clinical presentations, and require more nuanced management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perianal-and-perirectal-abscess/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The classification of perirectal abscesses is based on their anatomic locations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F63704\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63704 \">figure 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ischiorectal abscess (ischioanal abscess)</strong> &minus; Ischiorectal abscesses, also referred to as ischioanal abscesses, penetrate through the external anal sphincter into the ischiorectal space (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F63229\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63229 \">figure 3</a>) and present as a diffuse, tender, indurated, and fluctuant area within the buttocks. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intersphincteric abscess</strong> &minus; Intersphincteric abscesses account for only 2 to 5 percent of all anorectal abscesses. They are located in the intersphincteric groove between the internal and external sphincters. As a result, they often do not cause perianal skin changes but can be palpated during digital rectal examination as a fluctuant mass protruding into the lumen. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Supralevator abscess</strong> &minus; Supralevator abscesses can originate from two different sources: the typical cryptoglandular infection that travels superiorly within the intersphincteric plane to the supralevator space, or an inflammatory pelvic process caused by Crohn disease or perforated colon from diverticular disease or cancer. The potential source of pelvic infection is best determined from patient history.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with a supralevator abscess present with severe perianal pain, fever, and sometimes urinary retention. Physical examination usually reveals no obvious external findings. On digital examination, an area of induration or fluctuation can often be felt above the level of the anorectal ring. Due to the paucity of physical findings, imaging studies such as computed tomography may be required to establish the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-role-of-imaging-tests-in-the-evaluation-of-anal-abscesses-and-fistulas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The role of imaging tests in the evaluation of anal abscesses and fistulas&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Horseshoe abscess</strong> &mdash; A horseshoe abscess is a complex perirectal abscess that most often forms posterior to the anal canal. The potential space where the abscess originates is bound by the pelvic floor superiorly, by the anococcygeal ligament inferiorly, and by the coccyx and anal canal. Because of these relatively rigid boundaries, abscesses in this space are forced to extend into the ischiorectal space, either unilaterally or bilaterally (horseshoe). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas#H22288895\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Operative management of anorectal fistulas&quot;, section on 'Modified Hanley procedure'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H620962517\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with an anorectal abscess often present with severe pain in the anal or rectal area. The pain is constant and not necessarily associated with a bowel movement. Constitutional symptoms such as fever and malaise are common. Purulent rectal drainage may be noted if the abscess has begun to drain spontaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perianal-and-perirectal-abscess/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>On physical examination, an area of fluctuance or a patch of erythematous, indurated skin overlying the perianal skin may be noted in patients with a superficial (eg, perianal) abscess (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F67524\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67524 \">picture 1</a>). Patients with a deeper (eg, supralevator) abscess, however, may not have any physical findings on external examination, and the abscess can only be felt via digital rectal examination or by imaging. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H307677847\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anorectal abscess should be suspected in patients who present with severe pain in the anal or rectal area. A superficial anorectal abscess can be diagnosed on physical examination with findings of perianal erythema and a palpable, often fluctuant mass. A deeper abscess can be diagnosed by feeling a tender, often fluctuant mass internally on digital rectal exam or by imaging studies. (See <a href=\"#H2131734987\" class=\"local\">'Imaging studies'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2131734987\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imaging studies, such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and transperitoneal or endorectal ultrasound, can confirm the diagnosis when a deep anorectal abscess is suspected but cannot be palpated by external examination or digital rectal examination.

These conditions include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anal fissure</strong> &ndash; An anal fissure is a tear in the anoderm distal to the dentate line. Most anal fissures occur at the posterior midline position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F51583\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51583 \">picture 2</a>). A tear in the anoderm is absent in perianal abscess. Patients with an acute anal fissure present with tearing pain accompanying the passage of bowel movements, while the pain associated with a perianal abscess is constant and unrelated to bowel movements.

Anorectal abscesses can present with a concomitant anal fistula. Chronic fistulas are characterized by chronic purulent drainage and a pustule-like lesion in the perianal or buttock area (external opening) that can be indurated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F56209\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56209 \">picture 3</a>). Patients with an anal fistula experience intermittent, rather than constant, rectal pain as well as intermittent and malodorous perianal drainage and pruritus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perianal-and-perirectal-abscess/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Although both present with anorectal pain, thrombosed external hemorrhoid can be distinguished from perianal abscess by the presence of a thrombosed perianal lump (external hemorrhoid) at the anal verge (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F72916\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72916 \">picture 4</a>).

Internal hemorrhoids can be palpated on digital rectal examination as fluctuant masses. Although prolapsed internal hemorrhoids can also cause anorectal pain, they can usually be recognized as vascular structures (hemorrhoids), rather than abscesses.

Compared with a perianal abscess, a skin abscess is more discreet and superficial, less painful, and less likely to cause systemic symptoms (eg, fever).

Perianal hidradenitis can become infected with purulent drainage. However, hidradenitis usually presents with characteristic skin changes such as inflammatory nodules, sinus tracts, comedones, and scarring that are absent with perianal abscesses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65188\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65188 \">picture 8</a>).

Once diagnosed, all perianal and perirectal abscesses should be drained promptly; lack of fluctuance should not be a reason to delay treatment. Any undrained anorectal abscess can continue to expand into adjacent spaces as well as progress to generalized systemic infection. </p><p>All incision and drainage procedures for anorectal abscesses follow the same general principles but may vary by surgical approaches (through a skin incision or into the rectum) depending on anatomical considerations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perianal-and-perirectal-abscess/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H941876022\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical principles</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4206339794\"><span class=\"h3\">Incision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All skin incisions should be made as close to the anal verge as possible to minimize the length of a potential fistula while still providing adequate drainage of the abscess. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H522747101\"><span class=\"h3\">Wound packing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wound packing is commonly performed after incision and drainage of anorectal abscesses but has no proven benefit according to data from randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perianal-and-perirectal-abscess/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. In two small trials, not packing the wound after draining anorectal abscesses resulted in similar rates of recurrence and fistula formation and similar healing time but less postoperative pain compared with packing the wound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perianal-and-perirectal-abscess/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H962845634\"><span class=\"h3\">Concomitant fistulotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thirty to 70 percent of patients with anorectal abscess present with a concomitant anal fistula. In those patients, whether or not to perform abscess drainage with a primary fistulotomy is controversial. We suggest that a fistulotomy may be performed with caution for simple anal fistulas or when the risk of a recurrence is high (eg, horseshoe abscess). For other patients, it is best to stage the fistulotomy as a secondary procedure after the inflammation and edema subside. </p><p>A concomitant fistulotomy performed with the drainage of an anorectal abscess has been studied in multiple trials with conflicting results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perianal-and-perirectal-abscess/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. A 2010 Cochrane review of six trials, which included 479 patients, concluded that sphincter division (fistulotomy or fistulectomy) performed with a drainage procedure decreased the rates of persistent <span class=\"nowrap\">fistula/abscess,</span> abscess recurrence, and subsequent surgery (relative risk 0.13, 95% CI 0.07-0.24) but increased the rate of incontinence (relative risk 3.06, 95% CI 0.7-13.45) at one-year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perianal-and-perirectal-abscess/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Thus, the decision to perform a concomitant fistulotomy versus a delayed one should be made after weighing the benefits (healing) against the risks (incontinence) for each patient. The local condition for performing a delayed fistulotomy is generally more favorable once the edema and inflammation have subsided.

The incision for the drainage site should be placed as close to the sphincter complex as possible to minimize the length of a potential future fistula tract. The abscess cavity is irrigated with sterile saline and the wound is dressed; no wound packing is necessary.

A mucosal incision is made below the dentate line, and the internal sphincter muscle is divided up to the dentate line. The abscess cavity is then deroofed. Following that, the cut edge of the mucosa and internal sphincter muscle may be sutured (marsupialized) for hemostasis. The abscess cavity is kept open to drain. No packing or catheter is required. Patients should perform regular warm sitz baths to keep the wound clean. Healing is expected in three to four weeks without any additional procedure. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88523154\"><span class=\"h4\">Supralevator</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Supralevator abscesses can be drained in one of two ways depending upon the origin of the abscess: abscesses that form as an upward extension of an ischiorectal abscess should be drained through a skin incision (see <a href=\"#H88523140\" class=\"local\">'Ischiorectal'</a> above). Abscesses originating from a pelvic process or as an upward extension of an intersphincteric abscess should be drained into the rectum through an incision in the rectal wall or through a transanal drain to avoid creating an extrasphincteric fistula. (See <a href=\"#H88523147\" class=\"local\">'Intersphincteric'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88523161\"><span class=\"h4\">Horseshoe</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most horseshoe abscesses originate from the deep posterior anal space deep to the external sphincter and inferior to the levator ani muscle, before progressing into unilateral or bilateral ischiorectal spaces. (See <a href=\"#H2829470148\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p>The key to treating horseshoe abscesses is to adequately drain the deep posterior anal space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/perianal-and-perirectal-abscess/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. For patients with an isolated deep postanal space abscess, one can make a posterior incision between the coccyx and the anus, but posterior incisions are difficult to heal. A radial incision slightly off midline is the better alternative. A radial incision should be made midway between the anus and the coccyx. Dissection is carried through the subcutaneous tissue, and the anococcygeal ligament is divided at the posterior midline to drain the posterior anal infection. </p><p>Most patients do not present with an isolated deep postanal space infection but with a unilateral (more common) or bilateral (rare) horseshoe abscess. Counter incisions can then be made on one or both sides to drain any extension of infection to the ischiorectal spaces from the postanal space. A draining seton can be placed, but often the fistula tract is difficult to identify because most patients present with the ischiorectal space inflamed <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> infected. </p><p>If a fistula is present, a seton can be placed. Performing a concomitant fistulotomy may decrease the risk of disease recurrence but increase risk of incontinence and therefore may not be suitable for all patients. Concomitant fistulotomy should also be done with extreme caution since it may lead to incontinence. The tissue is often inflamed and the anatomy distorted. We typically place a draining seton and treat the fistula at a second surgery. (See <a href=\"#H962845634\" class=\"local\">'Concomitant fistulotomy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=operative-management-of-anorectal-fistulas#H22288895\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Operative management of anorectal fistulas&quot;, section on 'Modified Hanley procedure'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

A superficial anorectal abscess can be diagnosed on physical examination with findings of perianal erythema and a palpable, often fluctuant mass (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F67524\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67524 \">picture 1</a>). A deeper abscess can only be diagnosed by feeling a tender, often fluctuant mass internally on digital rectal exam, or by imaging studies, such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or ultrasound of the pelvis. (See <a href=\"#H620962517\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H307677847\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary treatment of anorectal abscess is surgical drainage. Once diagnosed, all perianal and perirectal abscesses should be drained promptly; lack of fluctuance should not be a reason to delay treatment. Any undrained anorectal abscess can continue to expand into adjacent spaces as well as progress to generalized systemic infection. (See <a href=\"#H88522975\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All skin incisions should be made as close to the anal verge as possible to minimize the length of a potential fistula while still providing adequate drainage of the abscess. Wound packing has <strong>no</strong> proven benefit. (See <a href=\"#H4206339794\" class=\"local\">'Incision'</a> above and <a href=\"#H522747101\" class=\"local\">'Wound packing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a concomitant fistula, a fistulotomy may be performed with caution if the fistula is simple or when the risk of recurrence is high (eg, horseshoe abscess). For other patients, it is best to stage the fistulotomy as a secondary procedure after the inflammation and edema subside. (See <a href=\"#H962845634\" class=\"local\">'Concomitant fistulotomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After drainage of an anorectal abscess, we prescribe antibiotics (either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-and-clavulanate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin-clavulanate</a> or a combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a>) to patients with extensive <span class=\"nowrap\">perianal/perineal</span> cellulitis, systemic infection, valvular heart disease, diabetes, or immunosuppression. Routine antibiotic therapy in patients with no risk factors is controversial and decided by surgeon preference. (See <a href=\"#H2962911242\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients who undergo drainage of an anorectal abscess, routine wound culture is <strong>not</strong> necessary. Wound cultures may be obtained if the result will impact treatment (eg, choice of antibiotics) or when the patient (eg, immunosuppression) is at high risk of harboring resistant or unusual organisms (eg, methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> [MRSA]). (See <a href=\"#H1419440546\" class=\"local\">'Wound culture'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A perianal abscess should be drained through a skin incision.
