B. burgdorferi is the principal cause of the disease in the United States. All three pathogenic species occur in Europe, and two (B. afzelii and B. garinii) have been identified in Asia. Lyme disease has a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations and severity, thought to be due, in part, to differences in the infecting species.</p><p>The neurologic manifestations of Lyme disease will be reviewed here. Other aspects of Lyme disease are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-lyme-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Lyme disease in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lyme-disease-clinical-manifestations-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lyme disease: Clinical manifestations in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-lyme-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of Lyme disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-lyme-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of Lyme disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10939440\"><span class=\"h1\">BACKGROUND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Borrelia burgdorferi, the organism responsible for the multisystem infectious disease known as Lyme disease, appears to preferentially affect several organ systems. Skin, the site of inoculation, is involved in 80 percent or more of infected individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Joint involvement occurs frequently in patients in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], but less commonly in Europe. The third most common site is the nervous system, which is involved in 10 to 15 percent of infected individuals in both Europe and the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-lyme-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Lyme disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Just as in neurosyphilis, nervous system involvement begins during early disseminated Lyme disease, when spread of the spirochetes can result in meningeal seeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. As in syphilis, untreated Borrelia infection probably subsides in some patients but becomes chronic in others. Also as in syphilis, appropriate antimicrobial treatment results in microbiologic cure in the overwhelming majority of patients, regardless of the duration of the infection.</p><p>Much of the confusion and controversy surrounding Lyme disease relates to misunderstandings about what does and does not constitute evidence of nervous system infection. Many patients with Lyme disease develop nonspecific symptoms, including headache, fatigue, cognitive slowing, and memory difficulty. However, these symptoms are not indicative of central nervous system infection and, moreover, are common in many other infectious and inflammatory states [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. At any point in time, indistinguishable cognitive symptoms occur in as many as 2 percent of otherwise healthy people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], in whom they can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life.</p><p>Emphasis on these nonspecific symptoms in early studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>] led some to the erroneous conclusion that such symptoms had a degree of specificity for Lyme disease. This misunderstanding was one of the elements that contributed to misconceptions about which individuals required treatment for Lyme disease, what constituted effective treatment, and how to define cure.</p><p>An accurate understanding of nervous system Lyme disease is best addressed by considering the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The true scope of nervous system disorders attributable to Lyme disease and the pathophysiologic mechanisms of each</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Available diagnostic tools</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Appropriate treatment</p><p/><p>Two often repeated assertions are more misleading than helpful: first, that the diagnosis of Lyme disease is primarily a clinical diagnosis and second, that Lyme disease can mimic many other diseases. Both are particularly problematic when it comes to nervous system disease, since many clinicians have difficulty differentiating between true nervous system disorders and the effects of extra-neurologic disease on behavior and cognitive function. This difficulty is compounded by phenomenology-based assertions that &quot;Lyme disease can do anything&quot; in the nervous system. Such statements represent a failure to recognize the common pathophysiologic threads that unify the disparate clinical phenomena seen in this disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10939447\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lymphocytic meningitis, cranial neuropathy (particularly facial nerve palsy), and radiculoneuritis (motor or sensory or both) constitute the classic triad of acute, early neurologic Lyme disease. These manifestations may occur alone or in combination, but radiculoneuritis is diagnosed less commonly than meningitis or facial palsy.</p><p>Lyme disease is often described, by analogy to syphilis, as having three stages: early (or acute) localized disease (erythema migrans), early disseminated disease, and late disseminated disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F72018\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72018 \">table 1</a>). Since arbitrary stages convey little information, and since the separation between early and late disease is less clear cut than in syphilis, we prefer to use descriptive terminology to discuss nervous system Lyme disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-lyme-disease-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Lyme disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical stages'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lyme-disease-clinical-manifestations-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lyme disease: Clinical manifestations in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>By definition, nervous system involvement only occurs in disseminated Lyme disease. Specific syndromes tend to be divided into those with fairly abrupt onset and dramatic presentations (eg, meningitis, facial nerve palsy, radiculoneuritis, focal encephalitis) and those with more indolent onset and protracted courses (eg, later polyneuropathies). Acute neurologic involvement usually occurs weeks to several months after the tick bite and may be the first manifestation of Lyme disease. It is distinctly unusual for acute facial nerve palsy or meningitis to occur many months or years after the initial infection. In contrast, certain neurologic problems, such as a more indolent, disseminated polyneuropathy, may rarely develop months to a few years after the initial infection.</p><p>It is unknown whether the time course of these syndromes is related to differences in spirochetal strain, inoculum size, or host response. However, the syndromes associated with abrupt onset typically occur early in infection (within the first few months), whereas those that are more indolent and protracted often present later in the course (eg, many months after initial infection).</p><p>Nervous system Lyme disease can be divided conceptually into disorders of the peripheral versus central nervous systems. In both, the predominant mechanism appears to be multifocal inflammatory involvement of the affected structure, be it patchy peripheral nerve involvement or, rarely, patchy inflammation of the central nervous system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10939454\"><span class=\"h2\">Peripheral nervous system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Peripheral nerve disorders in general can be broadly subdivided into those due to axon damage, those caused by abnormalities of myelin, and those related to multifocal damage (the last of which is typically due to a vasculopathic process such as vasculitis or diabetes). Detailed studies in patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] and in experimentally infected rhesus macaque monkeys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] indicate that peripheral nerve involvement in Lyme disease primarily consists of a multifocal axonal process. Although pathologic studies indicate a role for inflammation, and treatment responsiveness indicates an essential role for active infection, the pathophysiology is not well understood. Spirochetes cannot be demonstrated in peripheral nerve, although small numbers have been identified in dorsal root ganglia of experimentally infected monkeys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A possible role of immunologic cross reactivity has been suggested but seems inconsistent with the rapid response to antimicrobial therapy.</p><p>In early disease, two peripheral nerve manifestations are particularly common (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F77485\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77485 \">table 2</a>) and form part of the classic triad of meningitis, cranial neuritis, and radiculoneuritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Both radiculoneuritis and cranial neuropathy often, but not invariably, occur in conjunction with lymphocytic meningitis. In other bacterial meningitides, such cranial nerve and spinal root involvement occurs due to damage as these structures pass through the infected, inflamed subarachnoid space. In contrast, this does <strong>not</strong> appear to be the mechanism in Lyme disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10939461\"><span class=\"h3\">Cranial neuropathies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cranial neuropathies associated with Lyme disease tend to occur early in infection and are usually abrupt in onset. Virtually any cranial nerve can be involved, but the seventh (facial) is by far the most common, occurring in 8 percent of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed cases of Lyme disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Most patients have quite elevated concentrations of anti-B. burgdorferi antibody in their peripheral blood, often with a prominent IgM component. Occasionally the cranial neuropathy occurs before the patient has become seropositive; in such patients, a follow-up titer in several weeks is typically diagnostic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-lyme-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of Lyme disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Since idiopathic facial nerve palsy is uncommon in young children, Lyme disease should be strongly considered as the cause of facial nerve palsy affecting a child who has been in an endemic area. In adults in endemic areas, during spring through fall, a significant percentage of facial nerve palsies are attributable to Lyme disease. In one study in an endemic region, one quarter of cases of facial nerve palsy in the summer were likely due to Lyme disease, based upon serologies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Involvement can be bilateral, with onset being either simultaneous or in rapid succession. Because bilateral facial nerve palsies are generally uncommon, such cases should bring Lyme disease to mind in patients with potential recent exposure. The differential diagnosis of bilateral facial nerve palsies is limited and includes Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome, sarcoidosis, HIV infection, and other basilar meningitides.</p><p>Although facial nerve involvement represents about 80 percent of all Lyme disease-associated cranial neuropathies, other nerves can be affected. Involvement of the nerves innervating the extraocular muscles, the vestibulocochlear nerve, occasionally the trigeminal nerve, and infrequently the lower cranial nerves has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Papilledema (swelling of the optic nerve head due to transmitted raised intracranial pressure) and papillitis (inflammation of the optic nerve head) have been well described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Retrospective data suggest that optic neuritis (inflammation of the second cranial nerve, which is actually part of the central nervous system) occurs rarely, if ever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10939468\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiculoneuritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The other common peripheral nerve manifestation of Lyme disease, and probably the most commonly missed diagnosis, is Lyme radiculoneuritis, which is reported in 3 percent of CDC verified cases of Lyme disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Pain is often a prominent element. This disorder can mimic a mechanical radiculopathy (eg, sciatica) with radicular pain in one or several dermatomes, accompanied by corresponding sensory, motor, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> reflex changes. Lyme radiculoneuritis should be considered in patients in endemic areas presenting in spring through autumn with severe limb or truncal radicular pain without an apparent mechanical precipitant.</p><p>Historically, the European literature had suggested that involvement occurred in dermatomes related to the site of the tick bite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>], although a thorough subsequent study called this into doubt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]; the issue has not been addressed systematically in the United States.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30180706\"><span class=\"h3\">Bannwarth syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In European neuroborreliosis, the term Garin-Bujadoux-Bannwarth syndrome (or Bannwarth syndrome) has been applied to the constellation of painful radiculoneuritis (the hallmark of the syndrome) with variable motor weakness, sometimes accompanied by facial nerve palsy and a cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/24,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26,27</a>]. Although this syndrome occurs in the United States, it is probably under-diagnosed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10939475\"><span class=\"h3\">Other forms of peripheral nerve involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although less common than cranial neuropathy and radiculoneuritis, other types of peripheral nerve involvement may occur with Lyme disease, and probably represent variant forms of mononeuropathy multiplex. Early in infection, these include acute disorders such as brachial and lumbosacral plexopathies and mononeuropathies. Later in untreated infection, patients occasionally may develop what is referred to as a confluent mononeuropathy multiplex. This type of disorder causes a clinical picture simulating a distal polyneuropathy and appears to reflect involvement of multiple small nerve branches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/12,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,28</a>]. Although rare cases of demyelinating neuropathies have been reported in Lyme disease, these are so infrequent as to likely be coincidental [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10939483\"><span class=\"h2\">Central nervous system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Central nervous system involvement in Lyme disease can take several forms. The most common is lymphocytic meningitis. Rarely, inflammation of the brain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> spinal cord parenchyma (an encephalomyelitis) can occur. Some children, most of whom had Lyme meningitis, have presented with a picture resembling pseudotumor cerebri.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24976699\"><span class=\"h3\">Meningitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lymphocytic meningitis, alone or in combination with cranial nerve or spinal nerve root involvement, represents the most common form of central nervous system involvement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F72123\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72123 \">table 3</a>). Clinically, the lymphocytic meningitis of Lyme disease is largely indistinguishable from viral meningitis, with headache, fever, other systemic symptoms, photosensitivity, and neck stiffness. Studies in children suggest that it has a slightly more indolent onset than viral meningitis, with a few more days elapsing between the first symptom and clinical presentation. Proposed algorithms to separate Lyme meningitis from viral meningitis rely on this somewhat less abrupt onset coupled with the presence of other findings suggestive of Lyme disease, such as the percentage of mononuclear cells in the cerebrospinal fluid and the presence of cranial neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Among Lyme disease cases verified by the CDC, approximately 2 percent have meningitis in isolation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Many patients with peripheral or cranial nerve involvement have inflammatory cerebrospinal fluid. Meningeal symptoms in these individuals are highly variable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H42451729\"><span class=\"h3\">Lyme encephalomyelitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>European patients who have Bannwarth syndrome with radicular symptoms (see <a href=\"#H30180706\" class=\"local\">'Bannwarth syndrome'</a> above) occasionally have segmental spinal cord involvement at the same level as the affected nerve root [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. This has been emphasized far less in the United States literature, but it can occur there as well. There have been rare observations in both the United States and Europe of an inflammatory encephalomyelitis associated with Lyme disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. Lyme encephalomyelitis represents a true infection of the neuraxis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F57155\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57155 \">table 4</a>) that can superficially resemble multiple sclerosis, with inflammatory-appearing parenchymal abnormalities on brain or spinal cord MRI and inflammatory changes in the cerebrospinal fluid, including increased total immunoglobulin synthesis and oligoclonal bands. Years ago this disorder was estimated to occur in one person per million at risk per year. The true incidence is probably even lower now that Lyme disease is better recognized and more likely to be treated early.</p><p>Lyme encephalomyelitis is highly responsive to appropriate antimicrobial therapy. However, like any process affecting the central nervous system, there may be neurologic impairments caused by injury that occurred prior to treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H42451858\"><span class=\"h3\">Benign intracranial hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A pseudotumor cerebri-like picture (benign intracranial hypertension) occurs with increased frequency in children with Lyme disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/21,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,37,38</a>]. Virtually all of the reported cases have had inflammatory cerebrospinal fluid, suggesting that the increased intracranial pressure is a result of meningitis, in contradistinction to the usual picture of pseudotumor in which the cerebrospinal fluid profile is normal. Regardless of the mechanism, the symptoms and potential consequences are identical, including compression of cranial nerves with a particular threat to the optic nerves and vision.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10939490\"><span class=\"h3\">Encephalopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early studies found that many patients with active Lyme disease described fatigue, cognitive slowing, and memory difficulty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, these symptoms are nonspecific and are frequent concomitants of many inflammatory disorders. They are not, in isolation, diagnostic of either Lyme disease or brain infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In fact, the term &quot;encephalopathy&quot; was used to describe this state since this term is most often employed to indicate alterations in brain function due to non-neurologic causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Subsequent work demonstrated that only in rare instances were these symptoms associated with brain infection (ie, a mild encephalitis). In such cases, the diagnosis was readily confirmed by cerebrospinal fluid abnormalities and brain MRI findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/9,39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,39-41</a>]. In the absence of such objective evidence of brain infection, these symptoms should <strong>not</strong> be considered evidence of nervous system infection with B. burgdorferi or any other organism.</p><p>In those instances where nervous system infection can be demonstrated, standard antimicrobial therapy is effective. Multiple studies have shown that prolonged antimicrobial treatment offers such patients no lasting benefit but carries significant risk, as reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-lyme-disease#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of Lyme disease&quot;, section on 'Post-Lyme disease syndrome and chronic Lyme disease'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-lyme-disease#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of Lyme disease&quot;, section on 'Lack of benefit from additional antibiotics'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10939497\"><span class=\"h2\">Post-Lyme disease syndrome and chronic Lyme disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A particular challenge has been the sizable population of individuals labeled by some practitioners and patient advocacy groups as having &quot;chronic Lyme disease&quot; on the basis of nonspecific symptoms including persistent musculoskeletal pain, cognitive problems, and fatigue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/7,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,42,43</a>]. In some patients, these symptoms have followed microbiologically successful treatment of Lyme disease, a condition termed &quot;post-Lyme disease syndrome.&quot; Prospective studies suggest post-treatment symptoms occur infrequently, and rarely results in significant functional impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. It seems to happen primarily in patients with multiple comorbid conditions unrelated to Lyme disease who continue to have persistent symptoms during or soon after treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].</p><p>In its typical usage, &quot;chronic Lyme disease&quot; includes the post-Lyme disease syndrome, as well as illnesses and symptom complexes for which there is no convincing scientific evidence of any relationship to B. burgdorferi infection. Regardless of its etiology, this symptom complex can be highly disruptive to day-to-day function, and is poorly understood. However, all objective evidence indicates that these individuals, some of whom suffer from debilitating symptoms, do <strong>not</strong> have chronic infection with B. burgdorferi, are <strong>not</strong> benefited by additional antibiotic treatment, and do <strong>not</strong> have (and have not had) nervous system infection or damage. These problems are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-lyme-disease-in-adults#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Lyme disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Post-Lyme disease syndrome and chronic Lyme disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10939504\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of nervous system Lyme disease rests on three elements:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since the disease is transmitted exclusively by bites of Ixodes ticks, there must be the possibility of exposure</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical disorder should include objective evidence of nervous system Lyme disease</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory testing (positive two tier Lyme serologies with or without positive cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] Lyme antibodies) should support the diagnosis</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4821958\"><span class=\"h2\">Serologic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With the exception of the first four to six weeks of infection, when the specific immune response may not yet have developed sufficiently to provide a measurable antibody response, serologic testing for antibodies to B. burgdorferi is highly sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of Lyme disease, particularly when using the two-tier approach described below. Apart from those uncommon instances when cranial neuropathies or radiculopathies occur during this very early time window, the diagnosis of nervous system Lyme disease should be made only with extreme caution in patients who are seronegative.</p><p>Historically, rare patients were described in whom antibodies were demonstrable in CSF but not blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. A later study confirmed the rarity of this; among 77 patients with a very high <em>a priori</em> likelihood of neuroborreliosis (ie, clear-cut Bannwarth syndrome), negative serology with positive CSF for antibodies to B. burgdorferi was observed in only one patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Consequently, the likelihood of CSF being informative in patients with less specific symptoms and therefore lower <em>a priori</em> likelihood of neuroborreliosis is presumably extremely small. Thus, aside from the setting of a cranial neuropathy or radiculopathy occurring in the first six weeks of infection, the absence of detectable antibodies in the serum is strong evidence against the diagnosis.</p><p>The two-tier strategy, which is recommended by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, uses a sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) followed by a Western blot. An immunofluorescent assay (IFA) may be substituted for the ELISA. If the ELISA is positive or equivocal, then the same serum sample should be tested by Western blot (IgM and IgG immunoblots if early disease is suspected; IgG Western blot alone if late disease is suspected). If the ELISA is negative, the sample needs no further testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-lyme-disease#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of Lyme disease&quot;, section on 'Indications for serologic testing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4821965\"><span class=\"h2\">CSF analysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients presenting with Lyme meningitis, which usually occurs several weeks after erythema migrans, typically have a modest CSF pleocytosis of up to several hundred lymphocytes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> monocytes per microL; the median count in acute neuroborreliosis is approximately 160 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> (160 X 10<sup>6</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. The CSF protein concentration is usually moderately elevated, and is typically no greater than about 200 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L)</span>. The CSF glucose concentration is relatively normal.</p><p>Although headache and neck stiffness are common early symptoms in patients with erythema migrans, particularly with multifocal erythema migrans, a CSF pleocytosis is not necessarily present in these individuals. In a European study of 161 adults with erythema migrans and signs or symptoms thought to raise the possibility of central nervous system involvement, a CSF pleocytosis was present in 31 (19 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The presence of CSF pleocytosis was associated with an increased frequency of radicular pain and meningeal signs, larger erythema migrans skin lesions, the presence of Borrelia garinii compared with other Borrelia species isolated from skin lesions and CSF, and a higher frequency of documented central nervous system infection as defined by isolation of Borrelia from CSF <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intrathecal production of borrelial antibodies. In contrast, headache, neck pain, fatigue, and memory or concentration problems did not predict a CSF pleocytosis or other abnormalities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4821972\"><span class=\"h3\">CSF antibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with suspected central nervous system Lyme disease (ie, Lyme meningitis or encephalomyelitis), testing the CSF for intrathecal production of antibodies to B. burgdorferi is useful for establishing the diagnosis. This test is not applicable if involvement is limited to the peripheral nervous system. Even in central nervous system disease, the sensitivity remains unclear. A negative test for Lyme antibodies in the CSF does not exclude central nervous system Lyme disease.</p><p>As in other infections, in nervous system Lyme disease, specific B cells may migrate to the central nervous system and proliferate locally, resulting in intrathecal production of antibodies to B. burgdorferi. However, even in the absence of nervous system Lyme disease, a measurable proportion of B. burgdorferi-specific antibodies diffuse from the serum to the CSF. Therefore, the presence of B. burgdorferi-specific antibodies in CSF does not itself establish the presence of central nervous system Lyme disease or prove that there is local production of antibodies. Proof requires the simultaneous measurement of B. burgdorferi-specific antibodies in the serum and CSF, adjusting for the total immunoglobulin concentration in each fluid. This can be accomplished by dilution of serum and CSF so that they have the same final concentration of total IgG antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], followed by measurement of B. burgdorferi-specific antibodies in both compartments; a higher level in the CSF compared with the serum suggests local production of specific antibodies in the CSF. Alternatively an antibody capture enzyme immunoassay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>] can be used to obtain these proportions more directly.</p><p>Although CSF or serum B. burgdorferi antibody concentrations typically decline after treatment, these antibodies, and the relative excess in the CSF, may persist for 10 or more years following successful treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Thus, determination of active neuroborreliosis requires combining these results with less specific measures of active central nervous system inflammation (ie, a CSF pleocytosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> elevated protein).</p><p>CSF B. burgdorferi antibody measurement is highly specific for nervous system Lyme disease, with cross-reactions occurring primarily in neurosyphilis. However, neurosyphilis usually results in production of reaginic antibodies in the CSF, such as those measured in the venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test, and Lyme disease does not. Thus, differentiating between these two spirochetal infections is generally straightforward.</p><p>Determination of test sensitivity is far more challenging, primarily because the studies that have attempted to address this issue have used quite different patient populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. In Europe, local production of anti-B. burgdorferi antibody has long been considered a requirement for diagnosis and is still required to diagnose definite neuroborreliosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. In a study of patients with clinically unambiguous Bannwarth syndrome, 11 percent lacked intrathecal antibody production and therefore could not be diagnosed as &quot;definite&quot; neuroborreliosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Prior European studies similarly suggested sensitivity of about 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/46,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,54</a>], although given the European Federation of Neurological Sciences&nbsp;definition, this may be subject to ascertainment bias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/25,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,53</a>]. Similarly, in studies from the United States, estimates of sensitivity have ranged from about 90 percent in a cohort with Lyme meningitis to about 50 percent in a more heterogeneous patient group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In a patient with a clinical picture suggesting Lyme disease, a positive study from a reputable laboratory should be viewed as significant evidence in favor of the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, negative CSF studies should not eliminate neurologic Lyme disease from consideration if clinical circumstances support the diagnosis.</p><p>As in other infections in which there is a prominent antibody response, when nervous system Lyme disease has been present long enough for the B cell response to mature, there are often increases not only in specific anti-B. burgdorferi antibodies but also in nonspecific immunoglobulin concentrations. Measures such as the IgG synthesis rate or IgG index can be elevated, and, particularly in patients in Europe with central nervous system Lyme disease, oligoclonal bands can be seen in the CSF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/39,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,55</a>]. The frequency with which these findings are found has varied widely among series. The important point is that oligoclonal bands and increased IgG synthesis occur in central nervous system infections including central nervous system Lyme disease, and consequently do not help differentiate these disorders from multiple sclerosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in adults&quot;, section on 'Oligoclonal bands'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4822015\"><span class=\"h3\">Polymerase chain reaction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for B. burgdorferi can be performed on CSF, although it has low diagnostic sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>], probably reflecting the very low number of organisms typically present in spinal fluid. Between this low sensitivity, and a tendency for some laboratories to have difficulty avoiding false positives, the positive and negative predictive values both tend to be low, rendering this test of marginal utility. For that reason, PCR is not recommended for routine clinical testing of CSF in Lyme disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-lyme-disease#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of Lyme disease&quot;, section on 'Polymerase chain reaction'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H43076349\"><span class=\"h3\">CXCL13</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although elevated concentrations of the chemokine CXCL13 are not unique to active nervous system Lyme disease, when combined with other diagnostic information, they might serve as a marker of disease activity or response to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Like patients with neurosyphilis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>], patients with acute untreated nervous system Lyme disease and a CSF pleocytosis have elevated CSF concentrations of the B lymphocyte chemoattractant, CXCL13 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Among 17 such patients, concentrations of CXCL13 were proportionately greater in CSF than in serum and were highly elevated in all CSF samples compared with the CSF of 178 controls without nervous system Lyme disease (mean 15,149 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> versus 247 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Five patients who had received at least two weeks of treatment for nervous system Lyme disease did not have substantially elevated CXCL13 concentrations (mean 202 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL),</span> whereas five patients who had been treated for less than two weeks had slightly elevated CXCL13 concentrations (mean 1412 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL)</span>. Among the 178 controls, seven had an elevated CXCL13 concentration, five with CNS lymphoma and two with bacterial meningitis. Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis has also been reported to cause elevated levels of CXCL13 in the CSF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>These observations, coupled with PCR-based findings in patients with early nervous system Lyme disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], and the frequent description of increased immunoglobulin production including the presence of oligoclonal bands in CSF of neuroborreliosis patients, suggest the following pathophysiologic sequence. Spirochetes invade the central nervous system very early in infection and elicit a vigorous innate immunity-triggered B cell response, leading to prolonged antibody production.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4822126\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since Lyme encephalomyelitis is so rare, MRI of the brain and spine is only rarely abnormal in Lyme disease. When present, encephalomyelitis is evident on MRI as areas of increased signal on T2 and FLAIR sequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. When these areas are large and active, positron emission tomography (PET) demonstrates them to be hypermetabolic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. Single photon emission computed tomographic (SPECT) brain scans have been used with increasing frequency. In one study, quantitative SPECT, applied in a highly selected group of patients with well-characterized nervous system Lyme disease, demonstrated patchy brain hypometabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. However qualitative brain SPECT, the technique used in clinical laboratories, is highly variable even in normal patients, and has no positive or negative predictive value in nervous system Lyme disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H445548\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrophysiologic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with a peripheral neuropathy, electrophysiologic assessment (electromyography and nerve conduction studies) can be helpful. In such patients, these studies typically reveal findings consistent with a patchy axonal polyneuropathy (ie, a mononeuropathy multiplex) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24976859\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to diagnostic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessment of the patient with possible nervous system Lyme disease must be tailored to the specific presentation. In a patient with possible meningitis, CSF examination is mandatory to exclude other, potentially more dangerous pathogens. In these circumstances, CSF studies should include cell count and differential, protein and glucose concentrations, and gram stain and bacterial cultures. CSF and serum should both be studied for anti-B. burgdorferi antibodies and VDRL should be measured. Assessment for oligoclonal bands and IgG synthesis can be informative but is not usually essential. Other potential causes of meningitis should be addressed specifically as appropriate, with testing for herpes simplex virus, West Nile virus, enteroviruses, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other organisms as suggested by individual circumstances. Neuroimaging of the appropriate segment of the neuraxis, preferably by MRI, should precede the lumbar puncture if the patient has clinical evidence of parenchymal brain involvement. Depending on the findings on imaging, additional CSF studies might include oligoclonal bands and IgG synthesis, CSF cytology <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other studies as dictated by the specific circumstances.</p><p>Whether or not to assess CSF in patients with facial nerve palsy or Garin-Bujadoux-Bannwarth syndrome (see <a href=\"#H30180706\" class=\"local\">'Bannwarth syndrome'</a> above) is a subject of debate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Although European authorities generally favor doing this, multiple European studies have shown that oral antibiotics are as effective as parenteral regimens in Lyme meningitis and in the Garin-Bujadoux-Bannwarth syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. In light of this, a reasonable approach would be to perform a lumbar puncture if the diagnosis is unclear, but to simply administer oral antibiotics to patients with recent exposure, a positive serology and an appropriate clinical syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. In patients with nonfocal cognitive difficulties, memory or psychiatric issues, and nothing to suggest Lyme meningitis or encephalomyelitis, brain imaging and CSF examinations are rarely abnormal. Neuropsychologic testing can help quantitate deficits in such individuals, but generally lacks sufficient specificity to prove that a problem is or is not due to Lyme disease.</p><p>In patients with peripheral nerve involvement, electrophysiologic assessment (electromyography and nerve conduction studies) can be helpful in assessing both the type and distribution of nerve damage. This may be unnecessary in patients with simple facial nerve palsy, but can be helpful in more complex situations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10939511\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Academy of Neurology published practice guidelines for the treatment of Lyme disease in the United States in 2006 and 2007, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nervous-system-lyme-disease/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>].
