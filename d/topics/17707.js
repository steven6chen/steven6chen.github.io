Its psychoactive properties are primarily due to one cannabinoid: delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC); THC concentration is commonly used as a measure of cannabis potency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-cannabis-withdrawal/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Cannabis withdrawal is manifested by a constellation of signs and symptoms occurring within one week after abrupt reduction or cessation of heavy and prolonged cannabis use; the syndrome typically includes irritability, anger, anxiety, depression, and disturbed sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-cannabis-withdrawal/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Physical symptoms, such as abdominal discomfort, headache, muscle tremors, or twitching, are relatively uncommon.</p><p>Treatment of cannabis withdrawal is reviewed here.

Individuals in mild withdrawal do not typically present seeking treatment. They may self-treat; in our experience, improved sleep hygiene, meditation and relaxation techniques, and physical exercise can be helpful for mild symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H125521208\" class=\"local\">'Mild withdrawal'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that newly abstinent, formerly heavy-cannabis users be treated for symptoms of cannabis withdrawal when the symptoms cause daily functional impairment or a significantly increased risk of relapse (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The choice of treatment depends on the modality&rsquo;s availability, the nature of the symptoms that are most bothersome to the patient, potential concerns related to drug testing, and the patient&rsquo;s preference for medication versus cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). (See <a href=\"#H2543011511\" class=\"local\">'New presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients meeting the symptom threshold, and in Canada and certain European countries where the medication is available, we suggest treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nabiximols-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nabiximols</a> rather than other medications (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dronabinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dronabinol</a> is a reasonable alternative when nabiximols is not available. (See <a href=\"#H632061937\" class=\"local\">'Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients meeting the symptom threshold who face urine drug screening (eg, for legal or occupational reasons), we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a> over other medications (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2532679398\" class=\"local\">'Gabapentin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients meeting the symptom threshold who strongly prefer psychotherapy to medication, we suggest CBT rather than other therapies (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2080016966\" class=\"local\">'Cognitive-behavioral therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients whose primary withdrawal symptom is sleep disturbance impairing functioning or increasing risk of relapse, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zolpidem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zolpidem</a> rather than other medications (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrazepam-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Nitrazepam</a> is a reasonable alternative if zolpidem is ineffective. (See <a href=\"#H679932649\" class=\"local\">'Sleep disturbance'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3071518913\" class=\"local\">'Zolpidem'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3814588783\" class=\"local\">'Nitrazepam'</a> above.)</p><p/><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, World Drug Report 2016, Vienna 2016.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-cannabis-withdrawal/abstract/2\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Swift W, Wong A, Li KM, et al.
