These events mostly occur in patients with structural heart disease (that may not have been previously diagnosed), particularly coronary heart disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and etiology of sudden cardiac arrest&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The event is referred to as SCA (or aborted SCD) if an intervention (eg, defibrillation) or spontaneous reversion restores circulation. The event is called SCD if the patient dies. However, the use of SCD to describe both fatal and nonfatal cardiac arrest persists by convention.

Case definitions are inconsistent and etiologies vary according to the population studied. Common causes of SCD include coronary heart disease, structural heart disease not related to CHD (eg, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, nonischemic cardiomyopathy, etc), arrhythmias caused by primarily electrical disease (eg, Brugada syndrome, long QT syndrome, etc), and transient or reversible causes (eg, medication toxicity, electrolyte abnormalities, etc).</p><p>A detailed review of the causes of SCD is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and etiology of sudden cardiac arrest&quot;, section on 'Etiology of SCD'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation begins immediately after resuscitation. The first concern is to exclude any obvious reversible factors that may have led to the event (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52416\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52416 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">History and physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient (if awake) and family should be questioned, with particular attention to the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior diagnoses of heart disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of any medications, especially antiarrhythmic drugs, diuretics, and drugs that might produce long QT syndrome</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ingestion of toxins or illicit drugs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antecedent symptoms, especially evidence of ischemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antecedent stressful events or activities</p><p/><p>Unfortunately, the cardiac arrest is frequently unwitnessed. In addition, the patient resuscitated from VF often has retrograde amnesia and is unable to remember what occurred prior to the cardiac arrest. Thus, a coherent history may not be ascertainable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immediate evaluation should include standard laboratory testing and, in many cases, an arterial blood gas to exclude electrolyte abnormalities and acidosis. Any reversible metabolic abnormalities should be identified and corrected, particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia which can predispose to ventricular tachyarrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-survivor-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>When interpreting the test results, two important limitations should be considered:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrolyte abnormalities during and shortly after resuscitation may be secondary to cardiac arrest and hypoperfusion as opposed to a cause of SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-survivor-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrolyte abnormalities by themselves are usually insufficient to cause SCD. Clinical settings that increase the proarrhythmic effect of hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia include acute myocardial infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-survivor-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], overt heart failure, and long QT syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-long-qt-syndrome-definitions-causes-and-pathophysiology#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired long QT syndrome: Definitions, causes, and pathophysiology&quot;, section on 'Hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia'</a>.)</p><p/><p>It is potentially hazardous to ascribe a cardiac arrest to an electrolyte or metabolic derangement alone, unless there is compelling evidence of an association. Mistaken attribution of a major arrhythmia to an innocent or merely potentiating laboratory abnormality can place the patient at high risk if appropriate therapy to prevent recurrent SCD is delayed or not given. Importantly, electrolyte and pH abnormalities may be secondary to the arrhythmia itself.</p><p>This risk was illustrated in a review of 169 patients treated with an ICD for sustained ventricular arrhythmia in whom the plasma potassium concentration was measured on the day of the arrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-survivor-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The likelihood of a recurrent sustained ventricular arrhythmia was 82 percent at five years. The long-term risk was similar in patients with low, normal, and high plasma potassium concentrations at presentation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrocardiogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ECG can reveal evidence of both acute abnormalities and chronic conditions. It should be part of the immediate evaluation and repeated as necessary once the patient's cardiac, hemodynamic, and metabolic condition stabilizes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-survivor-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

The initial history, physical examination, and laboratory tests may provide evidence of one of these disorders, but further testing is usually necessary to confirm a diagnosis.</p><p>The standard evaluation typically includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ECG (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Electrocardiogram'</a> above)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac catheterization with coronary angiography</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Echocardiography</p><p/><p>In the appropriate clinical setting, coronary angiography and echocardiography may be part of the urgent initial evaluation.</p><p>In selected patients, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and, rarely, myocardial biopsy are performed.

Among patients with an ACS, malignant arrhythmias are significantly more common in the setting of an acute ST elevation MI (STEMI), but are also seen in approximately 2 percent of patients with a non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI). In patients with an ACS and ischemia, the arrhythmia is usually polymorphic VT, rapid VT (ventricular flutter), or VF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-treatment-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-acute-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and treatment of ventricular arrhythmias during acute myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A patient with evidence of an STEMI following resuscitation from SCD should undergo urgent cardiac catheterization and primary PCI (or in some cases surgical revascularization) as appropriate. Similarly, patients with a confirmed or suspected NSTEMI should also undergo cardiac catheterization with revascularization as indicated.

However, among patients who survive to hospital discharge there is little or no difference in mortality at one to two years. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-treatment-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-acute-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and treatment of ventricular arrhythmias during acute myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnostic angiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In SCD survivors without an ACS, angiography is still considered to exclude stable, chronic CHD, which, as indicated above, is the leading cause for SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-survivor-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Malignant arrhythmias and SCD occur in such patients, usually those who have had a prior infarction with residual myocardial scar. In contrast to patients with an ACS, the culprit arrhythmia is usually scar-related monomorphic VT, which is not the result of ischemia. However, monomorphic VT can ultimately degenerate to VF, particularly if the arrhythmia induces ischemia. Because SCD may be the first clinical evidence of chronic CHD, most SCD survivors undergo diagnostic angiography prior to discharge.</p><p>Even for patients arriving at the hospital in refractory <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/VF</span> who are receiving ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), immediate coronary angiography appears beneficial in a carefully selected group of patients (18 to 75 years of age with <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/VF</span> as initial rhythm who received three shocks and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> loading dose and who can be in the catheterization lab in &lt;30 minutes post-arrest) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-survivor-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Among a cohort of 55 patients who met these criteria (after excluding 7 of 62 who were declared deceased on arrival to the catheterization lab), all of whom were started on extracorporeal life support and underwent immediate coronary angiography, 46 patients (84 percent) had significant obstructive CHD, including 35 patients (64 percent) with acute thrombus, all of whom underwent percutaneous coronary intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-survivor-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Among the cohort, 26 patients (42 percent) were discharged alive with favorable neurologic function, compared with 15 percent of historical controls.</p><p>Diagnostic coronary angiography may not be necessary in selected patients without signs or symptoms of CHD if another clear cause for SCD is identified (eg, long QT syndrome, WPW, Brugada, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, left ventricular noncompaction, or arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy).</p><p>Angiography is suggested in younger patients without an apparent cause for SCD in whom angiography may also detect an anomalous origin of a coronary artery.

Such patients usually have evidence of preexcitation on their ECG. If preexcitation is evident on an ECG in a survivor of SCD, EP study and ablation of the accessory pathway are usually indicated.

The prognostic value of inducible arrhythmias is best established in patients with prior myocardial infarction and reduced LV systolic function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=incidence-of-and-risk-stratification-for-sudden-cardiac-death-after-acute-myocardial-infarction#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Incidence of and risk stratification for sudden cardiac death after acute myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'Inducible VT/VF'</a>.)</p><p/><p>There is evidence that inducible VF, particularly when induced repeatedly with nonaggressive protocols, suggests the diagnosis of idiopathic VF and may predict recurrent arrhythmic events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-survivor-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. In a review of the literature, 69 percent of patients with idiopathic VF had a sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia induced with a nonaggressive protocol; induced arrhythmia was generally polymorphic in configuration and poorly tolerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-survivor-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>In some other conditions it is not clear that inducible VT or VF has prognostic significance (eg, Brugada syndrome, infiltrative diseases, HCM). Furthermore, aggressive stimulation protocols can induce polymorphic VT or VF in some individuals without cardiac disease. Thus, inducible arrhythmias can be a nonspecific finding. For this reason, the significance of inducible ventricular arrhythmias in patients with apparently normal hearts is unclear. On the other hand, the absence of inducible <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/VF</span> may not preclude ICD implantation since lack of inducibility does not predict low risk.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myocardial scar &ndash; Substrate mapping may identify areas of scar indicating abnormal substrate and a predisposition to ventricular arrhythmia. These abnormalities are more commonly seen in patients with CHD, HCM, ARVC, or infiltrative diseases, but also occur in some cases of idiopathic VF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-survivor-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In addition, some patients with idiopathic VF have other electrophysiologic abnormalities, including areas of slow conduction, regionally delayed repolarization, or dispersion in repolarization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-survivor-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supraventricular arrhythmias &ndash; Patients in whom VT or VF was not well documented at the time of SCD may have another culprit arrhythmia, usually a supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). In such patients, SVT may be inducible during EP study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-survivor-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Exercise testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exercise testing is not usually part of the CHD evaluation in SCD survivors, since most undergo coronary angiography. However, the provocation of ischemia with exercise, independently of coronary anatomy, is of importance in the evaluation of the SCD survivor. Although angiography alone does not prove a causal relationship to SCD or the presence of ischemia, the observation that revascularization appears to improve outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-survivor-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/9,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,18,19</a>] means that a negative exercise test in a patient with significant coronary disease on angiography is not likely to affect the decision on revascularization. Also of great importance is the provocation of VT or VF in these patients, which would predict a higher recurrence rate. It is also a target for adjunctive antiarrhythmic therapy in addition to an ICD. While VT (which is often scar mediated and provoked by catecholamines) may be provoked during exercise, VF most commonly occurs after exercise in the recovery period (when ischemia is more common). </p><p>In patients with apparently normal hearts, exercise testing can assist in the diagnosis of long QT syndrome and catecholaminergic polymorphic VT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-survivor-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=catecholaminergic-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-and-other-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardias-with-a-normal-qt-interval\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and other polymorphic ventricular tachycardias with a normal QT interval&quot;</a>). It is also useful in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern as the resolution of the delta wave with exercise generally correlates with low likelihood of a rapid ventricular rate with atrial fibrillation which is the etiology for VF and SCD in these patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Ambulatory monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients without a clear etiology for SCD, ambulatory monitoring may reveal recurrent sustained or nonsustained arrhythmias.
