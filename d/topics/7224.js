Acute FDE usually presents with a single or a small number of dusky red or violaceous plaques that resolve leaving postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F86671%7EDERM%2F52192%7EDERM%2F73678\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86671 graphicRef52192 graphicRef73678 \">picture 1A-C</a>).

CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with an effector-memory phenotype are abundantly detected along the dermoepidermal junction in established FDE lesions and persist in resting FDE lesions long after the clinical resolution (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F86641%7EDERM%2F86642\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86641 graphicRef86642 \">picture 2A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fixed-drug-eruption/abstract/11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-15</a>]. </p><p>Sequential analysis of FDE lesions before and after rechallenge with the causative drug demonstrated that intraepidermal CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are directly involved in epidermal damage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F86643\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86643 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fixed-drug-eruption/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells remain quiescent but in a primed state in healed FDE lesions unless the causative drug is readministered.

Mast cells also contribute to the activation of intraepidermal T cells via the induction of cell adhesion molecules on the surrounding keratinocytes, through the action of tumor necrosis factor alpha [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fixed-drug-eruption/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>The activation of intraepidermal T cells is sufficient for triggering the reaction but insufficient to cause the extensive tissue damage observed in fully evolved lesions. Cytokines <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> adhesion molecule-mediated recruitment of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and neutrophils may contribute to tissue damage in fully developed FDE lesions. </p><p>In the late stage of the immune response, CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> regulatory T (Treg) cells are recruited into the lesion and participate in the homeostatic control of the immune reaction. The majority of the expanded or activated cell populations responsible for epidermal damage are eventually removed from tissue by apoptosis. However, a proportion of intraepidermal CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is prevented from undergoing apoptosis by IL-15 secreted by basal keratinocytes and persists at the injury site as a memory T cell population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fixed-drug-eruption/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1512201\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOPATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Histologically, FDE is the prototype of a lichenoid tissue reaction with pigmentary incontinence (accumulation of melanin in the upper dermis and dermal macrophages) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fixed-drug-eruption/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In florid lesions, major features include hydropic degeneration of basal keratinocytes, dyskeratotic cells scattered in the epidermis, lymphocytic infiltration of the dermis, and dermal melanophages.

The number, distribution, and morphology of lesions help to differentiate EM from FDE. Target lesions consisting of three components (a dusky central area or blister, a dark red inflammatory zone surrounded by a pale ring of edema, and an erythematous halo) are the hallmark of EM (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F79955\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79955 \">picture 10</a>).

Antibacterial sulfonamides, antibiotics, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, analgesics, and hypnotics are the most frequent causes of FDE. (See <a href=\"#H1633148\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H56452388\" class=\"local\">'Eliciting drugs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FDE typically presents with solitary round to oval, dusky red to <span class=\"nowrap\">brown/black</span> macules that may evolve into edematous plaques or bullae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F52192%7EDERM%2F86671%7EDERM%2F67733\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52192 graphicRef86671 graphicRef67733 \">picture 1A-B, 1D</a>). Sites of predilection include the lips, genitalia, perianal area, and extremities.
