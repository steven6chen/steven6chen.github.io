The patient&rsquo;s distress comes primarily from an unfounded fear of having a disease rather than physical symptoms, and persists despite appropriate physical examination and laboratory testing that are negative. Physical symptoms are not present, or they are minimal and often represent a misperception of normal bodily sensations. Illness anxiety disorder is usually chronic. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder conceptually overlaps with the prior Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fourth Edition, Text Revision, diagnosis of hypochondriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/illness-anxiety-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>This topic reviews the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, assessment, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder.

(See <a href=\"#H7947242\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H7947249\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.) </p><p>Illness anxiety disorder was derived in part from the diagnosis of hypochondriasis, which was eliminated from DSM-5. In DSM-5, patients previously diagnosed with hypochondriasis are nearly always diagnosed with either somatic symptom disorder (if physical complaints are prominent) or illness anxiety disorder (if physical complaints are minimal or nonexistent). Although relatively few studies of illness anxiety disorder have been published, there is a larger literature on the symptom of health anxiety, defined as persistent unrealistic worry or conviction about having an illness. The spectrum of health anxiety ranges from none to severe, with the severe end representing a clinical endpoint (such as illness anxiety disorder or hypochondriasis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/illness-anxiety-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. </p><p>In the previous edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (Fourth Edition, Text Revision; DSM-IV-TR), the term hypochondriasis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F68413\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68413 \">table 2</a>) described patients who misinterpreted one or more bodily symptoms and believed that they had a serious disease or were preoccupied with fear of a disease, despite appropriate medical evaluation and reassurance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/illness-anxiety-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Both the DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of hypochondriasis and the DSM-5 diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder include patients who believe that they have a serious disease or are preoccupied with fear of a disease, despite a normal physical examination, negative tests, and reassurance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/illness-anxiety-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Among patients previously diagnosed with hypochondriasis, it is estimated that approximately 75 percent are subsumed under the DSM-5 diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder and 25 percent under the DSM-5 diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/illness-anxiety-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Support for these estimates include a retrospective study of patients who initially received a DSM-IV diagnosis of hypochondriasis (n = 58); post-hoc application of DSM-5 criteria found that 76 percent met criteria for somatic symptom disorder and 24 percent met criteria for illness anxiety disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/illness-anxiety-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Patients with somatic symptom and related disorders typically present to primary care clinicians and general medical specialists rather than psychiatrists. Additional information about somatic symptom and related disorders is discussed separately.

The essential feature of the ICD-10 diagnosis is a persistent preoccupation with having a serious general medical illness. In addition, patients manifest somatic symptoms or are preoccupied with their physical appearance. Patients often misinterpret normal bodily sensations as abnormal and are frequently depressed or anxious.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7947228\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of illness anxiety disorder is largely unknown because it was introduced as a diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), which was published in 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/illness-anxiety-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Illness anxiety disorder was derived in part from the diagnosis of hypochondriasis, which was eliminated from DSM-5. It is estimated that among individuals who were diagnosed with hypochondriasis, approximately 25 percent would qualify for a diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder. In addition, the prevalence of illness anxiety disorder can be estimated from studies of individuals with symptoms of health anxiety (persistent unrealistic worry or conviction about having an illness), which is a broad construct that exists along a continuum and presumably has a greater prevalence than illness anxiety disorder. (See <a href=\"#H44384494\" class=\"local\">'Terminology and DSM-5'</a> above.)</p><p>The estimated prevalence of illness anxiety disorder depends upon the study sample and setting, and it is thought that illness anxiety <span class=\"nowrap\">disorder/health</span> anxiety presents far more often in general medical clinics than other settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/illness-anxiety-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>General medical outpatients</strong> &ndash; The prevalence of illness anxiety disorder in medical outpatients (eg, family practice and primary care) is approximately 0.75 percent, based upon a pooled analysis of 12 studies that found the prevalence of hypochondriasis was 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/illness-anxiety-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

In a different set of seven community surveys, symptoms of health anxiety occurred in 2 to 13 percent of community adults. &#160; &#160; </p><p/><p>Age of onset for illness anxiety disorder is not known. Hypochondriasis is most common in early adulthood and rarely begins after the age of 50 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/illness-anxiety-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9</a>]. Health anxiety occurs across the lifespan but appears to be more common between ages 35 to 64 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/illness-anxiety-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>Hypochondriasis and health anxiety occur in both sexes in approximately a one-to-one ratio and are not associated with marital status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/illness-anxiety-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].

Hypochondriasis and health anxiety are more common in less educated patients and often accompanied by disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/illness-anxiety-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7947235\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of illness anxiety disorder is not known. However, some inferences can be drawn from studies of hypochondriasis and the symptom of health anxiety (persistent unrealistic worry or conviction about having an illness). Psychosocial etiologies of hypochondriasis and health anxiety have been examined more than biological causes.</p><p>Illness anxiety disorder is a diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F104206\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104206 \">table 1</a>) that was introduced with publication of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) in 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/illness-anxiety-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

In addition, the pathogenesis of illness anxiety disorder can be inferred from studies of individuals with symptoms of health anxiety (persistent unrealistic worry or conviction about having an illness).

In this model, the disorder is characterized by excessive and persistent anxiety about threats to one&rsquo;s health; the anxiety is due to normal body sensations that are perceived as abnormally intense and misattributed to serious medical disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/illness-anxiety-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. The patient then seeks assurance of good health. In illness anxiety disorder, actual physical symptoms are absent or not the dominant concern; rather, the patient essentially has a fear of developing a serious medical disease.</p><p>In the cognitive-behavioral model, risk factors for hypochondriasis, and likely for illness anxiety disorder, include dysfunctional assumptions about the prevalence and communicability of severe illnesses, the meaning of bodily symptoms, and the course and treatment of illnesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/illness-anxiety-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. As an example, patients may believe that good health is a symptom-free state, or overestimate their vulnerability to developing disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/illness-anxiety-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/13,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16,17</a>]. The dysfunctional assumptions may stem from early family experiences and childhood illness. Abnormal illness behavior in parents (eg, their own high health anxiety or excessive worry about illness in their children), as well as a child's exposure to serious parental illness, appears to increase the risk of somatic symptom disorders in adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/illness-anxiety-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>An event, such as reading about an illness or hearing about the illness of an acquaintance or celebrity, can activate dysfunctional assumptions and lead to excessive illness anxiety. Patients may increasingly monitor their bodily sensations for any sign of the illness, and amplify or exaggerate any evidence of illness. Normal somatic feelings are then prone to be misinterpreted as ominous. The misinterpretation triggers anxiety, which patients attempt to reduce by seeking assurance of good health from physicians <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> alternative care providers or remedies.</p><p>Despite medical reassurance, patients with illness anxiety disorder remain anxious about their health. One reason is that patients vigilantly monitor their bodies for symptoms and become sensitive to slight homeostatic fluctuations that occur normally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/illness-anxiety-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>In addition, it is thought that illness anxiety leads patients to confirm their fears through selective attention toward information that is consistent with having a disease and away from information that is consistent with good health. Support for this hypothesis includes a randomized trial that enrolled undergraduate students (n = 60, not selected for any psychopathology) and assigned them to spend one week frequently engaged in safety behaviors (such as checking one&rsquo;s body or using the internet to research health information), or to spend one week monitoring their normal use of safety behaviors (controls) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/illness-anxiety-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Health anxiety increased more in the group frequently engaging in safety behaviors, compared with controls. </p><p>Avoidance behavior may also maintain illness anxiety symptoms. As an example, patients who erroneously believe that they have cardiac disease may avoid physical exertion because they think this will exacerbate their condition; patients thus lose the opportunity to verify their good health and correct the mistaken belief.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3712862\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics and biological correlates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The genetics of illness anxiety disorder and hypochondriasis are unknown, and there is little information about their neurobiology. A family study found that the prevalence of hypochondriasis was comparable in 72 first-degree relatives of patients with hypochondriasis and in 97 relatives of controls, but interpreting the results is difficult due to the small number of individuals involved and the relatively low incidence of the illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/illness-anxiety-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Studies of biologic correlates have found that compared with healthy controls, patients with hypochondriasis have decreased levels of plasma neurotrophin-3 and platelet serotonin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/illness-anxiety-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], and smaller pituitary volumes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/illness-anxiety-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Another observational study (n = 24) found that individuals with high levels of health anxiety focused more upon body symptom words (eg, dizziness, headache, and nausea) compared with individuals with low levels of health anxiety, and that this attentional bias toward body symptom words was&nbsp;associated with hypoactivity of the rostral anterior cingulate cortex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/illness-anxiety-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, due to the cross-sectional design of these neurobiologic studies, it is unclear whether the abnormalities represent etiologic causes, sequelae, neither, or both. In addition, the studies were small.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7947242\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features of illness anxiety disorder discussed in this section are based in large part upon studies of hypochondriasis, as well as studies of individuals with symptoms of health anxiety (persistent unrealistic worry or conviction about having an illness).

Patients may be preoccupied with a particular diagnosis (eg, cancer or HIV infection), a bodily function (eg, bowel movements), normal variation in function (eg, in heart rate or blood pressure), or vague somatic sensation (eg, &ldquo;tired heart&rdquo;). The patient&rsquo;s concern may involve one or more organ systems, and the focus of concern may shift over time from one organ or disease to another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/illness-anxiety-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>The degree of insight varies; some patients recognize that their disease fears are excessive, while others firmly maintain their convictions. However, the belief is not of delusional intensity, and patients can acknowledge the possibility that their disease fears are exaggerated or that there may be no disease at all.</p><p>The concern about the feared illness often becomes a central feature of the patient&rsquo;s life, and psychosocial functioning may suffer (see <a href=\"#H235454179\" class=\"local\">'Functioning'</a> below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/illness-anxiety-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,25</a>]. Many patients check their bodies to reassure themselves; examples of illness anxiety behavior include excessive breast self-examination or blood pressure and pulse monitoring. This behavior may increase during times of stress. In addition, health anxiety does not abate despite the benign course of the feared disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/illness-anxiety-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>The preoccupation with illness typically leads to high health care utilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/illness-anxiety-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,10,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10,26</a>], with multiple normal examinations and laboratory tests that do not allay the patient&rsquo;s concern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/illness-anxiety-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/11,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,25</a>]. Patients may press their physicians to order progressively more invasive diagnostic tests and higher-risk treatments, which can reinforce the disorder and increase the probability of iatrogenic complications. Seeking care from multiple clinicians (&quot;doctor-shopping&quot;) is also common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/illness-anxiety-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Despite extensive medical attention, patients with illness anxiety disorder often are disappointed and frustrated with their clinicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/illness-anxiety-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/25,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,27</a>]. Clinicians in turn may become frustrated because their efforts at managing and reassuring the patient seem futile.</p><p>Some patients fear iatrogenic illness (eg, adverse medication effects or radiation exposure), avoid mainstream medical clinicians, and pursue a diagnosis and remedy through complementary and alternative practitioners. In addition, many patients use the internet to obtain information about prevention of feared diseases, and consume vitamins, over-the-counter remedies, and fad diets.</p><p>General medical illnesses may be present or may arise in patients with illness anxiety disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/illness-anxiety-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,28</a>].

Patients may worry about having an occult disease during its early stage, when signs on physical examination or laboratory test abnormalities are not readily apparent. This may be more frequent when there is a strong family history of a serious medical illness (eg, breast cancer, Alzheimer dementia, or coronary heart disease) or the serious disease has an insidious onset (eg, AIDS or ovarian or pancreatic cancer).

Health related anxiety in response to the threat or experience of serious medical illness is normal and is not a psychiatric disorder; this nonpathological health anxiety is clearly related to the medical disease, is proportionate to its seriousness, and typically abates over time (eg, within two to three months). By contrast, patients with illness anxiety disorder are preoccupied with or anxious about their medical condition to a degree that is clearly excessive and disproportionate, and the health related anxiety persists for at least six months. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Adjustment disorder</strong> &ndash; Patients with or at significant risk for general medical conditions may develop illness anxiety disorder or an adjustment disorder with anxiety. Both illness anxiety disorder and adjustment disorder are characterized by disproportionate behavioral responses to the general medical illness, as well as impaired functioning. However, adjustment disorder is a residual diagnosis and is not diagnosed if the patient meets criteria for another specific disorder, such as illness anxiety disorder. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Somatic symptom disorder</strong> &ndash; Both somatic symptom disorder and illness anxiety disorder are characterized by prominent somatic concerns that are accompanied by distress and impaired functioning. However, patients with somatic symptom disorder have significant somatic symptoms; typically there are multiple concurrent symptoms, but there may be only one severe symptom, such as pain. By contrast, somatic symptoms in illness anxiety disorder are at most minimal, and patients are more preoccupied with the idea that they are sick. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=somatic-symptom-disorder-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Somatic symptom disorder: Epidemiology and clinical presentation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=somatic-symptom-disorder-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Somatic symptom disorder: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Generalized anxiety disorder</strong> &ndash; Patients with generalized anxiety disorder may worry excessively about illness but are also preoccupied with other issues, such as relationships, work, or finances. By contrast, the concern in illness anxiety disorder is restricted to having or developing an illness, and illness anxiety disorder is diagnosed only if the patient is solely preoccupied with or anxious about having an illness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=generalized-anxiety-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Generalized anxiety disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Obsessive-compulsive disorder</strong> &ndash; Although illness anxiety disorder may include intrusive thoughts about having a disease (obsession) and associated compulsive behaviors (eg, seeking reassurance), the disorder does not include the stereotyped, repetitive, ritualized behaviors that characterize obsessive-compulsive disorder. Most patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder have obsessions or compulsions involving other concerns (eg, checking locks, counting, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> keeping strict order) in addition to fears about contracting disease. Illness anxiety disorder is diagnosed when the predominant concerns are restricted to health and disease.

However, specific phobia involves a specific object or situation, such as animals, seeing blood, heights, receiving an injection, or flying. Patients with illness anxiety disorder are preoccupied with fears of having or acquiring a serious disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=specific-phobia-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis#H19509096\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Specific phobia in adults: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, course and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Panic disorder</strong> &ndash; Panic attacks can occur in both illness anxiety disorder and panic disorder, and both disorders are characterized by hypervigilance to benign somatic sensations. One distinction between the two disorders is that panic attacks in illness anxiety disorder are triggered by health fears, whereas the triggers in panic disorder are typically not limited to health concerns. In addition, health fears in illness anxiety disorder occur frequently, are persistent and enduring, and are not amenable to reassurance. Although patients with panic disorder may fear an imminent medical catastrophe (eg, myocardial infarction), these fears occur only during panic attacks, and patients usually are amenable to reassurance that their symptoms are panic attacks and not a myocardial infarction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=panic-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis#H111733801\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Panic disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Body dysmorphic disorder</strong> &ndash; Patients with illness anxiety disorder and body dysmorphic disorder are both preoccupied with perceived body abnormalities, excessively perform behaviors, such as checking their body, and may exhibit maladaptive avoidance. However, the preoccupation in illness anxiety disorder is with having or acquiring a serious illness, whereas the preoccupation in body dysmorphic disorder is with being ugly or deformed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Psychotic disorders</strong> &ndash; Psychotic patients may be convinced that they are ill as a result of somatic delusions (false, fixed beliefs about the body). By contrast, patients with illness anxiety disorder are not delusional and can consider the possibility that they are not seriously ill. Thus, the beliefs about health that occur in illness anxiety disorder do not rise to the rigid and intense level seen in somatic delusions. In addition, bizarre somatic beliefs that occur in conjunction with other signs of psychosis (eg, hallucinations or disorganized speech and behavior) indicate a psychotic disorder, such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, unipolar major depression with psychotic features, or bipolar disorder with psychotic features. However, it is more difficult to differentiate delusional disorder, somatic type (eg, delusional parasitosis), which is characterized by behavior and functioning that are not markedly strange or impaired, from illness anxiety disorder with poor insight. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-differential-diagnosis-and-initial-management-of-psychosis-in-adults#H261969404\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, differential diagnosis, and initial management of psychosis in adults&quot;, section on 'Primary psychiatric illnesses'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Unipolar major depression or persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia)</strong> &ndash; Depressed patients may ruminate over physical health and have difficulty accepting reassurance, but they also suffer other symptoms (eg, insomnia, anorexia, anergia, impaired memory and concentration, and suicidality) that are generally not seen in illness anxiety disorder. A separate diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder is not made if health concerns arise only during depressive episodes. However, if excessive health anxiety persists after remission of a depressive episode and other criteria for illness anxiety disorder are met, the diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder should be made.

In DSM-5, patients previously diagnosed with hypochondriasis are nearly always diagnosed with either somatic symptom disorder (if physical complaints are prominent) or illness anxiety disorder (if physical complaints are minimal or nonexistent). (See <a href=\"#H44384494\" class=\"local\">'Terminology and DSM-5'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The estimated 6- to 12-month prevalence of illness anxiety disorder among general medical outpatients is 0.2 to 1.5 percent. The disorder is thought to occur across the lifespan but is most prevalent in midlife and occurs in both sexes in approximately a one-to-one ratio. (See <a href=\"#H7947228\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathogenesis of illness anxiety disorder is not known. (See <a href=\"#H7947235\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The core feature of illness anxiety disorder is persistent preoccupation with having or developing a serious medical illness despite appropriate medical evaluation and reassurance. Illness anxiety preoccupations are heterogeneous and the degree of insight is variable. The concern about the feared illness often becomes a central feature of the patient&rsquo;s life and can lead to high health care utilization or marked avoidance of mainstream health care. (See <a href=\"#H235454074\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with illness anxiety disorder often have comorbid psychopathology, especially anxiety and depressive disorders. Comorbid personality disorders appear common as well. (See <a href=\"#H86829664\" class=\"local\">'Comorbid psychopathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with possible illness anxiety disorder are evaluated for general medical conditions with a medical history, physical examination, and focused laboratory tests. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=somatic-symptom-disorder-assessment-and-diagnosis#H3356131635\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Somatic symptom disorder: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Assessment'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The psychiatric history and mental status examination should address the patient&rsquo;s fears and beliefs about having a serious general medical illness, history of serious illnesses, current and past medical treatments, the quality of the patient&rsquo;s relationship with current and past primary care clinicians, psychiatric comorbidity, psychosocial functioning, and family history of serious diseases. (See <a href=\"#H362541916\" class=\"local\">'Interview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnostic criteria for illness anxiety disorder are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F104206\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104206 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7947249\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis for illness anxiety disorder includes general medical disorders, as well as psychiatric disorders, such as adjustment disorders, somatic symptom disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, specific phobia, panic disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, psychotic disorders, and depressive disorders. (See <a href=\"#H86829446\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">American Psychiatric Association.
