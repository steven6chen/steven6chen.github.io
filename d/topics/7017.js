Although the mature hemodialysis AV fistula is associated with fewer complications compared with other types of vascular access, when problems occur, they need to be managed effectively. The main causes of failure in a mature hemodialysis AV fistula are vascular stenotic lesions. These lesions manifest as decreased flow leading to inadequate dialysis and eventually thrombosis. </p><p>Failure of the mature AV fistula and management will be reviewed here. Primary failure of the newly created hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula is reviewed separately, as are other types of AV fistula dysfunction, such as hemodialysis ischemic syndrome, aneurysm formation, infection, and excess flow leading to congestive heart failure.

Lesions associated with the mature hemodialysis AV fistulas can include arterial or venous stenosis (preexisting or acquired) and collateral veins. These are described in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-failure-of-the-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula#H60151285\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary failure of the hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula&quot;, section on 'Associated lesions'</a>.)</p><p>Findings on physical examination associated with vascular stenotic lesions or thrombosis are listed briefly below, and these, along with other methods for monitoring and surveillance of fistulas, are discussed in detail elsewhere.

Although either venous or arterial lesions may be seen, venous stenosis is by far the most common. Venous lesions have a predilection for sites characterized by turbulent flow such as bifurcations, venous valves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/7-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-12</a>], and areas that have been referred to as &quot;swing points&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In addition, there are some stenotic lesions that appear to be related to or at least influenced in their clinical manifestations by high blood flow rates, which are more common in patients with an AV fistula. These include central vein stenosis and cephalic arch stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/11,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H508338125\"><span class=\"h2\">Swing-point stenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A swing-point stenosis is a unique point where the course of the vein involved in the AV fistula or its drainage makes an extreme angle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This is seen in the juxta-anastomotic region of the AV fistula, the angle of transposition in a transposed brachial-basilic AV fistula, and at the cephalic arch. </p><p>Flow at these points is nonlaminar and associated with decreased shear stress and oscillatory shear stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. These anomalies result in a cascade of events that result in neointimal hyperplasia causing venous stenosis. Except for the cephalic arch lesion, these swing-point stenoses are unique to the AV fistula. In addition, the frequency of each of the three lesions tends to be specific to an AV fistula type:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Juxta-anastomotic stenosis is seen most frequently in the radial-cephalic AV fistula (although not exclusive to it). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cephalic arch stenosis is seen most commonly with a brachial-cephalic AV fistula.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The angle of transposition lesion is specific for a brachial-basilic AV fistula. </p><p/><p>In a study involving 127 cases with venous stenosis, 46 percent were swing-point lesions. Of these, the most common was juxta-anastomotic stenosis, accounting for 63 percent of that subgroup. Cephalic arch and brachial-basilic angle of transposition lesions accounted for 18 and 19 percent, respectively. Overall, swing-point stenosis was present in 35.4 percent of brachial-cephalic, 33.9 percent of radial-cephalic, and 30.7 percent of brachial-basilic AV fistulas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1565529212\"><span class=\"h3\">Juxta-anastomotic stenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Juxta-anastomotic stenosis is defined as stenosis occurring within the first 3 to 4 cm of the AV fistula, immediately adjacent to the arterial anastomosis. It is the most common type of lesion associated with primary AV fistula failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/7,15-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,15-22</a>] and is also a very common lesion associated with failure of a mature AV fistula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. Three variations of this lesion may be observed: juxta-anastomotic stenosis only, anastomotic stenosis only, and a combination of the two. Since this is an inflow lesion, its primary clinical effect is to reduce access blood flow.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H894934006\"><span class=\"h3\">Brachial-basilic angle of transposition stenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For a brachial-basilic AV fistula to be easily accessible for cannulation once the AV fistula develops, it must be superficialized and transposed laterally. The problem that can lead to venous stenosis relates to the angle of transposition (ie, the angle created when the vein is moved to its optimal position). Since the proximal portion is bound down and the lower and medial parts are being moved superficially and laterally, a distinct angle can be created. This is the point at which stenosis can occur. Transposition stenosis has also been reported with brachial-brachial AV fistula. </p><p>In various series, its frequency has been reported to be relatively high. In one study involving 93 cases of transposed brachiobasilic AV fistulas, significant venous stenosis was present in 54 percent. Of these, 74 percent were at the angle of transposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In another series, which included 10 cases of transposed brachial-brachial and 19 of transposed brachial-basilic AV fistulas, stenosis occurred in 42 and 49 percent of the cases, respectively. One-half of the brachial-brachial cases and most of the brachial-basilic cases were swing-point stenoses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H73360338\"><span class=\"h3\">Cephalic arch</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cephalic arch is a unique vascular structure, anatomically and hemodynamically, and a particularly problematic area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/10,23,28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,23,28-30</a>]. In the upper arm, the cephalic vein lies in the deltopectoral groove where, just below the clavicle, it turns to run deeper to empty into the axillary vein. This creates an angle of insertion approaching 90 degrees and referred to as the cephalic arch. At this point, it passes through the clavipectoral fascia. This is a dense membrane occupying the interval between the pectoralis minor and the subclavian vessels. In addition to the cephalic vein, it is also pierced by the thoracoacromial artery and vein and lateral pectoral nerve. In addition to having the swing-point anatomical configuration, this unique anatomy tends to interfere with the dilatation of the vein in response to the increased flow associated with vascular access drainage. </p><p>Stenosis at the cephalic arch has been reported in 15 to 18 percent of cases of mature AV fistula failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. This problem is more commonly seen with brachial-cephalic AV fistulas than with radial-cephalic AV fistulas (39 versus 2 percent in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. This difference has been attributed to differences in flow through the cephalic arch with these two types of access. A radial-cephalic AV fistula has less flow through the cephalic arch with the dual outflow drainage offered by both the basilic and cephalic veins in addition to the fact that this access tends to have a lower flow rate than does an upper arm AV fistula. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1663582904\"><span class=\"h2\">Central vein stenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The true incidence of central vein stenosis is not totally clear since only symptomatic cases are generally recognized, and available evidence suggests that many cases are not symptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The incidence varies considerably depending upon local practice patterns, primarily with regard to the use of central venous catheters. Central vein lesions can occur anywhere within the central veins. The most common location in one study was the subclavian-cephalic arch junction (38 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. This was followed by the brachiocephalic veins (29 percent), the subclavian vein only (24 percent), and the superior vena cava (9 percent). The development of these lesions and their recurrence are promoted by high AV access blood flows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13</a>]. </p><p>A significant number of central vein stenotic lesions occur at the junction of the first rib and the clavicle, at the costoclavicular junction. Many of these are related at least in part to external compression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. The subclavian vein is vulnerable as it passes next to the intersection of the clavicle and first rib. These costoclavicular junction compression lesions can be extremely problematic. On angiography, the presence of a lesion in this location should raise the suspicion that this is the problem.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H882679\"><span class=\"h2\">Arterial stenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arterial stenosis is a much less common cause of AV fistula failure compared with venous stenosis. In a report dealing with a cohort of 101 dysfunctional AV fistula cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], 8 percent were found to have lesions in the feeding artery, and 21 percent had stenosis of the arterial anastomosis. There was a higher incidence of inflow stenosis for forearm as compared with upper arm AV fistulas.<strong> </strong>Others have reported the incidence of arterial stenosis in these cases at 6 to 18 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/30,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,36</a>]. These lesions result in decreased blood flow in the access leading to inadequate dialysis and increased risk for thrombosis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2178608781\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of vascular stenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prospective treatment of physiologically significant stenosis before thrombosis can occur and will materially prolong access survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Percutaneous angioplasty has come to be the treatment of choice for these lesions and has a greater than 95 percent technical success rate. Long-term primary patency rates are reported in the range of 92 percent at three months, 57 to 77 percent at six months, and 35 to 69 percent at one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/24,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,37</a>]. The treatment of venous stenosis in AV fistulas presents no unique problems when compared with lesions seen in association with AV grafts. The treatment of vascular stenosis and associated complications are reviewed separately.

In general, 100 percent of all thrombosed AV fistulas have associated pathological anatomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Any of the lesions described above can be seen in association with fistula thrombosis. An AV fistula will thrombose much later in the progression of a stenotic lesion that results in reduced blood flow compared with the AV graft. The lesion has longer to develop and therefore is often much more severe compared with thrombosis-associated AV graft lesions. In addition, an AV fistula generally develops collaterals that allow for a continued blood flow even after the lesion in the main body of the AV fistula has become totally occlusive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>The amount of thrombus present in a thrombosed AV fistula varies considerably [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. At one extreme, stenosis within an AV fistula can progress to the point that blood flow is so diminished that it is no longer detectable. This situation may be diagnosed clinically as a thrombosis even though no thrombus is found when the access is imaged. At the other extreme is the large aneurysmal AV fistula that contains a very large volume of thrombus.</p><p>The thrombus associated with an AV fistula is mildly inflammatory. As it reacts with the wall of the AV fistula, it becomes attached and begins to organize [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. This can complicate efforts directed toward treatment and removal of the thrombus. It is also pertinent in considering how long one can wait to treat a thrombosed AV fistula. The more quickly thrombectomy can be performed, the better. Nevertheless, one should not hesitate to at least evaluate a thrombosed AV fistula no matter how long it has been nonfunctional, especially if a pulse or thrill is present. It may be possible to salvage the access by using one of the larger collaterals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H748999858\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of thrombosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of techniques have been used to treat the thrombosed AV fistula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/30,38,41-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,38,41-46</a>] with no obvious best choice. It is important to adapt the technique used to the situation found when the thrombosed AV fistula is evaluated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p>Reported initial success for the endovascular treatment of thrombosed AV fistulas has ranged from 88 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/24,41-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,41-45</a>]. Primary patency rates ranging from 20 to 56 percent at six months and 27 to 40 percent at one year have been reported. Secondary patency rates of 54 to 83 percent and 51 to 80 percent have been documented for six months and one year, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/38,42,43,46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,42,43,46,47</a>]. </p><p>Some investigators have advocated surgical therapy for the thrombosed AV fistula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/36,48-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,48-52</a>]. Success rates ranging from 70 to 90 percent have been documented using this approach. Primary patency rates ranging from 51 to 84 percent at six months and in the range of 75 percent at one year have been reported. Secondary patency rates of 69 to 88 percent and in the range of 77 percent have been documented for six months and one year, respectively. When these data are compared with that obtained with endovascular therapy, it is apparent that no significant differences exist between these two modalities. </p><p>Not infrequently, an AV fistula thrombectomy is complicated by the presence of old, partially organized adherent thrombus, especially in areas of aneurysmal dilatation. The thrombus may be very resistant to removal but can be approached using a hybrid technique, which has been shown to be very effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-54</a>].

Regardless of the approach to the salvage of a thrombosed AV fistula, long-term patency postintervention is reduced in comparison to an AV fistula that has prospective treatment of a vascular lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H323527900\"><span class=\"h3\">Contraindications to attempted salvage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are absolute and relative contraindications to the salvage of thrombosed AV fistulas, some of which are more absolute for endovascular techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/38,57-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,57-62</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3594108324\"><span class=\"h4\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infection is not seen with AV fistulas with the same frequency as for synthetic grafts.

In another study of 239 patients over a seven-year period, 148 bacteremic episodes occurred in 102 patients with an overall rate of 0.52 per 1000 patient-days. The rate for AV fistulas was 0.18 per 1000 patient-days in contrast to 0.39 per 1000 patient days for AV grafts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. </p><p>These data offer an indication of the frequency of infection associated with an AV fistula; however, they do not indicate the frequency of infection associated with thrombosis, which is not a common occurrence. When it does occur, its presentation is very similar to that of a vasculitis. The thrombus will contain a variable amount of infectious material, which will be released into the circulation if endovascular thrombectomy is attempted. This can lead to serious complications, including septic shock.

With time, the thrombus becomes completely organized. While attempting salvage on such a case is not an absolute contraindication, clinical judgment should be used in attempting salvage. There are two features that can contribute to success: the amount of thrombus that was present when patency was lost, and the fact that there is a tendency for collaterals to form as patency is lost. These can be evaluated with ultrasound. If this evaluation reveals the presence of anatomy that could be used to reestablish a usable conduit, an attempt at salvage should be made. No AV fistula should be abandoned without first making such an evaluation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3573834810\"><span class=\"h4\">Excess thrombus burden</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The amount of thrombus, when it is present, is variable. However, in some cases, the thrombus load can be very large. This is more likely with an upper arm AV fistula, an AV fistula associated with a central vein stenosis, and for large dilated aneurysmal AV fistulas referred to as a &quot;mega-fistula.&quot; Some of these can have over 200 mL of thrombus. Additionally, thrombus of several different ages is frequently present. Some of this may even be partially organized. These fistulas can be treated, but it is time-consuming and associated with a significant risk for pulmonary embolism. In some cases, salvage of such an AV fistula is not warranted. If treatment is elected, a surgical approach is recommended. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1887604896\"><span class=\"h3\">Complications of thrombectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since thrombectomy generally involves an angioplasty as part of the combined procedure, angioplasty-associated complications are also seen here. In addition, the major complication encountered is the occurrence of arterial emboli. Arterial embolization of thrombus fragments associated with thrombectomy performed using any technique is not uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/60,61,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61,63</a>]. These are generally small and asymptomatic and therefore frequently unrecognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/60,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,68</a>]. </p><p>What is generally reported is symptomatic emboli. The reported incidence of symptomatic arterial embolization following thrombectomy in general has been in the range of 0 and 9.3 percent of total cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>]. The incidence of this complication is significantly higher with an AV graft compared with an AV fistula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Since the wall of the AV fistula is native vessel and the thrombus is mildly inflammatory, it adheres to the wall and begins the process of organization. This renders it less likely to break loose and embolize during the thrombectomy procedure. In a review of 12,169 AV fistula thrombectomy cases, the incidence of arterial embolization was 0.17 percent (21 cases) in contrast to 0.349 percent, which occurred in 102,737 (358 cases) AV graft thrombectomies.</p><p>The symptoms of embolization are those of hand ischemia. The hand and especially the fingers turn cold and take on a bluish discoloration that becomes mottled. These changes generally come on with the sudden onset of pain. In evaluating a patient's hand for a suspected embolus, it is important to compare it with the opposite hand. If both are cold and mottled, it is not likely that the hand in question reflects an acute problem. The pulses at the wrist are generally absent or considerably diminished, a change that can be appreciated only if the patient was carefully evaluated prior to having the thrombectomy procedure. A Doppler signal is generally present over the arteries at the wrist even when the pulse is not palpable, although it is frequently diminished. If nothing is detected with Doppler examination, the urgency for immediate treatment to avoid tissue damage is even greater than usual. Symptomatic emboli must be treated in a timely fashion in order to prevent permanent sequelae. Treatment should be directed at restoring flow to the ischemic hand as quickly as possible in order to relieve the patient's pain and preserve hand function by avoiding secondary muscle ischemia and necrosis. Outcomes and prognosis largely depend on a rapid diagnosis and initiation of appropriate and effective therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/failure-of-the-mature-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].
