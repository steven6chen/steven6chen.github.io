As a result, patients with MDS are at risk for symptomatic anemia, infection, and bleeding, as well as progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is often refractory to standard treatment.</p><p>The pathobiology of MDS is complex and not fully understood; however, alterations in the function of the bone marrow microenvironment, or niche, as well as the hematopoietic stem cells have been implicated. The development of MDS involves a series of genetic changes in a hematopoietic stem cell. These changes alter normal hematopoietic growth and differentiation, resulting in an accumulation of abnormal, immature myeloid cells in the bone marrow and the impairment of normal hematopoiesis. Advances in the identification of recurring chromosomal abnormalities and gene alterations have provided insight into the pathobiology of MDS.</p><p>Specific cytogenetic abnormalities identified by karyotype analysis or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis have prognostic significance for patients with primary MDS and affect treatment planning. Certain gene mutations also confer prognostic significance in adult patients with MDS, but it is not yet clear how to incorporate these changes into treatment planning. Even those patients without obvious abnormalities detected by karyotypic analysis, FISH, or gene mutation analyses likely have abnormalities in gene expression profiles or have acquired copy number alterations that may help to identify genes important for the pathogenesis of MDS. </p><p>Characteristic chromosomal abnormalities have also been identified in patients who developed MDS or AML (often preceded by MDS) after chemotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation therapy for an earlier disorder, such as Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), or a solid tumor, as well as non-malignant disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, or following organ transplantation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F77909\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77909 \">table 1</a>). This subject is discussed separately.

An overview of cytogenetic abnormalities in hematologic malignancies (including definitions, methods of detection, the genetic consequences of chromosomal translocations) and a more detailed discussion of the prognosis of MDS are presented separately.

Simple chromosome changes may involve a numerical change (ie, monosomy or trisomy), a structural abnormality involving only one chromosome (eg, inversion and interstitial deletion), or, less commonly, a balanced translocation involving two chromosomes. Ten to 15 percent of patients exhibit complex karyotypes with multiple abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics-of-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. Additional chromosomal aberrations may evolve during the course of MDS, or an abnormal clone may emerge in a patient with a previously normal karyotype; these changes appear to portend progression to acute leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics-of-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/4,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,7</a>]. Notably, all of these common chromosome abnormalities observed in MDS are also frequently detected in other myeloid diseases (ie, acute myeloid leukemia and myeloproliferative neoplasms).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H256827820\"><span class=\"h2\">Recurring abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clonal chromosomal abnormalities can be detected in bone marrow cells in approximately 50 percent of patients with primary MDS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F77909\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77909 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics-of-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/1,2,4,8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,4,8-11</a>]. This fraction is somewhat lower than the 70 to 80 percent detected in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) de novo. The likelihood of chromosomal abnormalities is increased in patients with advanced MDS.</p><p>Although rates vary depending upon the technique used and the population studied, the most common chromosomal abnormalities seen in MDS are del(5q), -7 or del(7q), trisomy 8, del(20q), and loss of the Y chromosome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F77909\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77909 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F110233\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110233 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics-of-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. As an example, a series of 1029 patients with MDS seen at two medical centers between 1995 and 2006 reported that an abnormal karyotype was seen in 44 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics-of-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The most common abnormalities were a complex karyotype, del(5q), trisomy 8, and del(20q), which were present in 18, 6, 4, and 3 percent, respectively. Loss of the Y chromosome is common in men, particularly older men, without hematologic disorders and is not thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of MDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics-of-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>There are two features that distinguish the cytogenetic changes in primary MDS from those in de novo AML:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although +8, del(5q), <span class=\"nowrap\">-7/del(7q),</span> and del(20q) are common in both disorders, the specific structural rearrangements (balanced translocations) that are closely associated with distinct subsets of de novo AML are not commonly seen in MDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics-of-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/1,2,4,6,10,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,4,6,10,13,14</a>]. Exceptions include the t(3;21), <span class=\"nowrap\">inv(3)/t(3;3),</span> and t(11;16), which are observed in primary MDS and in AML with myelodysplastic features, as well as in therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN) and in rare cases of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) during accelerated and blast phases.

The identification of an isolated del(5q), or del(5q) plus one other abnormality with the exception of <span class=\"nowrap\">-7/del(7q),</span> is used in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification system of MDS to define the 5q- syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F110233\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110233 \">table 2</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H256821606\" class=\"local\">'5q- syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>5q31.2 &ndash; Deletion of this locus is more commonly seen with high risk MDS or therapy-related MDS and is associated with a complex karyotype, <em>TP53</em> loss or mutation, and more aggressive disease.</p><p/><p>In each case, these deletions occur on a single chromosome resulting in a heterozygous (haploinsufficient) state with retention of one normal allele of all of the genes contained within the deleted segment. As yet, mutations in the non-deleted alleles have not been detected by gene sequencing nor have cases of acquired uniparental disomy (also known as copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity) of 5q been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics-of-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. Uniparental disomy ordinarily is a genetic phenomenon that occurs during early embryogenesis where a mitotic recombination event results in homozygosity of both copies of a chromosome or chromosome segment. In contrast, acquired uniparental disomy occurs as a result of a mitotic recombination event in a hematopoietic stem or progenitor cell resulting in homozygosity of a chromosome or chromosome segment, followed by clonal hematopoiesis. Because most patients have very large deletions, these regions are not exclusive and most cases will have a deletion that spans both regions. In addition, del(5q) is commonly accompanied by other chromosomal abnormalities.</p><p>The long arm of chromosome 5 contains numerous genes that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of MDS <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sensitization to specific therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics-of-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Gene expression profiling, knock-down experiments using RNA interference, and forced expression studies have implicated the RPS14 protein, required for the maturation of 40S ribosomal subunits, in the genesis of the 5q- syndrome, particularly in abnormalities of erythropoiesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics-of-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>]. Of interest, the ribosomal processing defect caused by haploinsufficiency of RPS14 in the 5q- syndrome is highly analogous to the functional ribosomal defect seen in Diamond-Blackfan anemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-in-children-due-to-decreased-red-blood-cell-production#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anemia in children due to decreased red blood cell production&quot;, section on 'Diamond-Blackfan anemia'</a>.)</p><p>Studies have shown that haploinsufficiency of two micro-RNAs (miRNAs) that are abundant in hematopoietic <span class=\"nowrap\">stem/progenitor</span> cells (HSPCs), <em>miR-145 </em>and <em>miR-146a</em>, are encoded by sequences near the <em>RPS14</em> gene, and cooperate with loss of RPS14. The Toll-interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor protein (<em>TIRAP</em>) and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor-6 (<em>TRAF6</em>) are respective targets of these miRNAs, implicating inappropriate activation of innate immune signals in the pathogenesis of the 5q- syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics-of-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Studies in a mouse model suggest that a Tp53-dependent mechanism underlies this syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics-of-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>], perhaps due to activation of the innate immune system and induction of <em>S100A8-S100A9</em> expression, leading to a Tp53-dependent erythroid differentiation defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics-of-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. In one report, the low expression of <em>RPS14</em> in 23 patients with the 5q- syndrome was not due to promoter hypermethylation, suggesting that the use of hypomethylating agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azacitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azacitidine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=decitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">decitabine</a>) is unlikely to benefit this MDS variant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics-of-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Animal studies and retrospective analyses have implicated loss of the CSNK1A1 gene within the deleted 5q region in the development of the 5q- syndrome. <em>CSNK1A1</em> encodes casein kinase 1A, a component of the APC destruction complex that regulates WNT signaling via degradation of beta-catenin (CTNNB1). In a mouse knockout and transplantation study, heterozygous deletion of <em>CSNK1A1</em> led to a proliferative advantage for hematopoietic stem cell and progenitor cells, and <em>CTNNB1</em> activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics-of-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. <em>TP53</em> activation was also observed in mice with homozygous deletions of <em>CSNK1A1</em>. In a retrospective study, mutations in <em>CSNK1A1</em> were detected in seven of 39 patients with MDS and del(5q) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics-of-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. These missense mutations are associated with disease progression and poor response to treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a>. In some patients, mutations in CSNK1A1 coexist with <em>TP53</em> mutations, implicating cooperation of these genes in the pathogenesis of MDS with a del(5q). Of interest, lenalidomide induces the ubiquitination of CSNK1A1 by the E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4 (CRBN), resulting in CSNK1A1 degradation and subsequent upregulation of the WNT pathway; haploinsufficient loss of <em>CSNK1A1</em> sensitizes cells to lenalidomide therapy, providing a mechanistic basis for the therapeutic window of lenalidomide in del(5q) MDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics-of-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p>Other genes located on 5q that are deleted in MDS, AML, or therapy-related <span class=\"nowrap\">MDS/AML</span> with a del(5q) include <em>EGR1</em> and <em>APC</em>. Loss of function of Apc (adenomatosis polyposis coli gene, <em>APC</em> tumor suppressor gene) in animal models results in MDS with dyserythropoiesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics-of-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. Loss of function of <em>EGR1</em> cooperates with mutations induced by alkylating agents to induce myeloid neoplasms in mouse models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics-of-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. These results provide support for the current model that the haploinsufficient loss of multiple genes on 5q cooperate in the pathogenesis of myeloid disorders with a del(5q). In this regard, a report demonstrated that haploinsufficiency for both <em>Egr1 </em>and<em> Apc</em> on 5q, together with knockdown of <em>Tp53</em>, in bone marrow cells induces AML in a mouse model, illustrating the cooperativity of these three genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics-of-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Cases of MDS where del(5q) is the sole chromosomal abnormality have a relatively good prognosis and good chance of responding to treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F96321\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96321 \">table 3</a>). In comparison, monosomy 5 (now known to result from structural rearrangements of chromosome 5, rather than actual chromosome loss) or del(5q) with other chromosomal changes is associated with advanced MDS and a worse outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics-of-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

Some of these are discussed below. These gene mutations have been found to affect epigenetic regulation, including DNA methylation and histone modification, RNA-splicing machinery, transcription factors, and cytokine signaling pathways. Many of these mutations are driver mutations in MDS, and have independent prognostic significance (<em>TP53, EZH2, ETV6, RUNX1</em>, and <em>ASXL1</em>) and are associated with progression to AML [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics-of-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Thus, many of these gene mutations are even more frequent in AML, particularly in AML with a normal karyotype, and they provide insight into the pathobiology of MDS and its progression to AML. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia&quot;, section on 'Gene mutations'</a>.)</p><p>In a targeted sequencing study of 111 oncogenic genes, gene mutations were detected in 43 genes in 549 (74 percent) of 738 patients, including 80 percent of patients with MDS and 20 percent of those with CMML or <span class=\"nowrap\">MDS/MPN</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics-of-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].

Similarly, in a study of 944 patients with MDS that used targeted deep-sequencing to identify gene mutations from a total of 104 genes, at least one mutation was identified in 90 percent of patients with a median of three mutated genes per sample [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics-of-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].

Mutations were most commonly seen in genes involved in mRNA splicing, DNA methylation, chromatin modification, and transcription. The number and pattern of genes mutated differs among the MDS subtypes, with the majority of common mutations identified more frequently in high risk MDS subtypes than in low risk MDS subtypes. Notably, the hierarchies of these multiple gene mutations in MDS change dramatically during treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a> and become more complex with rapid overgrowth of the founder clone, subclones, or even fully independent clones, which is often accompanied by disease progression and treatment failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics-of-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. &#160; </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><em>TET2</em></strong> &ndash; DNA methylation is a prognostic marker and predictor of response to therapy among patients with MDS and appears to be a mechanism of disease progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics-of-myelodysplastic-syndromes/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>]. In addition, DNA hypomethylating agents that inhibit DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) have demonstrated activity in MDS and have become a key component of the initial therapy of many patients with MDS.

Although rates vary depending upon the technique used and the population studied, the most common chromosomal abnormalities seen in MDS are del(5q), -7 or del(7q), trisomy 8, del(20q), and loss of the Y chromosome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F77909\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77909 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F110233\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110233 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H256827820\" class=\"local\">'Recurring abnormalities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of MDS is usually made based upon an evaluation of the bone marrow and peripheral smear in the appropriate clinical context. Certain cytogenetic abnormalities are sufficient for the diagnosis of MDS in patients with otherwise unexplained refractory cytopenia and no morphologic evidence of dysplasia. Similarly, there are cytogenetic abnormalities that result in the diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia rather than MDS, regardless of blast count. (See <a href=\"#H256827544\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The 5q- syndrome is a distinctive type of MDS that is defined in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F110233\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110233 \">table 2</a>) by isolated del(5q) or del(5q) plus one other abnormality (with the exception of <span class=\"nowrap\">-7/del(7q))</span>. The 5q- syndrome has a relatively good prognosis and good chance of responding to treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a>. In comparison, del(5q) or structural rearrangements of 5q with &gt;1 additional chromosomal change is associated with advanced MDS and a worse prognosis.

Specific chromosomal abnormalities are incorporated into prognostic scoring systems for MDS (eg, the original and revised International Prognostic Scoring Systems (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F85832\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85832 \">table 4</a>), the WHO Prognostic Scoring System, the MD Anderson Cancer Center MDS model).
