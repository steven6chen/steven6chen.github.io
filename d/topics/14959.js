Although there is a rapid rise in exercise capacity that occurs at approximately two months post-transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rehabilitation-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], and many patients return to their normal activities with improved quality of life, exercise function remains 30 to 40 percent below normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rehabilitation-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Unfortunately in the United States, participation in cardiac rehabilitation is low and varies by region and yet could reduce readmissions. This observation in 2531 post-transplant patients associating participation in cardiac rehabilitation with a lower one-year readmission for Medicare beneficiaries adds a significant layer of benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rehabilitation-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>Prior studies describing persistently abnormal exercise capacity in the early post-transplant period suggested several possible explanations, including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rehabilitation-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Marked deconditioning prior to transplant due to heart failure (HF) or due to extended mechanical assistance with a left ventricular assist device.

A more general discussion of cardiac rehabilitation and exercise capacity in patients with HF is presented separately.

A systematic review included 10 randomized controlled trials comparing exercise-based rehabilitation (early or late after cardiac transplantation) with no exercise (nine trials) or a different intensity of exercise training (one trial) with a total of 300 participants with median follow-up of 12 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rehabilitation-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Moderate-quality evidence from nine trials showed that exercise-based rehabilitation increased exercise capacity compared with no exercise control (mean difference in VO<sub>2peak</sub> 2.49 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/min,</span> 95% CI 1.63-3.36). One trial found that high-intensity interval exercise training was more effective than continuous moderate-intensity exercise in improving exercise capacity (mean difference 2.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/min,</span> 95% CI 0.59-4.01). Four studies studied effect on HRQoL using differing outcomes and methods of reporting; there was no evidence of difference between exercise-based rehabilitation and no exercise in 18 of 21 HRQoL domains reported or between high- and moderate-intensity exercise in any of 10 HRQoL domains reported.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Early</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4286206089\"><span class=\"h3\">Exercise capacity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early after transplantation, most patients have a notable improvement in functional capacity compared with their preoperative condition, although exercise capacity usually remains below normal. </p><p>Pretransplant conditioning varies among cardiac transplant recipients. Some cardiac transplant recipients may have already participated in cardiac rehabilitation programs and thus will be more experienced and perhaps better conditioned. On the other hand, patients who have been very ill prior to transplantation may be severely deconditioned and may not see an improvement in functional capacity early after transplantation. More patients are coming to transplant after a period of mechanical assistance. In 2013, the number of left ventricular assist devices implanted as bridges to transplant exceeded the number of transplants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rehabilitation-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Patients receiving mechanical circulatory support are at risk for complications that may result in hospitalizations and more deconditioning. After transplant, these patients are at risk for additional complications, which may lead to further deconditioning prior to initiation of rehabilitation.</p><p>Factors that may limit exercise capacity post-transplant include chronotropic incompetence due to denervation of the heart, left <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> right ventricular systolic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diastolic dysfunction, impaired peripheral vascular function, and skeletal muscle derangements. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-capacity-and-vo2-in-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise capacity and VO2 in heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1728191796\"><span class=\"h3\">Effect of early rehabilitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The importance of early cardiac rehabilitation was illustrated in a study that randomized 27 patients within two weeks of cardiac transplantation to a six-month structured rehabilitation program or unstructured therapy at home. Compared with the control group, the exercise group had a greater increase in peak oxygen consumption (49 versus 18 percent) and workload (59 versus 18 percent) and a greater reduction in the ventilatory equivalent for carbon dioxide (20 versus 11 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rehabilitation-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>In experienced transplant centers, patients are enrolled in cardiac rehabilitation within two weeks of transplant with improvements in peak Vo<sub>2</sub> and six-minute walk. However, a relationship between early rehabilitation and long-term outcomes has not been firmly established. A retrospective single-center review of 201 patients who received a cardiac transplant found that among the factors predicting survival post-transplant were the number of cardiac rehabilitation sessions attended in the first 90 days after surgery controlling for post-transplant six-minute walk and rejection episodes. Each rehabilitation session attended corresponded to a 10 percent decrease in risk of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rehabilitation-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Long-term</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2991132118\"><span class=\"h3\">Exercise capacity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Functional capacity can decrease naturally with age, and an age-dependent decline in peak Vo<sub>2</sub> has been noted in normal subjects. This decline can be exacerbated in cardiac transplantation patients due to a number of factors including chronic immunosuppressive therapy, particularly corticosteroids, which impair proximal muscle strength. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucocorticoid-induced-myopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glucocorticoid-induced myopathy&quot;</a>.) A review of over 1800 patients demonstrated that Vo<sub>2</sub> tends to increase after the first year after cardiac transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rehabilitation-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Among the best data on long-term exercise capacity is a study of 140 patients who underwent repeated treadmill exercise testing up to nine years after heart transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rehabilitation-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In the group as a whole, peak Vo<sub>2</sub> increased from 14.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/min</span> pretransplant to 21.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/min</span> 11 months after the transplant. When compared with the normal population, peak Vo<sub>2</sub> was less than 50 percent predicted in 12 percent of patients, 50 to 70 percent predicted in 44 percent, 70 to 90 percent predicted in 31 percent, and greater than 90 percent in only 13 percent. In contrast to the above report, the improvement seen by six months did not change significantly over nine years of follow-up.</p><p>A number of factors may contribute to the persistently low exercise capacity in most heart transplant recipients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise capacity may be lower in recipients who are on maintenance corticosteroid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rehabilitation-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucocorticoid-induced-myopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glucocorticoid-induced myopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The heart rate response to exercise remains subnormal up to five years after transplant, suggesting that there is no functionally significant cardiac reinnervation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rehabilitation-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with chronic heart failure (HF) have skeletal muscle histologic abnormalities with an increase in type II (fast twitch) muscle fibers relative to type I (slower twitch) fibers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skeletal-muscle-dysfunction-and-exercise-intolerance-in-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skeletal muscle dysfunction and exercise intolerance in heart failure&quot;</a>.) After transplant, the ratio of both fiber types remains unchanged, but a significant increase in fiber size occurs in association with an elevation in skeletal muscle oxidative capacity. Thus, although some of the skeletal muscle abnormalities improve after transplantation, complete normalization does not occur.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurohormonal abnormalities associated with HF do not normalize rapidly after transplantation and may contribute to persistent post-transplant vasoconstriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rehabilitation-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data obtained five years post-transplant show that the peak Vo<sub>2</sub> decreases with time in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rehabilitation-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, if measured as an absolute value rather than normalized to body weight, Vo<sub>2</sub> <span class=\"nowrap\">(mL/min)</span> remains unchanged, suggesting that weight gain impacts negatively on exercise performance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise response in transplant recipients may be limited by reduced preload and heart rate reserve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rehabilitation-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Transplant recipients generated reduced peak cardiac index due to lower peak heart rate and lower peak end-diastolic volume index as compared with donor age-matched controls. During sustained exercise, end-diastolic volume index and cardiac index were lower in transplant recipients than in controls.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Effect of later rehabilitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiac rehabilitation can be of value several years after transplantation. This was illustrated in a series of 21 patients who were five years post-transplant and not engaging in routine physical activity who were enrolled in a training program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rehabilitation-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Endurance exercise capacity increased by 18 and 35 percent at three months and one year, respectively. The increases in exercise and peak Vo<sub>2</sub> were related to improved aerobic metabolism, rather than improved cardiac performance. Maximum heart rate and stroke volume remained constant, as has been shown in other studies. Early in training, 50 percent of the improvement was due to better skeletal muscle conditioning and the remainder due to increased central responses.</p><p>Improvements in exercise capacity post-transplant do not seem to be related to ventricular function or to changes in endothelial function. In a trial performed a mean of five years post-transplantation, 43 patients were randomly assigned to a supervised strength and aerobic training program or no training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rehabilitation-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Peak Vo<sub>2</sub>, total lean mass, and strength improved significantly more in the trained group, although submaximal exercise left ventricular systolic function and brachial artery endothelial-dependent or &ndash;independent vasodilation were not significantly improved. Thus, physical conditioning should still be encouraged years after transplantation.</p><p>The ultimate results of an exercise program depend in part upon the motivation of the individual. In one study, for example, patients underwent a 16-month program at the end of which there was a significant improvement in Vo<sub>2</sub> in the more compliant patients (32.2 versus 21.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/min</span> at baseline) but no significant change in the less compliant patients (24.5 versus 21.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/min</span> at baseline) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rehabilitation-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The overall exercise capacity of the combined group was 70 percent of normal. Nevertheless, the amount of work achieved in both groups increased, as did the peak double product achieved at similar effort levels, measured by the respiratory exchange ratio (RER = Vco<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/Vo<sub>2</sub>)</span> and Borg effort level (ie, the rate of perceived exertion) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70470\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70470 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rehabilitation-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-rehabilitation-programs#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac rehabilitation programs&quot;, section on 'Rating of perceived exertion (Borg scale)'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3475540918\"><span class=\"h1\">TIMING OF CARDIAC REHABILITATION REFERRAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The available evidence supports early referral for outpatient cardiac rehabilitation following cardiac transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rehabilitation-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Although there is limited information on the optimum time after cardiac transplantation to refer for cardiac rehabilitation, there are data showing benefits from early referral to a cardiac rehabilitation program. Earlier referral may lead to lower percent body fat, waist circumference, and body mass indices. Obesity is linked to diabetes mellitus in all patient populations, and obesity and diabetes are associated with increased risk in patients receiving post-transplant medical therapy. In addition, patients with diabetes are less likely to remain adherent to cardiac rehabilitation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">THE TRANSPLANT CARDIAC REHABILITATION PROGRAM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who have undergone cardiac transplantation pose a challenge to the cardiac rehabilitation team. Many of these patients have been repeatedly hospitalized for prolonged periods of time, leading to marked deconditioning; they are also often cachectic and malnourished due to prior congestive heart failure (HF).</p><p>Cardiac transplantation offers these patients a new source of central cardiovascular blood flow. For the reasons noted above, the likelihood of restoring exercise capacity is increased with adherence to a cardiac rehabilitation program. Due to persistent sinus node denervation, the heart rate cannot be used as a measure of work intensity; as a result, the rehabilitation team must rely on clinical judgment and the rating of perceived exertion (RPE or Borg scale) to guide exercise therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70470\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70470 \">table 1</a>). Alternatively, an empiric workload intensity level can be prescribed, as long as it is accompanied by a plan of progression to higher intensity levels over time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Pretransplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ideally, cardiac transplant candidates should initiate an exercise program as soon as possible after transplant listing and prior to transplant. The program should include both aerobic training as well as resistive exercise. Aerobic training is safe in patients with HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rehabilitation-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>]. Resistive training is not as well studied in this population. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-rehabilitation-in-patients-with-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac rehabilitation in patients with heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If the program is instituted pretransplantation, the patient will be familiar with exercise modes such as range of motion and will be able to reinitiate these with minimal re-education shortly after transplantation. Furthermore, if the patient is in a better conditioned state pretransplant, the few days of intubation and inactivity after transplant will do little to reverse this level of conditioning.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For stable outpatients, we recommend exercise as an adjunct to pharmacologic therapy during the entire waiting period. The Agency for Health Care Policy and Research Guidelines on Cardiac Rehabilitation recommend exercise training both prior to and after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rehabilitation-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] as does the Exercise and Heart Failure Statement by the American Heart Association and the Scientific Statement on Cardiac Rehabilitation and Secondary Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rehabilitation-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/23,26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,26-28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The 2010 Performance Measures for Cardiac Rehabilitation include cardiac transplantation in its A1 inpatient measure for referral. The preferred timing of referral is during the hospital stay for the transplant event. The document also includes an A2 referral for rehabilitation in the outpatient setting for those not referred earlier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rehabilitation-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients on home inotropic therapy, a monitored program in a cardiac rehabilitation center seems prudent, since inotropes can stimulate or worsen arrhythmias.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For those patients who become dependent upon inotropic support therapy and are hospitalized, the same type of program can be instituted in the hospital. A set routine consisting of bicycle, treadmill, upper body ergometry, and free weights can be carried out safely in the controlled intensive care setting. Walking can often dissipate boredom and will add to the patient's functional capacity. The exercise intensity may need to be determined by patient symptoms, rather than by heart rate or RPE.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients on inotropic support who are being monitored hemodynamically (usually with pulmonary artery catheterization), activity will vary depending upon patient mobility. Certainly, range of motion and leg movement exercises can be performed at the bedside. The addition of incentive spirometry will assure that the ventilatory muscles remain active and trained.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limited data suggest that exercise training may be beneficial in patients who receive a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) as a bridge to transplantation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intermediate-and-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intermediate- and long-term mechanical circulatory support&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p>A retrospective study of 41 patients receiving LVAD support found that exercise training was effective in increasing exercise capacity and safe with one training-related adverse event (non-sustained ventricular tachycardia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rehabilitation-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The left ventricle and LVAD work in parallel with the left ventricle actively contributing to the systemic circulation directly through ejection across the aortic valve and indirectly through LVAD filling. American Heart Association (AHA) statements on cardiac rehabilitation acknowledge that further work is needed since the effect of exercise training in patients receiving mechanical circulatory support is not clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rehabilitation-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. With the growing role of ventricular assist devices, particularly those with continuous flow, the physiology and rehabilitation of those patients needs to be readdressed. In addition, as LVAD implantation is increasing as a bridge to a decision, particularly in older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rehabilitation-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], testing for frailty indices may be advisable and better inform a rehabilitation plan prior to transplantation. Both early and late mobilization may improve quality of life in this growing population that may be very limited in their functional capacity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rehabilitation-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. A survey revealed a variety of approaches to exercise training for LVAD-supported patients, often including inspiratory muscle training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rehabilitation-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Immediate post-transplantation rehabilitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A series of sequential steps should be initiated in the immediate post-transplant period:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to removal of the chest tubes and pacer wires, exercise consists mainly of passive and active range of motion accompanied by incentive spirometry to facilitate pulmonary toilet.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once out of bed in a chair, leg raising and hip girdle exercises become useful as a preparation to transfer weight from sitting to standing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the patient is able to stand, ambulation is initiated, initially in the patient room, progressing to the ward. It is assumed at this point that the patient is on telemetry monitoring. Intensity continues to be assessed by rate of perceived exertion, more commonly using the RPE (Borg) scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70470\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70470 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rehabilitation-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to discharge, if no allograft rejection occurs, the patient may be able to exercise on a stationary bicycle ergometer <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> treadmill. It is our preference to perform a predischarge cardiopulmonary exercise test to better define an exercise prescription for an outpatient program. The rehabilitation team should not be surprised to find a peak Vo<sub>2</sub> that is very similar to the value pretransplantation due to the deconditioned peripheral musculoskeletal system.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Myopathy and resistance training</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proximal muscle weakness is common in post-transplant patients for a number of reasons, including chronic corticosteroid use and the skeletal muscle changes associated with long-standing HF. The value of resistance training was suggested by a randomized controlled trial with eight patients in the training group and eight in the control group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rehabilitation-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Training began two months after surgery to allow sternal healing. The program included both upper and lower body exercises using a set of variable resistance equipment twice weekly for six months. A set consisted of 10 to 15 repetitions at 50 percent of one repetition maximum. After 15 repetitions were successful, the resistance was gradually increased but not to exceed 15 repetitions. The program had no complications.</p><p>Among patients randomized to resistance training, skeletal muscle fibers shifted from the less oxidative type II to the more fatigue-resistant type I. In contrast, patients in the control group who participated in largely aerobic activity had a further loss of type I fibers and an increase in type II. In addition, resistance training produced greater increases in oxidative and glycolytic skeletal muscle enzymes than aerobic training alone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Posthospital exercise prescription</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The exercise prescription post-transplantation includes all the essentials of intensity, duration, frequency, and progression. These issues will be reviewed briefly here and are described in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-rehabilitation-programs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac rehabilitation programs&quot;</a>.) Patients receiving rehabilitation programs should also be given specific exercise modalities, such as resistance training after the first six weeks post-transplantation, the time required to permit healing of the sternal incision.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intensity &ndash; The RPE at the anaerobic threshold is used to prescribe intensity since the heart rate will not be commensurate to the effort because of cardiac denervation. The anaerobic threshold or ventilatory threshold correlates with the lactate threshold in transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rehabilitation-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Alternatively, an empiric workload intensity level can be prescribed, as long as it is accompanied by a plan of progression to higher intensity levels over time. Reports of long-term effects of training suggest that intermittent periods of high intensity may be necessary to maintain function across the post-transplant years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rehabilitation-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. High intensity is defined as warm-up followed by one to four minutes of Borg scale 16 to 18, repeated at intervals of two to four. Each set is followed by an active break, which can consist of walking.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duration &ndash; Warm-up and cool-down is essential with a minimum of 20 minutes at the prescribed intensity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frequency &ndash; Exercise should be performed in a supervised setting three times per week for a minimum of six to eight weeks. Some programs are constructed for a 12-week period. A walking program is recommended for alternate days. An extension of this timetable is often necessary to take into account early episodes of rejection or infection, which may preclude exercise for several days at a time. There are no studies to indicate that electrocardiogram monitoring is required.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progression &ndash; It is important to outline a progressive increase in exercise activity to account for improvement in function, which may occur early in the program. An RPE of 11 to 13 often results in early deconditioning (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70470\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70470 \">table 1</a>). Thus, every effort should be made to increase the intensity to at least RPE 13 to 15 to approach the ventilatory threshold, which may also improve with exercise. If an empiric workload level has been prescribed, a plan of progression to higher intensity levels over time should be incorporated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resistance exercise &ndash; Although less well studied in transplant recipients, resistance exercise can be performed safely and will increase strength and flexibility for tasks of daily living. As noted above, a gradually incremental resistance program can improve fiber type in skeletal muscle, as well as increase oxidative capacity to enhance work. It is recommended, therefore, that a resistance program be added to the aerobic training regimen.</p><p/><p>After the initial program of cardiac rehabilitation is completed, a repeat cardiopulmonary exercise test should be performed in order to update the exercise prescription. Patients should be encouraged to adopt exercise and activity as a way of life. Adherence to physical activity should be monitored in a similar fashion to adherence to the medical regimen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18888990\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early after transplantation, most patients have a notable improvement in functional capacity compared with their preoperative condition, although exercise capacity usually remains below normal. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Early'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The available evidence indicates that exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation improves exercise capacity but does not impact health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in the short term. Long-term improvement in cardiac transplant patients is limited, which may be due to the effects of aging, cardiac denervation, transplant therapy, and prior heart failure. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Exercise capacity and rehabilitation post-transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pretransplantation exercise program is recommended for cardiac transplant candidates to improve patients&rsquo; conditioning and familiarity with physical training protocols, including inspiratory training, in preparation for post-transplantation rehabilitation. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Pretransplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Post-transplantation rehabilitation should begin in the immediate postoperative period if possible and should continue and progress as the patient&rsquo;s condition allows. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'The transplant cardiac rehabilitation program'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The post-hospital exercise prescription includes targets for intensity, duration, frequency, and progression. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Posthospital exercise prescription'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rehabilitation-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Osada N, Chaitman BR, Donohue TJ, et al.
