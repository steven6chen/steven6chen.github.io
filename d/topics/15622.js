It causes fever, cough, and other symptoms. SARS can also cause serious lung problems and even death. There were outbreaks of SARS in 2003 and 2004, mostly in China and other countries in Asia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6662812\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of SARS?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms are different depending on how long it has been since a person was exposed to the virus.</p><p>At first, the symptoms of SARS include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A fever higher than 100.5&ordm;F (38&ordm;C), often with chills, shaking, or both</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling sick, like you have the flu</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle aches</p><p/><p>The first SARS symptoms usually last 3 to 7 days. After that, symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dry cough</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shortness of breath &ndash; People with SARS often feel like they cannot take a deep breath or get enough air. Some people feel like their chest is tight or they have to work harder than usual to breathe.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain when coughing or breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sore throat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Runny nose</p><p/><p>For the first 3 to 7 days of SARS, most people do not have a cough, breathing problems, runny nose, or sore throat even if they have a fever and feel sick.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6662826\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for SARS?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Doctors can test for the virus that causes SARS. Tests include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lab tests on a sample of mucus from your nose</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lab tests on a sample of your bowel movement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p/><p>Your doctor can also do a chest X-ray to look for signs of SARS. If the chest X-ray does not show anything and your doctor still thinks you might have SARS, he or she might do an imaging test called a CT scan. A CT scan creates a sharper image of the inside of your body than an X-ray.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6662841\"><span class=\"h1\">Is SARS dangerous?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It can be. Most people who get SARS need to go to the hospital. Some people even die from it. That's because SARS can cause serious lung damage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6662858\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse right away if there is an outbreak of SARS and:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have trouble breathing.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have a cough with a fever of 100.5&ordm;F (38&ordm;C) or higher, chest pain, or both.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You think you were near someone with SARS, for example, on an airplane or in a country affected by an outbreak.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6662873\"><span class=\"h1\">How is SARS treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with SARS are treated in the hospital, sometimes in the intensive care unit (ICU). Treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines and other treatments to reduce pain, breathing problems, diarrhea, and other symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extra oxygen to help you breathe more easily</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using a ventilator (breathing machine), if you have trouble breathing</p><p/><p>So far, doctors do not have a good medicine to fight the virus that causes SARS. There are medicines called &quot;antiviral&quot; medicines that help fight other viruses, such as the virus that causes the flu. But those antiviral medicines do not work well on SARS. Antibiotics DO NOT WORK on SARS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6662888\"><span class=\"h1\">Can SARS be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can reduce your chances of getting SARS by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NOT going to areas where there is an outbreak of SARS</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NOT eating certain foods (such as meat from unusual animals) if you travel or live in Asia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wearing a mask, hospital gown, and gloves and washing your hands if you are around someone with SARS</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6662903\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=flu-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Flu (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cough-runny-nose-and-the-common-cold-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cough, runny nose, and the common cold (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pneumonia in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bird-flu-avian-influenza-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bird flu (avian influenza) (The Basics)</a> </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=influenza-symptoms-and-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Influenza symptoms and treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-common-cold-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: The common cold in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
