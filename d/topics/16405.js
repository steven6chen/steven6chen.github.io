Straddle injuries usually occur when a child straddles an object as he or she falls, striking the urogenital area with the force of his or her body weight. Injury is caused by the compression of soft tissues against the bony margins of the pelvic outlet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/straddle-injuries-in-children-evaluation-and-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Unintentional blunt straddle injuries typically are unilateral and cause limited contusions or superficial lacerations to the anterior portion of the genitalia in both boys and girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/straddle-injuries-in-children-evaluation-and-management/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Less commonly, children may be impaled by sticks, playground equipment, fence posts, or other similar objects during the fall and sustain a penetrating injury to the genitalia or perineum. These injuries often require surgical repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/straddle-injuries-in-children-evaluation-and-management/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>Straddle injuries are classified as penetrating or blunt.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Blunt</strong> &ndash; Blunt injuries typically cause minor trauma to the external genitalia such as mild scrotal or vulvar hematomas or superficial lacerations or abrasions of the scrotum or penis in boys and of the labia in girls. Serious vaginal, perianal, and testicular trauma rarely result from blunt injuries. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scrotal-trauma-in-children-and-adolescents#H2574559\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Scrotal trauma in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Blunt scrotal trauma'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Penetrating</strong> &ndash; Penetrating injuries are more likely to be serious and extensive than blunt injuries (eg, vaginal-peritoneal perforation, scrotal perforation with testicular injury, urethral disruption, and rectal injury) and more often indicate sexual assault [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/straddle-injuries-in-children-evaluation-and-management/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scrotal-trauma-in-children-and-adolescents#H2574775\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Scrotal trauma in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Penetrating trauma'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unintentional straddle injuries are typically confined to the genitalia and perineum. However, patients with findings of multiple trauma should undergo a primary survey and treatment of life-threatening injuries. Evaluation for genital or perineal injuries is then addressed during the secondary survey. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;, section on 'Initial approach'</a>.)</p><p>The clinician should perform a careful history and physical examination in all children with straddle injuries and obtain a urine specimen. Evaluation should identify patients whose injuries warrant special imaging studies, specialty referral, and findings that suggest child abuse. (See <a href=\"#H626048093\" class=\"local\">'Indications for specialty referral or consultation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H626046110\" class=\"local\">'Findings suggesting child abuse'</a> below and <a href=\"#H722045049\" class=\"local\">'Ancillary studies'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H626046843\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history should identify when and how the straddle injury occurred and what object caused the injury. Commonly described mechanisms include falls onto bicycle frames, playground equipment (eg, monkey bars), fences, edges of bathtubs, and furniture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/straddle-injuries-in-children-evaluation-and-management/abstract/1,2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,4</a>]. The child may be impaled on a variety of objects during these falls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/straddle-injuries-in-children-evaluation-and-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Straddle injuries sustained during motor vehicle collisions are less common but may cause significant trauma to the genitalia and perineum and are more often associated with a pelvic fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/straddle-injuries-in-children-evaluation-and-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The clinician should ask if the patient has been able to urinate since the injury and if hematuria is present. Typical features also include pain and swelling. In patients who report bleeding, the suspected source and amount should be determined. In boys, a history of nausea or vomiting suggests testicular injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scrotal-trauma-in-children-and-adolescents#H16472924\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Scrotal trauma in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'History'</a>.)</p><p>A history that does not match the severity of physical findings in children with genital injuries should raise concern for physical or sexual abuse. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-child-abuse-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical child abuse: Diagnostic evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'History'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of sexual abuse in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'History'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H626046836\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician should perform a complete physical examination to determine any associated injuries. In most patients with unintentional straddle injuries, isolated trauma to the genitalia and perineum is the sole finding. Patients with findings that suggest multiple trauma should undergo appropriate evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;, section on 'Initial approach'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H380714873\"><span class=\"h3\">Analgesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of the examination is to obtain information without further traumatizing the child. Younger patients may be less distressed if they are examined while sitting in the caretaker&rsquo;s lap.</p><p>Examination of the child with a straddle injury may be difficult because of anxiety and pain. Mild to moderate pain may be controlled with the application of a cold pack as tolerated or viscous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lidocaine</a> jelly (maximum dose 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> [0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of 2% viscous lidocaine]) to the affected area with a gauze pad. More severe pain may require opioid analgesia (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fentanyl</a> intravenously or intranasally) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sedation to obtain a complete examination. Sedation for examination may also be appropriate if laceration repair is anticipated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/straddle-injuries-in-children-evaluation-and-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

The labia, clitoris, urethra, hymen, vaginal orifice, perineum, and rectum are examined. It is essential that the examining physician be familiar with normal variants of the external female genitalia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50025\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50025 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gynecologic-examination-of-the-newborn-and-child#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gynecologic examination of the newborn and child&quot;, section on 'History and physical examination'</a>.)</p><p>Most straddle injuries in girls involve the mons, clitoral hood, and the labia minora and are located anterior or lateral to the hymen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/straddle-injuries-in-children-evaluation-and-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Vulvar hematomas and superficial vulvar lacerations in these regions are typical findings. Findings at examination that support unintentional injury include single or stellate lacerations <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bruising that is consistent with the history. (See <a href=\"#H626047384\" class=\"local\">'Girls'</a> below.)</p><p>Key findings of serious injury include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injury to the hymen <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> posterior fourchette</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal bleeding</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perineal lacerations or tears</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood at the urethral meatus, gross hematuria in the absence of adjacent bleeding, or periurethral laceration</p><p/><p>The examiner must have an understanding of normal hymenal variants if he or she is to identify abnormal hymenal findings. Trauma to the hymen or posterior fourchette is uncommonly seen with unintentional straddle injuries and should raise concern for sexual abuse. As an example, a laceration to the hymenal area that extends from 3 o'clock to 9 o'clock is consistent with a penetration injury and must be explored further. Bleeding that occurs after a hymenal injury is often minimal and in itself requires no treatment. However, such injuries may indicate vaginal penetration and possible vaginal injury and warrant assessment for deep tears into the perineum or rectum and vaginal perforation. A detailed examination under sedation or anesthesia by a surgeon with pediatric gynecologic expertise is warranted to exclude injuries of the upper vagina and intrapelvic viscera in patients with deep vaginal tears. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gynecologic-examination-of-the-newborn-and-child#H76606830\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gynecologic examination of the newborn and child&quot;, section on 'Evaluation of the hymen'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of sexual abuse in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Female genitalia'</a> and <a href=\"#H626047384\" class=\"local\">'Girls'</a> below.)</p><p>Vaginal bleeding is also an important finding that must be differentiated from pooling of blood from vulvar lacerations. Gentle irrigation with normal saline can often clarify the source of bleeding. Patients with vaginal bleeding warrant prompt consultation with a surgeon with pediatric gynecologic expertise for an examination which may require sedation or anesthesia. Bleeding of vaginal origin is unlikely if the hymen is intact and a source of bleeding on the external genitalia exists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/straddle-injuries-in-children-evaluation-and-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H626048093\" class=\"local\">'Indications for specialty referral or consultation'</a> below.)</p><p>The perineum is the supportive layer of tissue between the introitus and the rectum. This area may sustain a significant portion of the force exerted during penetrating trauma. Perineal lacerations or tears may only involve the perineal skin or my extend into deeper tissues including the perineal body, rectal sphincter, and rectal mucosa. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-female-lower-genital-tract-trauma#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of female lower genital tract trauma&quot;, section on 'Perineum'</a>.)</p><p>Urethral injury is unusual in females but may present with blood at the meatus, gross hematuria in the absence of adjacent bleeding, or signs of pelvic fracture, such as pain on palpation or rocking of the pelvis. Pelvic injuries can also cause vaginal lacerations and bleeding. Obstruction of the urethra and difficulty voiding may also occur in patients with large vulvar hematomas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blunt-genitourinary-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blunt genitourinary trauma: Initial evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'History, examination, and approach to testing'</a> and <a href=\"#H722045319\" class=\"local\">'Ability to void'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h4\">Boys</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The penis and scrotum should be inspected with the child lying supine and, if able, standing. Visualization of the anus, perineum, and posterior portion of the scrotum may be accomplished in the &ldquo;knee-chest&rdquo; position. Transillumination of the scrotum should be performed, especially in patients with significant scrotal swelling. Examination of the scrotum in boys is discussed in greater detail separately.

Most vaginal injuries occur as the result of penetrating trauma. The injury typically occurs when an object penetrates the vagina through the hymenal opening, creating a laceration or tear of the hymenal ring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/straddle-injuries-in-children-evaluation-and-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

The child may not complain of pain, and usually little blood loss occurs unless a major vessel is torn. Lacerations confined to the vaginal mucosa are repaired with the child under general anesthesia with fine suture material placed deep into the wound to approximate the tissues and obtain hemostasis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-female-lower-genital-tract-trauma#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of female lower genital tract trauma&quot;, section on 'Superficial lacerations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Deep lacerations and those that extend beyond the vagina either through the posterior cul de sac (pouch of Douglas) or into the rectum can cause significant hemorrhage that may require fluid resuscitation and blood administration. Thus, type and cross-matched blood should be available during operative repair. Lacerations that extend through the upper vagina may have associated injuries to a variety of structures including major blood vessels above the pelvic floor (eg, the ovarian, internal iliac, and external iliac vessels), the uterus, fallopian tubes, sigmoid colon, or small bowel. Patients suspected of these injuries warrant laparoscopy or exploratory laparotomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-female-lower-genital-tract-trauma#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of female lower genital tract trauma&quot;, section on 'Deep lacerations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-female-lower-genital-tract-trauma#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of female lower genital tract trauma&quot;, section on 'Extension beyond the vagina'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Hematomas of the vaginal wall may occur if bleeding vessels are not ligated before repair of the overlying vaginal mucosa. These hematomas may be managed with observation and analgesia if active bleeding stops and they are not enlarging; the blood clot eventually will resorb and the swelling subside. However, if the bleeding continues, the repaired laceration should be opened, the blood clot evacuated, and the bleeding points ligated. Packing the vagina may also be useful to promote tamponade of bleeding. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-female-lower-genital-tract-trauma#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of female lower genital tract trauma&quot;, section on 'Vagina'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Deep external laceration, urethral or rectal injury or laceration, or retained foreign body</strong> &ndash; Complicated lacerations of the vulva or perineum, suspected urethral injuries, or retained foreign bodies that are difficult to remove require consultation with the appropriate surgical specialist for further evaluation and repair. Patients with these injuries should receive tetanus prophylaxis, as needed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61087\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61087 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vulvar lacerations</strong> &ndash; Skin suturing is not needed for most vulvar lacerations caused by straddle injuries. Small vulvar lacerations without active bleeding should be treated with a topical antibiotic ointment and covered with a clean protective pad that is replaced after toileting. Perineal sutures, if necessary for hemostasis or cosmesis, should be placed with the child under procedural sedation or general anesthesia to decrease additional trauma for the child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/straddle-injuries-in-children-evaluation-and-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Tetanus prophylaxis is indicated, as needed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61087\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61087 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-female-lower-genital-tract-trauma#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of female lower genital tract trauma&quot;, section on 'Vulva'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vulvar hematomas</strong> &ndash; Most vulvar hematomas will resolve spontaneously. Small to moderate hematomas usually can be controlled by limitation of activity and local measures. Treatment with ice is recommended during the first 12 to 24 hours after injury to reduce edema. Warm tub baths or sitz baths two to three times per day may then be instituted. Tub baths keep the wound clean and may facilitate voiding in girls with mild urinary retention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/straddle-injuries-in-children-evaluation-and-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Large hematomas typically are managed with ice packs, bladder drainage, and analgesia. Sitz baths also may be used to remove secretions and contaminants. Pressure necrosis of the swollen external genitalia may be prevented by having the patient rest primarily on her side or back and use an air-filled rubber or foam &quot;doughnut&quot; when sitting. The ability to urinate should be assessed because large hematomas may obstruct the urethra. In patients with persistent urinary retention or a rapidly expanding vulvar hematoma, placement of a Foley catheter for bladder drainage may become necessary. Urinary retention that persists after the swelling subsides may indicate urethral avulsion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/straddle-injuries-in-children-evaluation-and-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Surgical drainage of vulvar hematomas is usually avoided because the small vessels that are involved in hematoma formation are difficult to identify. In addition, surgical disruption of the skin facilitates introduction of bacteria and may predispose the child to abscess formation. Hematomas associated with hemodynamic instability or that continue to increase in size warrant surgical treatment to evacuate the clot and to cauterize or ligate bleeding sites.

Examination of the child with a straddle injury may be difficult because of anxiety and pain. Mild to moderate pain may be controlled with local measures. More severe pain may require opioid analgesia (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fentanyl</a> intravenously or intranasally) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sedation to obtain a complete examination. Sedation for examination may also be appropriate if laceration repair is anticipated. (See <a href=\"#H626046843\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above and <a href=\"#H626046836\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most straddle injuries in girls involve the mons, clitoral hood, and the labia minora and are located anterior or lateral to the hymen. Vulvar hematomas and superficial vulvar lacerations in these regions are typical findings. Findings at examination that support unintentional injury include single or stellate lacerations <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bruising that is consistent with the history. Findings of serious injury include hymenal or posterior fourchette trauma, vaginal bleeding, perineal lacerations or tears, blood at the urethral meatus, gross hematuria, or periurethral laceration. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Girls'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Straddle injuries in boys typically result in mild scrotal swelling and bruising. Concerning findings include significant pain or swelling of the testicle or scrotum, an empty hemiscrotum indicating testicular dislocation, marked ecchymosis and swelling of the penis or perineum, laceration to the ventral penis, or laceration into the corporal bodies of the penile shaft (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76391\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76391 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H626047392\" class=\"local\">'Boys'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genital trauma that poorly correlates with a history of straddle injury, occurs in an infant younger than nine months, is associated with abnormal genital <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> perianal lesions or secretions or other physical findings of abuse (eg, patterned bruising or burns) warrants involvement of an experienced child protection team (eg, social worker, nurse, physician with more extensive experience in the management of child sexual abuse) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> referral to a child sexual abuse center, if available. In many parts of the world, a mandatory report to appropriate governmental authorities is also required. (See <a href=\"#H626046110\" class=\"local\">'Findings suggesting child abuse'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because of the potential for urethral damage as a complication of straddle injuries, the clinician should ensure that all patients can urinate. Many children with straddle injuries are apprehensive and may refuse to void initially. If physical findings indicate that the bladder is not overdistended and that the likelihood of an injury requiring sedation or operative care is low, the clinician may encourage voiding by administering mild analgesia (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a> orally) and use local measures to reduce pain.
