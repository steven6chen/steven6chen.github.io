Patients with chronic lung disease are at increased risk for pneumococcal pneumonia, and patients with conditions such as heart failure are more likely to have adverse outcomes if pneumonia occurs. Asplenia greatly increases the risk for overwhelming pneumococcal sepsis, and a cerebrospinal fluid leak or a cochlear implant greatly increases the risk for pneumococcal meningitis. Pneumococcal vaccination is recommended for all children and for adults who have a condition that places them at increased risk for developing pneumonia or invasive pneumococcal disease or for having a serious outcome should pneumonia develop.</p><p>The highest incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease occurs in children &lt;2 years of age, persons who have conditions that compromise antibody responses (eg, solid organ transplantation, multiple myeloma, HIV infection), and those &ge;65 years of age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F88701\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88701 \">table 1</a>). The highest mortality rates occur in individuals &ge;65 years of age, especially in those who have significant comorbidities.

Antibody to capsule greatly facilitates phagocytosis and killing. Accordingly, capsular polysaccharides are the essential components of all currently available pneumococcal vaccines. More than 90 different pneumococcal capsular serotypes have been identified. Since it is not possible to include all of the serotypes in a pneumococcal vaccine, available vaccines contain capsular polysaccharides from serotypes that are most commonly implicated as causes of pneumococcal disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-and-pathogenesis-of-streptococcus-pneumoniae#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology and pathogenesis of Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;, section on 'Capsule'</a>.)</p><p>Two types of pneumococcal vaccines are approved for use in the United States:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumococcal-polysaccharide-vaccine-23-valent-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine</a> (PPSV; Pneumovax) was first marketed in the 1970s as a vaccine that contained capsular polysaccharides from 14 pneumococcal serotypes that commonly caused disease. In 1983, this vaccine was augmented to include capsular polysaccharides from the 23 most commonly infecting pneumococcal serotypes and is marketed as Pneumovax 23 (PPSV23) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77274\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77274 \">table 2</a>). At present, PPSV23 contains capsular polysaccharides from pneumococci that cause about 60 percent of all pneumococcal infection in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. PPSV is used in selected adults and children &ge;2 years of age but not in infants or toddlers &lt;2 years of age since polysaccharide antigens are poorly immunogenic in this age group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine</strong> (PCV; Prevnar) was initially marketed in the United States in 2000 as PCV7, a vaccine containing polysaccharides from the seven pneumococcal serotypes that caused most pneumococcal disease in young children. The polysaccharides are covalently linked to a nontoxic protein that is nearly identical to diphtheria toxin, which renders the polysaccharides antigenic in infants and toddlers. Because PCV7 is an excellent immunogen in infants and toddlers, it was adopted in the United States for universal use in this age group in 2000. In 2010, PCV7 was replaced by PCV13, a vaccine that has added serotypes commonly implicated in disease to those contained in PCV7. Since 2010, PCV13 has been recommended for infants and children in place of PCV7. It is also recommended for selected adults. PCVs with different numbers of serotypes are produced in other parts of the world (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77274\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77274 \">table 2</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Because PCV stimulates mucosal antibody, it greatly suppresses nasal carriage of <em>S. pneumoniae</em> due to vaccine serotypes. Not surprisingly, therefore, widespread use of PCV7 has reduced spread of pneumococci from small children, the usual reservoir of pneumococcal carriage, to unvaccinated older children and adults, an effect that is called an indirect (or &quot;herd&quot;) effect. In the pre-PCV era, about 65 to 70 percent of pneumococcal pneumonia in adults was caused by strains included in PCV7. By 2008 in the United States, disease due to these types had nearly disappeared from the adult population, largely as a result of this indirect effect. The same kind of decline in infection of adults due to serotypes in PCV13 has begun to be apparent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In one study, it was estimated that, in 2013, PCV13 stimulated antibody to serotypes that caused 28 to 42 percent of invasive pneumococcal disease in adults in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In the United States and other countries with universal PCV immunization programs, this percentage is declining as a result of indirect immunity, with a three- to four-year lag period when compared to the effect on invasive pneumococcal disease in vaccinated children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p>The indications for use of PPSV23 and PCV13 in adults are presented below.

We agree with this recommendation.</p><p>In 2014, the ACIP extended its recommendation for sequential administration of both PCV13 and PPSV23 to all adults &ge;65 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The ACIP will reevaluate its recommendations for adults &ge;65 years of age in 2018 and will revise them as needed. In contrast to the ACIP, some UpToDate authors and editors give only PPSV23 (but <strong>not</strong> PCV13) to otherwise healthy individuals aged &ge;65 years. The rationale for our recommendation is discussed below (see <a href=\"#H3605128972\" class=\"local\">'Overview of benefits and limitations'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3326988431\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> below). Most developed countries (eg, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Spain) do not recommend the routine use of PCV13 in adults &ge;65 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>In 2011, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved PCV13 for use in adults &ge;50 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], and, in 2016, they expanded the approved age range to include adults 18 to 49 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. It is important to note, however, that approval by the FDA is not the same as a recommendation for use. The ACIP does <strong>not</strong> recommend PCV13 for routine use in adults &lt;65 years of age, and we concur.</p><p>Specific recommendations for pneumococcal vaccination of hematopoietic cell transplant recipients are presented separately.

It is an unfortunate fact that those persons, who are in greatest need of pneumococcal vaccination, are least likely to respond to either vaccine.</p><p>The ACIP also recommends that all adults aged &ge;65 years of age should receive <strong>both</strong> PCV13 and PPV23. The rationale for this is that both the incidence of pneumococcal disease and the mortality rate increase after age 50 and more sharply after age 65 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F88701\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88701 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The incidence of pneumococcal disease and the associated mortality are very low in adults under the age of 50. In contrast with the ACIP, some UpToDate authors and editors give only PPSV23 (but <strong>not</strong> PCV13) to otherwise healthy individuals aged &ge;65 years, an approach also used in many European countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. We do not believe that PCV13 is warranted in such individuals because it is not clear that immunizing this group with PCV13 followed by PPSV23 provides benefit beyond that derived from PPSV23 alone. A further point underlying any recommendation for administering PCV13 to adults in most developed countries is that routine administration of this vaccine to all children &lt;2 years produces such profound indirect (&quot;herd&quot;) immunity that there can be little if any incremental benefit from using PCV13 in adults. This is discussed in greater detail below. (See <a href=\"#H3605128972\" class=\"local\">'Overview of benefits and limitations'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3326988431\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> below.)</p><p>We do, however, favor the use of <strong>both</strong> PCV13 and PPSV23 in patients &ge;65 years of age who have one of the conditions for which PPSV23 is indicated before age 65 (cigarette smokers; patients with chronic heart disease, chronic lung disease, diabetes mellitus, alcohol use disorder, or chronic liver disease) We do use <strong>both</strong> PCV13 and PPSV23 for individuals &ge;65 years of age who are planning to travel to a country that does not have a universal immunization program mandating pneumococcal conjugate vaccination for all infants and toddlers.

However, if there is any risk that the patient will not return for the second vaccination, we favor giving both vaccines at the same time but in different arms.

This decline is seen both among children who are vaccinated and, because the vaccine effectively eradicates nasal colonization, also among older, unvaccinated children and adults. This phenomenon, called the indirect (or &quot;herd&quot;) effect, has resulted in a greater than 90 percent decline in pneumococcal disease due to serotypes contained in the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) among older children who did not receive the vaccine, as well as among adults (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64834\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64834 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].

The most well-studied immunocompromised group has been HIV-infected patients in Africa. In an early study, at a time when treatment for HIV infection was not available, the 23-valent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumococcal-polysaccharide-vaccine-23-valent-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine</a> (PPSV23) offered no protection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In a later study that immunized predominantly HIV-infected patients with PCV7, PCV7 was effective, but only during the first year following vaccination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Some experts use the results of these studies to support claims that pneumococcal conjugate vaccine is more effective than pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine in HIV-infected patients. We do not agree with that conclusion because about 15 percent of patients in the second study were not HIV infected and, more importantly, 46 percent were receiving antiretroviral therapy by the end of the study period. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumococcal-immunization-in-hiv-infected-adults#H11160237\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pneumococcal immunization in HIV-infected adults&quot;, section on 'Efficacy and immunogenicity of pneumococcal vaccination'</a>.)</p><p>The CAPiTA trial, a randomized trial that included nearly 85,000 Dutch adults &ge;65 years age, compared protection against pneumococcal disease in recipients of PCV13 or placebo. This trial demonstrated 46 percent efficacy of PCV13 against vaccine-type pneumococcal pneumonia, 45 percent efficacy against vaccine-type nonbacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia, and 75 percent efficacy against vaccine-type invasive pneumococcal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Three important points need to be made about this trial: there was no comparison with PPSV23, which, historically, has demonstrated an even higher rate of protection; universal vaccination of children was not accomplished before the start of the study; and immunocompromised adults were excluded from the study. Most importantly, persons who developed an immunocompromising condition during the years of observation after they received PCV13 had no demonstrable protection from PCV13. (See <a href=\"#H3326988431\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> below.)</p><p>A further point is that the most recent studies in the United States that have searched intensively for an etiology of CAP have implicated <em>S. pneumoniae </em>as a cause of only 5 to 9 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/35,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,41</a>]. The low frequency with which <em>S. pneumoniae</em> appears to cause CAP mitigates the need for extending the PCV13 vaccine program for older adults. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-microbiology-of-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and microbiology of community-acquired pneumonia in adults&quot;, section on 'S. pneumoniae'</a>.)</p><p>The recommendation to give both PPSV23 and PCV13 to high-risk adults is far more costly than recommending PPSV23 alone. In addition, adherence to a two-vaccine regimen is likely to be poorer than adherence to a one-vaccine regimen. Despite the strength of the current ACIP recommendation, data supporting this approach are meager.</p><p>An untoward effect of the widespread use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines has been the emergence of &quot;replacement strains,&quot; a term used to describe nonvaccine pneumococcal serotypes that appear as colonizers of the nasopharynx and as a cause of pneumococcal disease in recipients of PCV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Reduction in nasal carriage of PCV serotypes appears to create an ecologic niche for nonvaccine serotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. As an example, <em>S. pneumoniae</em> type 19A (not included in PCV7 but later added in PCV13) emerged as the most common cause of pneumococcal disease in children and adults a few years after universal vaccination with PCV7 began in the United States (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64834\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64834 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/33,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,44</a>].

A decline in pneumococcal disease due to the serotypes that have been added to PCV13 has already been noted. In the first half of 2012, only 29 percent of all invasive pneumococcal disease in United States adults were caused by PCV13 serotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Some European countries have used a 10-valent vaccine, and a 15-valent vaccine is in development.</p><p>In 2012, PCV13 began to be recommended for use in selected high-risk adults. In 2014, the United States Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended PCV13 for all adults &ge;65 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

However, in contrast to the ACIP, we give only PPSV23 (but <strong>not</strong> PCV13) to otherwise healthy individuals aged &ge;65 years. Detailed recommendations are provided above.

While, in theory, it might have seemed likely that PCVs would induce a more persistent immune response than PPSV23, studies comparing these two vaccine types show that, 12 months after vaccination, antibody activity in serum was identical in subjects who received PCV13 or PPSV23 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1774670717\"><span class=\"h3\">Immunologic priming</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because PCVs stimulate memory B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>], it was reasonable to hypothesize that such vaccines might prime the immune system for an enhanced secondary immune response to a PPSV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/43,70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,70,71</a>].

The trial demonstrated 46 percent efficacy (95% CI 22 to 63 percent) of PCV13 against vaccine-type pneumococcal pneumonia, 45 percent efficacy (95% CI 14 to 65 percent) against vaccine-type nonbacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia, and 75 percent efficacy (95% CI 41 to 91 percent) against vaccine-type invasive pneumococcal disease. Efficacy persisted for the duration of the trial (mean follow-up four years). There was no decrease in all-cause community-acquired pneumonia among those who received the vaccine. The number of deaths associated with pneumococcal disease was too small to allow an analysis of the effect of the vaccine on this outcome. A post-hoc analysis showed that efficacy for preventing vaccine-type-specific community-acquired pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal disease declined from 65 percent for individuals who were 65 years of age at the time of vaccination to 40 percent in those who were 75 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p>Because this trial began before PCV13 was used routinely in infants in the Netherlands, it leaves unanswered the question of whether administering PCV13 to adults will prove efficacious in countries that routinely administer this vaccine to infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pneumococcal-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

However, in contrast to the ACIP, we give only PPSV23 (but <strong>not</strong> PCV13) to otherwise healthy individuals aged &ge;65 years:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In accordance with the ACIP, for adults 19 to 64 years of age at intermediate risk of pneumococcal disease (ie, cigarette smokers; patients with chronic heart disease, chronic lung disease, diabetes mellitus, alcohol use disorder, or chronic liver disease), we recommend pneumococcal vaccination (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Such patients should receive PPSV23 alone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F107909\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef107909 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In accordance with the ACIP, for adults aged 19 or older who are at high risk of pneumococcal disease (ie, patients with functional or anatomic asplenia, an immunocompromising condition [eg, HIV infection, cancer], a cerebrospinal fluid leak, a cochlear implant, advanced kidney disease), we recommend pneumococcal vaccination with PCV13 followed at least eight weeks later by PPSV23 (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). In patients who have already received PPSV23, at least one year should elapse before they are given PCV13.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For <strong>all</strong> adults &ge;65 years of age, we recommend pneumococcal vaccination (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). The ACIP states that individuals &ge;65 years of age should receive both PCV13 and PPSV23 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F107908\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef107908 \">algorithm 5</a>). In contrast, for individuals &ge;65 years of age without any of the high-risk conditions described in the previous bullet, some UpToDate authors and editors give PPSV23 (but <strong>not</strong> PCV13). However, we all favor the use of <strong>both</strong> PCV13 and PPSV23 in adults &ge;65 years of age who have one of the conditions for which PPSV23 is indicated before age 65 (cigarette smokers; patients with chronic heart disease, chronic lung disease, diabetes mellitus, alcohol use disorder, or chronic liver disease). We use <strong>both</strong> PCV13 and PPSV23 in patients &ge;65 years of age who are planning to travel to a country that does not have a universal immunization program mandating pneumococcal conjugate vaccine administration for all infants and toddlers. The vaccination approach for immunocompromised patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F107906\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef107906 \">algorithm 2</a>) and asplenic patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F109172\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef109172 \">algorithm 3</a>) as well as patients with a CSF leak, cochlear implant, or history of invasive pneumococcal disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F107907\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef107907 \">algorithm 4</a>) is summarized in algorithms. It is preferable to give PCV13 first, followed by PPSV23 &ge;1 year later. If PPSV23 is given first, PCV13 should be given &ge;1 year later.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>PCV13 is <strong>not</strong> recommended for healthy adults &lt;65 years of age who do not have a specific risk factor for pneumococcal infection. (See <a href=\"#H3536748441\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The schedule for revaccination with PPSV23 depends on the patient's age and underlying diseases:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For immunocompromised patients and individuals with functional or anatomic asplenia who are &lt;65 years of age, the ACIP recommends one single revaccination with PPSV23 &ge;5 years after the first dose. However, for asplenic individuals, some European public health agencies recommend reimmunization with PPSV23 every five years; we agree with this approach.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The ACIP recommends a single revaccination with PPSV23 in adults &ge;65 years of age if they received this vaccine before age 65; it should be administered five or more years after the previous dose. We agree with the ACIP's recommendation for revaccination with PPSV23 at or after age 65; however, following this dose (and in contrast to the ACIP), we also favor revaccinating older adults at 10-year intervals because immunologic responses wane in older adult patients. (See <a href=\"#H1633210399\" class=\"local\">'Revaccination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Revaccination with PCV13 is <strong>not</strong> recommended. (See <a href=\"#H1633210399\" class=\"local\">'Revaccination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PPSV23 and PCV13 are each administered intramuscularly as a 0.5 mL dose. They may be administered concurrently with other vaccines, such as the influenza vaccine, but at a separate site. However, PPSV23 and PCV13 should be administered at different times as outlined above. (See <a href=\"#H2843573535\" class=\"local\">'Administration'</a> above and <a href=\"#H770590020\" class=\"local\">'Schedule for dual vaccination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The trend for vaccine strains to disappear from the population following universal immunization of infants may substantially reduce the potential benefit of PCV13 use in adults. The ACIP has stated that they will reconsider the recommendations for the use of PCV13 in adults in 2018. (See <a href=\"#H3536748441\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3605128972\" class=\"local\">'Overview of benefits and limitations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3326988431\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indirect evidence for a possible benefit of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine over PPSV23 in immunocompromised adults comes from randomized trials in HIV-infected individuals in Africa, which demonstrated a reduction in invasive pneumococcal disease among individuals who received PCV7 but no reduction in recipients of PPSV23. These trials were not, however, entirely comparable. In a large placebo-controlled trial of individuals &ge;65 years of age in the Netherlands, PCV13 reduced the risk of vaccine-type pneumococcal pneumonia, vaccine-type nonbacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia, and vaccine-type invasive pneumococcal disease; this trial did not include a group that received PPSV23.
