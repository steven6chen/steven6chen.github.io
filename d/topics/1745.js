The majority of the studies on the epidemiology of bad breath are small and focus on self-reported halitosis, which limits the validity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bad-breath/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Most of the people affected are not aware of having halitosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bad-breath/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Bad breath affects all ages, including children, although it is more commonly seen in the adult population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bad-breath/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Men and women are equally affected.</p><p>In addition, approximately 25 percent of the patients seeing a health care professional for a complaint of bad breath do not have true halitosis (the so-called &quot;halitophobics&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bad-breath/abstract/5,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2300186108\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of cases of halitosis (80 to 90 percent)<sup> </sup>arise from intraoral causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bad-breath/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Oral malodor is associated with poor oral hygiene and periodontal disease (gingivitis and periodontitis), although individuals without such disorders may also experience halitosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bad-breath/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Bad breath is predominantly caused by bacterial action on material between the teeth and debris on the dorsum of the posterior one-third of the tongue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bad-breath/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The tongue is particularly important, as the crevices and fissures provide a favorable environment for the growth of odor-causing bacteria. Dry mouth, defective dental restorations, odontogenic abscess, and unclean dentures may also contribute to bad breath [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bad-breath/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The primary microorganisms implicated in the etiology of halitosis are Gram-negative anaerobes, which include <em>Bacteroides forsythus, Porphyromonas gingivalis</em>, <em>Prevotella intermedia</em>, <em>Fusobacterium nucleatum</em>, <em>Treponema denticola</em>, <em>Tannerella forsythensis</em>, <em>Porphyromonas endodontalis</em>, and<em> Eubacterium </em>spp<em>. </em>Gram-positive microorganisms may also be involved in the production of malodor by deglycosylating glycoproteins that are subsequently broken down by proteolytic enzymes secreted by the Gram-negative bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bad-breath/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. <em>Solobacterium moorei </em>is a Gram-positive bacterium that is associated with oral malodor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bad-breath/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>Bacteria involved in the pathogenesis of bad breath release malodorous chemicals. Volatile sulphur compounds (VSCs), such as hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan, and dimethyl sulfide, are especially important. VSCs arise via microbial degradation of methionine and cysteine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bad-breath/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Other gases that are byproducts of amino acid degradation and may be implicated in the pathogenesis of bad breath include indole and skatole (via breakdown of tryptophan), cadaverine (via breakdown of lysine), putrescine, and short-chain fatty acids (butyric, valeric, and propionic) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bad-breath/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3459505917\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES OF HALITOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Halitosis can be classified as physiologic, pathologic, or subjective (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F115551\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115551 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3050700451\"><span class=\"h2\">Physiologic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physiologic halitosis commonly occurs in the morning as a result of relatively low flow of saliva. It results from the action of bacteria on desquamated epithelial cells and entrapped food particles on the dorsum of the tongue. It may be more prominent with lack of attention to personal oral hygiene. It usually resolves immediately after brushing, flossing, eating, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> drinking water.</p><p>Other causes of temporary halitosis include tobacco smoking and consumption of aromatic food (eg, garlic, onions) and certain beverages (eg, alcohol, coffee) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bad-breath/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4155080124\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathologic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pathologic causes of halitosis can be categorized according to the anatomic site of origin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F115551\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115551 \">table 1</a>). Malignant tumors, a rare cause of halitosis, can arise from multiple anatomic sites, including the oral cavity, nasal cavity, oropharynx, nasopharynx, hypopharynx, larynx, trachea, and esophagus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1477192449\"><span class=\"h3\">Oral</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pathology within the mouth is the most common identifiable cause of halitosis. When pathology in the mouth is producing halitosis, an observer will find the greatest odor coming from the mouth.</p><p>Oral causes of halitosis include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Periodontal infections harbor Gram-negative bacteria that produce volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs).

In contrast to physiologic halitosis, halitosis from excessive tongue coating does not improve substantially as the day progresses. A strongly malodorous tongue scraping suggests that excessive tongue coating is the cause of the halitosis. (See <a href=\"#H3920649837\" class=\"local\">'Organoleptic tests'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dry mouth is associated with halitosis, as the lack of salivary flow compromises the antimicrobial action of the saliva, leading to more bacteria within the mouth and increased plaque on the teeth and coating on the tongue. Many medications can cause dry mouth, including diuretics, antihistamines and decongestants, tricyclic antidepressants, and amphetamines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tonsillar pathology accounts for a small percentage of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bad-breath/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with chronic caseous tonsillitis may have retention <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> discharge of cheese-like, whitish material from the crypts with associated malodor. Over time, this material mineralizes to form tonsilloliths. Tonsilloliths are strongly associated with high levels of VSCs because of the presence of anaerobic bacteria including <em>Eubacterium</em>, <em>Fusobacterium, Porphyromonas</em>, <em>Prevotella</em>, <em>Selenomonas</em>, and<em> Tannerella</em> spp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bad-breath/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Peritonsillar abscess also can cause bad breath.

Patients with halitophobia are often obsessed with oral hygiene and brush their teeth multiple times a day and frequently rinse or gargle. They often are convinced that their problem is organic and may resist consultation with a mental health provider [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bad-breath/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>In the neurologic variant of subjective halitosis, taste or smell disorders (dysgeusia and dysosmia) cause the patient to perceive bad breath when it is not objectively present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bad-breath/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Dysgeusia may be a manifestation of hyposalivation, vitamin and mineral deficiencies, nerve injuries, neurodegenerative diseases, and drugs.

A useful approach is to consider these questions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the patient have bad breath by clinician examination?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The odor at the time of examination may not accurately reflect what is typical for the patient. Bad breath can vary with the time of day; it is worse upon waking when salivary flow is relatively low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bad-breath/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. It also may be worse with menstruation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bad-breath/abstract/18,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Breath odor also may be affected by oral hygiene, smoking, eating or drinking, and concomitant antibiotic use. If the visit is scheduled specifically for evaluation of bad breath, patients should be advised to refrain from oral hygiene procedures (eg, brushing teeth, using mouth rinse), using tobacco products, eating, drinking, or chewing gum for three hours before the appointment. Patients who are taking antibiotics should be rescheduled.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If so, is there an identifiable cause that can be treated by the primary care clinician (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F115551\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115551 \">table 1</a>)?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the cause cannot be treated by the primary care clinician, the patient should be referred to the appropriate specialist (dentist, mental health provider, neurologist) (See <a href=\"#H2120015676\" class=\"local\">'Indications for referral'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3973386195\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of a patient with a chief complaint of halitosis should begin with a thorough medical and dental history. The clinician should assess oral hygiene practices; whether the patient is mouth breather, snores, or has excess nasal discharge or obstruction; as well as assess for any potentially contributory underlying systemic medical condition. The patient should be asked where they think the malodor is coming from and why. Patients with halitosis often have difficulty assessing their disorder in an objective manner and typically ask family members or friends for a confirmation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bad-breath/abstract/5,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1562748453\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to do a physical examination of the patient&rsquo;s mouth, pharynx, and nose.

The clinician assesses the intensity of odor in the air expired from the nose or mouth or the odor of a tongue scraping, dental appliance, or length of dental floss. It is widely used in the evaluation of halitosis and is considered the gold standard despite its subjectivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bad-breath/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The quality of the odor can also be assessed (hedonic method), but this requires specific training, so it is infrequently done.</p><p>An oral or pharyngeal origin is suspected if the odor is largely confined to the mouth and not the nose (see <a href=\"#H1477192449\" class=\"local\">'Oral'</a> above); nasal involvement is suspected if the odor is largely confined to the nose or has a telltale characteristic odor (see <a href=\"#H3451346185\" class=\"local\">'Nasal'</a> above). A systemic origin is suspected in the rare cases in which the odor emanates both from the mouth and nose and has the same quality. (See <a href=\"#H3396221628\" class=\"local\">'Systemic'</a> above.)</p><p>A widely used scale uses the following scoring system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bad-breath/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>0 = no odor</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>1 = barely detectable odor</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>2 = slight odor</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>3 = moderate odor</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>4 = strong foul odor</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>5 = unbearably strong foul odor</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H272680348\"><span class=\"h4\">Mouth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mouth odor is evaluated by asking the patient to breathe out though the mouth. The examiner smells the odor from a distance of 5 to 10 cm and scores the odor.</p><p>In addition, it may be helpful to ask the patient to count out loud to 20 and repeat the above. This is because the odor is sometimes more obvious when the patient is speaking.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H376132422\"><span class=\"h4\">Tongue</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The tongue odor can be evaluated by taking a plastic spoon in one hand, a piece of gauze in the other, and asking the patient to stick out the tongue as far as possible and to hold his or her breath. Wrap the gauze around the tip of the tongue and hold it with one hand, using the spoon with the other hand to scoop up some of the mucus at the very back of the tongue dorsum towards the throat (about 12 cm from the tip of the adult tongue). Wait a few seconds. Smell and score the spoon. In many cases, a yellowish discharge is collected on the spoon; although there is no direct evidence, this discharge is probably postnasal drip. Excessive or viscous postnasal drip is extremely common and is usually not indicative of any frank nasal infection or other pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bad-breath/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3926209587\"><span class=\"h4\">Teeth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The contribution of the teeth to halitosis can be assessed by scoring the odor of dental floss after the patient has used it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3804553429\"><span class=\"h4\">Dentures/dental restorations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If present, dentures and removable dental restorations should be removed and the odor scored.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3340108989\"><span class=\"h4\">Nose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nasal odor is evaluated by asking the patient to close his or her mouth and breathe out through the nose.

Such quantitative and semiquantitative measurements can be helpful, but they do not substitute for clinician judgment and should be used in conjunction with organoleptic tests. These tests are typically done by specialists in halitosis or in research settings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H82342024\"><span class=\"h4\">Sulfide monitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measurements of mouth-air VSC content can be performed using portable sulfide monitors.</p><p>Subjects are asked to close their mouth for 120 to 180 seconds before mouth air is collected through a disposable plastic straw inserted deep into the oral cavity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bad-breath/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. A suction pump pulls the air into the instrument, where concentrations of VSCs are measured by an electrochemical sensor. The measurement takes only a few seconds and is expressed in ppb (parts per billion). Halitosis is usually defined by VSC concentrations &gt;100 ppb [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bad-breath/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p>Sulfide monitor readings are sensitive to reductions in oral odor levels following the use of mouthrinses, so these should not be used on the day of testing. While VSCs are the major cause of halitosis, it is important to recognize that non-VSC compounds are not detected by sulfide monitors and may contribute to halitosis. (See <a href=\"#H2300186108\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1636597428\"><span class=\"h4\">Gas chromatography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Portable gas chromatographic analyzers are also available to measure VSCs. They are equipped with an indium oxide semiconductor gas sensor which measures the concentration of hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan, and dimethyl sulfide. Dimethyl sulfide is not well detected by sulfide monitors.</p><p>Samples are collected through a disposable plastic syringe inserted deep into the oral cavity and held between the lips. Subjects must close their mouth for 30 seconds before sample collection; 0.5 cc of air is then injected into the measuring device. The measurement of the concentrations of VSCs takes a few minutes and is expressed in <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/10</span> mL and ppb.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2120015676\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR REFERRAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial evaluation of patients complaining of bad breath can be done by the primary care clinician.

In addition, bacterial activity leading to bad breath is greatest during sleep, when saliva flow is practically zero and microbial activity is highest. The quaternary agents active in many mouthwashes (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetylpyridinium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetylpyridinium</a> chloride, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a>) may be inactivated by the anionic detergents in toothpastes; thus, patients should be advised to use mouthrinse an hour or more after brushing their teeth. Since much of the odor is associated with the posterior dorsal tongue, it is important to gargle in addition to oral rinsing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The most efficacious oral rinses for short-term use are those containing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a> gluconate 0.2%, but in the United States only 0.12% is readily available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bad-breath/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].
