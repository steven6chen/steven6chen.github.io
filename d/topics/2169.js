The disorder is associated with receiving extensive clinical attention and the disorder is more widely studied than any other personality disorder. Despite these efforts, patients with BPD continue to suffer considerable morbidity and increased mortality compared with the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, course, assessment, and diagnosis of BPD will be reviewed here.

Large, nationally representative, nonclinical surveys of the United States general population estimate that the point prevalence of BPD is 1.6 percent and the lifetime prevalence is 5.9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Studies in clinical settings found BPD was present in 6.4 percent of urban primary care patients, 9.3 percent of psychiatric outpatients, and approximately 20 percent of psychiatric inpatients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p>The ratio of females to males with the disorder is greater in clinical populations than it is in the general population. The ratio is 3:1 in clinical settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Two epidemiologic surveys of the United States general population, however, have found the lifetime prevalence of BPD does not differ significantly between men and women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. This discrepancy suggests that women with BPD are more likely to seek treatment than men. In a study of patients with BPD, men and women were found to have similar rates of childhood-trauma history and levels of current psychosocial functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Study findings are mixed regarding the relationship between BPD and ethnicity. A study of patients presenting to clinical facilities found significantly higher rates of BPD in Hispanics compared with Caucasians and African Americans (64 versus 39 versus 40 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. One United States epidemiologic study found the prevalence of BPD to be less frequent among Hispanic men and women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], while another found that it was not significantly related to race and ethnicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H462912444\"><span class=\"h2\">Comorbidities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Co-occurring psychiatric disorders are common in patients with BPD, especially mood (depressive, bipolar), anxiety, substance-use, eating, and somatoform disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F52837\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52837 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. An epidemiologic survey found that 85 percent of individuals with BPD have at least one comorbid mental disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The mean number of current comorbid disorders was 3.2 in the epidemiologic survey and 3.4 in a study of borderline outpatients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,13</a>].

Two studies found the concordance rate for BPD was higher in monozygotic twins compared with dizygotic twins (35 and 36 percent versus 7 and 19 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. A third twin study found the proportion of variance in BPD in the general community explained by environmental influences was greater than that explained by genetic influences (58 versus 42 percent of the variance) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Another approach to studying the disorder's genetic basis has tried to identify the heritability of endophenotypes, such as certain psychopathologic traits or behaviors. A review supported the idea that a constitutional predisposition to emotion dysregulation, combined with a nonvalidating (nonsupporting) environment, leads to the development of BPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Future research on the genetics of BPD will likely focus increasingly on endophenotypes and on gene x environment interactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurobiologic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preclinical research suggests that perhaps altered neuropeptide function underlies the interpersonal problems of these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Attachment insecurity, leading to impairments in social cognition, including maladaptive representations of self, others, and self in relation to others, are believed to be at the core of the interpersonal difficulties of patients with BPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] and may be modulated by the oxytocinergic system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In addition, numerous neurotransmitter and neuroimaging studies have compared patients with BPD to healthy controls, and found abnormalities such as serotonin dysfunction and bilateral reductions in the hippocampus, amygdala, and other regions of the medial temporal lobe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. It is difficult to interpret such results because the studies enrolled and investigated adult patients who already met criteria for BPD. Thus, it is not clear whether the observed neurobiological correlates represent etiologic causes or sequelae of the disorder. Making this distinction requires a longitudinal study that enrolls premorbid children or adolescents. The specificity of the neurotransmitter and neuroimaging findings to BPD is also unknown.</p><p>Research findings demonstrate widespread neuropsychologic deficits in patient with BPD linked largely to frontal lobe functioning, and support the idea that many symptoms of the disorder, such as affective instability and identity disturbance, are due to disrupted connections between the prefrontal cortex and other brain regions controlling higher cognitive functions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1303151\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychosocial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A history of childhood trauma is common in patients with BPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, the relationship between trauma and BPD is not clear. Childhood trauma is not always present in patients with BPD, and many individuals who suffer abuse do not develop BPD.</p><p>The trauma that is often present in the history of patients with BPD can take many forms, including sexual abuse, physical abuse, verbal abuse, neglect, and early parental separation or loss. A systematic review found high rates of childhood sexual (16 to 71 percent) and physical (10 to 73 percent) abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p>Clinical trials on the relationship between childhood trauma and BPD have been mixed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective, community based, longitudinal study of 639 children found that childhood abuse or neglect was eventually and significantly associated with BPD in young adulthood, after controlling for parental education and parental psychopathology (odds ratio [OR] 7.7, 95% CI 1.8-33.5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective study of 500 individuals with documented cases of childhood physical and sexual abuse and neglect found that more physically abused <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neglected children met criteria for BPD as adults, compared with controls. Individuals with a history of childhood sexual abuse were not at increased risk for BPD. Having a parent with drug or alcohol problems, not being employed full-time, not being a high school graduate, and having a diagnosis of drug abuse, major depressive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder mediated the relationship between abuse and neglect and adult BPD, suggesting multiple pathways to BPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other studies have not found childhood sexual abuse to be a major risk factor or causal antecedent of BPD. Meta-analyses have found only small effect sizes for the association between childhood sexual abuse and BPD, as well as for the association between childhood sexual abuse and self-injurious behavior (a common manifestation of BPD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. A meta-analysis found that college students with a history of childhood sexual abuse were only slightly less well-adjusted than control students [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Poorer adjustment could not be attributed to childhood sexual abuse because family environment was consistently confounded with childhood sexual abuse. A longitudinal study of over 1300 twin pairs followed from age 11 to 24 showed that the association between childhood abuse and BPD stemmed from common genetic influences, which were inherited vulnerabilities to internalizing and externalizing disorders in general [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The core features of borderline personality disorder (BPD) are instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image, affect, and marked impulsivity. </p><p> A useful model organizes features of the disorder into three dimensions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impaired relatedness &ndash; unstable relationships with others, identity disturbance, and chronic emptiness</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Affective dysregulation &ndash; affective lability, excessive anger, and efforts to avoid abandonment</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Behavior dysregulation &ndash; impulsivity, suicidality, and self-injurious behavior</p><p/><p>Affective instability has been shown to be the most sensitive and specific single manifestation of BPD (and thus a potentially useful screen) in a sample of 3674 psychiatric outpatients evaluated with a semi-structured interview [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. All manifestations of BPD are associated with psychosocial impairment in this same population, even in the absence of the others, but only chronic emptiness was found to be a marker of all types of morbidity, including suicidality, history of suicide attempts and hospitalizations, social and work dysfunction, axis I (symptom) disorder comorbidity, and global functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Interpersonal difficulties</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with BPD usually have stormy relationships, especially with people to whom patients are close [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. At one moment, a friend or romantic partner may be viewed not only as a trusted confidant but as an ideal, almost perfect person, and then this same individual can suddenly be seen as cruel, betraying, very limited, and damaged. When the idealized person is present and supportive, the patient feels strong and solid. However, if the support person leaves (or is unable to meet the patient's needs), even for a limited time, or if the patient thinks that the support person is about to leave, the patient can immediately become angry, demeaning, demanding, depressed, hopeless, and suicidal.</p><p>Patients tend to view others as all good or all bad, a phenomenon that has been labeled &quot;splitting&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Rigidly classifying other people as good or bad can lead the patient to shift between extreme points of view and to selectively attend to information in a way that confirms his or her current opinion. This tendency to &quot;split&quot; can impact treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-borderline-personality-disorder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of borderline personality disorder&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with BPD often interpret neutral events, words, or faces as &quot;negative&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. Thus, the patient is prone to misinterpret relatively minor disagreements or adverse events as a sign that the caretaker wants to terminate the relationship. The patient often reacts with anger or threats of self-harm, which can alienate the support person, who then may really want to end the relationship. This heightened sensitivity to actual or perceived rejection most likely is what leads to patients often feeling more comfortable or secure with a &ldquo;transitional object,&rdquo; such as a pet or stuffed animal, than with other people.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Affective instability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients can experience repeated and marked mood changes throughout the course of a single day, with moment to moment fluctuations often triggered by environmental stressors. Periods of euthymia can alternate with intense, episodic dysphoria that includes depression, anxiety, and irritability. Angry outbursts triggered by dissatisfaction with a caregiver are often followed by feelings of shame, guilt, and worthlessness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Impulsivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Impetuous and self-damaging behavior is common and can take many forms. Patients abuse substances, binge eat, engage in unsafe sex, spend money irresponsibly, and drive recklessly. In addition, patients can suddenly quit a job that they need or end a relationship that has the potential to last, thereby sabotaging their own success. Impulsivity can also manifest with immature and regressive behavior and often takes the form of sexually acting out. (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI)'</a> below)</p><p>As in nonsuicidal self-injury, impulsivity in the sexual realm can have important utility or meaning to the patient, eg, helping to relieve inner tension or feeling loved following a recent real or perceived interpersonal rejection. Although the patient may be regretful of his or her behavior afterwards and may even appreciate its potential dangerousness, he or she may find it very difficult, if not impossible to resist the urge to repeat the behavior.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Cognition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neuropsychologic functioning in patients with BPD is impaired in many domains.

The patient can usually acknowledge the behavior as a compulsive act that relieves tension, often described as &ldquo;inner tension,&rdquo; and lacks suicidal intent. Nevertheless, self-injurious behavior should be evaluated to determine whether it involves suicidal intent. </p><p>Patients may feel that the relief of tension provided by NSSI prevents them from progressing to suicidal ideation, gestures, or acts. Patients who are told that their therapist will stop seeing them if they continue to self-injure may panic and become more suicidal, particularly if the patient is strongly attached to the therapist. This is not to suggest that the therapist should condone NSSI but rather its meaning to the patient should be explored and influence how action is taken. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3055720651\"><span class=\"h2\">Suicide</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Suicidal threats, gestures, and attempts are common manifestations of BPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Approximately 8 to 12 percent of individuals with BPD have been found to commit suicide in retrospective studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. A comparison of 2384 suicides matched to 46,899 living controls from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink, a primary care database, found a 37-fold increased risk of suicide among patients with BPD compared with patients with no psychiatric disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Data from a prospective longitudinal study of patients with BPD found a lower rate of suicide, 4 percent over a 10-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borderline-personality-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. </p><p>It is not possible to compare the rate of suicide in patients with BPD with suicide rates in the general population or in other diagnostic groups, since no study has produced a standardized mortality ratio (observed <span class=\"nowrap\">deaths/expected</span> deaths) for BPD.</p><p>Assessing the current risk of a patient's suicidal intent is difficult.

(See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Affective instability'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Mood syndromes in bipolar disorder are less connected to events in the environment, compared with the affective instability of BPD that is often triggered by stressors such as perceived rejection or failure.

Problems with self-image and interpersonal relationships characteristic of BPD are not typically part of posttraumatic stress disorder in the absence of personality pathology.

In narcissistic personality disorder, this behavior occurs in the context of a stable, grandiose self-image and without the self-destructive behavior, impulsivity, and fear of abandonment that mark BPD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=narcissistic-personality-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Narcissistic personality disorder: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Paranoid personality disorder</strong> &ndash; Suspiciousness or paranoia, as well as angry reactions to minor stimuli, can occur in both paranoid personality disorder and BPD. Paranoid personality disorder is distinguished by a more pervasive suspiciousness and stable self-image, and lacks the self-destructive behavior, impulsivity, and fear of abandonment that characterize BPD.

Patients with schizotypal personality disorder are more emotionally stable and less impulsive, and their difficulty with relationships stems from odd thinking and strange behavior. In BPD, the psychotic-like episodes are more transient, and the difficulty with relationships is due to affective instability and angry outbursts resulting from abandonment fears and impairments in social cognition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=schizotypal-personality-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Schizotypal personality disorder: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dependent personality disorder</strong> &ndash; The excessive need to be taken care of and fear of abandonment seen in dependent personality disorder leads to increasing appeasement and submissiveness when relationships are threatened, whereas the patient with BPD reacts with rage and feelings of emptiness. In addition, interpersonal relationships of people with dependent personality disorder are more stable than those of people with BPD.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epidemiologic studies have found BPD prevalence rates in the general population to be comparable between women and men; however, the prevalence of BPD in clinical samples is higher in women compared with men. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The etiology of the disorder is unknown. Most hypotheses state that a combination of interacting factors causes BPD, including environmental experiences such as childhood trauma, genetic predisposition, and neurobiological abnormalities. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The core features of BPD are instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affect, as well as marked impulsivity. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suicidality in the form of threats, gestures, and attempts, and nonsuicidal self-injurious behavior, are common in BPD and should be closely monitored. Predicting suicide is very difficult. Approximately 10 percent of patients with BPD in retrospective studies have committed suicide, though prospective studies suggest a somewhat lower percentage. (See <a href=\"#H3055720651\" class=\"local\">'Suicide'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI)'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Suicidal ideation and behavior in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=suicidal-ideation-and-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Suicidal ideation and behavior in children and adolescents: Evaluation and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limited epidemiologic and clinical data suggest that the onset of BPD occurs in adolescence or early adulthood. Diagnosis in adolescents has shown stability, reliability, and validity similar to that of diagnosis in adults. (See <a href=\"#H540945874\" class=\"local\">'Onset'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prospective, longitudinal studies of patients with BPD have found high rates of remission and recurrence, challenging traditional conceptualizations of BPD as chronic and persistent. Follow-along studies have found remission rates of 85 percent to almost 100 percent over 10 to 16 years. Symptomatic remission was associated with later, small improvements in psychosocial functioning. (See <a href=\"#H462913066\" class=\"local\">'Course'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-borderline-personality-disorder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of borderline personality disorder&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of BPD is based on DSM-5 criteria. Diagnosis may be complicated by the presence of co-occurring mood, anxiety, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> substance use disorders, which are seen at higher rates in patients with BPD. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of BPD includes mood disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, dissociative identity disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and other personality disorders. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children or young adolescents are generally not diagnosed with BPD. Traits of the disorder that may appear in childhood can change as these patients reach adulthood. Adolescents with highly severe and pervasive manifestations of the disorder may be most likely to benefit from diagnosis accompanied by early intervention. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3250367789\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We are saddened by the death of Kenneth R Silk, MD, who passed away in April 2016.
