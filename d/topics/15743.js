Perinodal cells, sometimes called transitional or (T) cells, transmit the electrical impulse from the SA node to the right atrium. Each of these cell types has distinct expression profiles of ion channels and gap junctions.</p><p>Given the architecture of the SA node, SA nodal dysfunction typically results from either abnormalities in impulse generation by the P cells or abnormalities in conduction across the T cells. SA nodal dysfunction is more commonly an acquired condition, but in some patients it can be inherited, with gene mutations having been described in some forms of inherited SA nodal dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sinoatrial-nodal-pause-arrest-and-exit-block/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Patients with SA nodal dysfunction may be asymptomatic or highly symptomatic as in cases of sick sinus syndrome. </p><p>Sinoatrial nodal pauses, arrest, and exit block will be discussed here. Additional details regarding the anatomy and electrophysiology of the SA node, as well as a discussion of the sick sinus syndrome, are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sick-sinus-syndrome-epidemiology-etiology-and-natural-history\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sick sinus syndrome: Epidemiology, etiology, and natural history&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1083436\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sinus pause, arrest, and exit block may arise from ischemic, inflammatory, or infiltrative or fibrotic disease of the SA node, excessive vagal tone, sleep apnea, digitalis, and some antiarrhythmic and other drugs. The causes of sinus node dysfunction are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sick-sinus-syndrome-epidemiology-etiology-and-natural-history#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sick sinus syndrome: Epidemiology, etiology, and natural history&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults#H1243945\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obstructive sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Other arrhythmias'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-arrhythmias-due-to-digoxin-toxicity#H13658144\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac arrhythmias due to digoxin toxicity&quot;, section on 'Sinus bradycardia, tachycardia, block, and arrest'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H526693838\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF SA NODAL DYSFUNCTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Sinus pause or arrest</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A sinus pause or arrest is defined as the transient absence of sinus P waves on the electrocardiogram (ECG) that may last from two seconds to several minutes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75018\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef75018 \">waveform 1</a>). This abnormality is an alteration in discharge by the SA pacemaker; as a result, the duration of the pause has no arithmetical relationship to the basic sinus rate (ie, the cycle length of the pause is not a multiple of the basic sinus cycle length as would occur with 2:1 or 3:1 SA nodal block). The pause or arrest often allows escape beats or rhythms to occur, but lower pacemakers may be sluggish or even absent in the sick sinus syndrome.</p><p>A pause that is two seconds and perhaps somewhat longer does not necessarily indicate disease, since it can occur in the normal heart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sinoatrial-nodal-pause-arrest-and-exit-block/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Longer episodes of sinus arrest can produce symptoms of dizziness, presyncope, syncope, and, rarely, death.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">SA nodal exit block</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SA nodal exit block occurs as a result of interference with the delivery of impulses from the SA node to its neighboring atrial tissue. This results in the absence of a P wave on the surface ECG since the P wave is the only manifestation of SA nodal activity. Following the convention for atrioventricular (AV) nodal block, SA nodal exit block can be classified as first, second, or third degree. This problem is most easily conceptualized as having three components:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A relatively constant input &ndash; The input is from the SA nodal pacemaker, which is not seen on the surface ECG. The behavior of the SA nodal pacemaker is, as noted above, inferred from the P waves of atrial activation. The rate or cycle length of the input can be presumed from portions on the ECG where normal P-P cycles are observed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An area across which block occurs &ndash; Exit block is thought to involve the perinodal T cells. The type of exit block in the perinodal tissues must be inferred from the output or response, that is, from the P waves.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An output &ndash; The P wave abnormalities reflect the type of exit block which is present.</p><p/><p>First degree SA nodal exit block reflects a slowing of impulse exit but there is still 1:1 conduction. This abnormality cannot be recognized on the ECG recorded from the body surface.</p><p>Second degree SA nodal exit block has two types:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type I (Wenckebach type) is characterized by progressively decreasing P-P intervals prior to a pause caused by a dropped P wave; the pause has a duration that is less than two P-P cycles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F68081\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef68081 \">waveform 2</a>). The mechanisms of Wenckebach conduction are considered elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=second-degree-atrioventricular-block-mobitz-type-i-wenckebach-block\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Second degree atrioventricular block: Mobitz type I (Wenckebach block)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In type II exit block, the P-P output is an integer multiple of the presumed sinus pacemaker input (eg, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1). Therefore the P-P cycle length surrounding the pause is a multiple of the normal P-P interval (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F54936\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef54936 \">waveform 3</a>).</p><p/><p>Third degree SA nodal exit block prevents sinus node pacemaker impulses from reaching the right atrium. This disorder cannot be distinguished from sinus arrest because the P-wave recorded on the surface ECG is not a direct measure of sinus node activity, only of atrial depolarization (which will be absent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H526693845\"><span class=\"h2\">Variants of SA nodal dysfunction</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H526693852\"><span class=\"h3\">Sinus arrhythmia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sinus arrhythmia is a term that describes small changes in the sinus cycle length. The formal definition of sinus arrhythmia is a variation in the P-P interval by 0.12 sec (120 msec) or more in the presence of normal P waves and the usual PR interval (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73688\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef73688 \">waveform 4</a>), or a difference of 10 percent or greater between the longest and shortest P-P intervals. Sinus arrhythmia is more common in the young and also in those exposed to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a>, while it is less frequently seen in older patients and those with diabetes. Typically, the P wave morphology remains relatively constant, but small variations in the PR interval may be seen. There are two predominant types of sinus arrhythmia, one occurring as a result of normal respiration and another in the presence of digoxin toxicity. Sinus arrhythmia (except when due to digoxin toxicity) is not considered abnormal and rarely causes symptoms; therefore, no treatment is typically recommended. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-sinus-rhythm-and-sinus-arrhythmia#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal sinus rhythm and sinus arrhythmia&quot;, section on 'Sinus arrhythmia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H526693860\"><span class=\"h3\">Wandering atrial pacemaker</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wandering atrial pacemaker refers to a change in the dominant pacemaker focus from the sinus node. A wandering atrial pacemaker is present when there are three or more ectopic foci within the atrial myocardium that serve as the dominant pacemaker (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F54943\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef54943 \">waveform 5</a>). Because the location of the pacemaker changes, the PR interval can vary as well depending on its proximity to the AV node. Wandering pacemaker is not considered pathologic and can often be seen in young, healthy individuals (eg, athletes). Rarely is this symptomatic; therefore, no treatment is typically indicated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-atrial-and-atrioventricular-nodal-supraventricular-arrhythmias#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: Atrial and atrioventricular nodal (supraventricular) arrhythmias&quot;, section on 'Wandering atrial pacemaker'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1083616\"><span class=\"h1\">ELECTROPHYSIOLOGIC AND ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHIC FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mass of the crescent-shaped SA node is too small to create an electrical signal that can be routinely recorded on the surface electrocardiogram (ECG). As a result, we generally infer SA nodal activity from the ECG appearance of the response to that activity (ie, P waves). Although signal-averaged ECGs focusing on the P wave can identify sinus nodal dysfunction, this is not a commonly used clinical tool due in large measure to problems in registration, particularly during a sinus arrhythmia, and because many of the conduction events are transient and are missed by this technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sinoatrial-nodal-pause-arrest-and-exit-block/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Hence, common signs of SA nodal dysfunction on the surface ECG include marked sinus bradycardia that is disproportionate to an individual's metabolic or conditioned state and periods of absent P waves (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F51193\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef51193 \">waveform 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F91605\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef91605 \">waveform 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F91606\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef91606 \">waveform 8</a>). In order to more clearly delineate the mechanism underlying periods of SA nodal dysfunction, electrophysiology studies can be attempted, but these are not commonly performed because understanding the precise mechanism for SA nodal dysfunction very infrequently changes patient management decisions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1083623\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrophysiologic features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SA nodal activity can be recorded using an intracardiac electrode catheter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sinoatrial-nodal-pause-arrest-and-exit-block/abstract/5-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-10</a>]. The following observations were noted in a study of 38 patients with severe symptomatic sick sinus syndrome in whom intracardiac SA nodal electrograms could be recorded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sinoatrial-nodal-pause-arrest-and-exit-block/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nine had complete SA block, unidirectional in seven and bidirectional in two</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>13 had normal 1:1 SA conduction</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nine had second degree SA exit block</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seven patients had no recordable sinus nodal electrogram, which could result from technical failure or from SA nodal quiescence</p><p/><p>Electrophysiologic techniques utilizing both pacing at different rates and extra stimuli can be used to assess several characteristics of SA nodal function, including postpacing escape times, SA nodal recovery time, SA nodal conduction time, SA nodal refractoriness, and the assessment of the &quot;intrinsic&quot; heart rate and other parameters following pharmacologic and autonomic intervention.

This has been termed binodal disease. Electrophysiologic studies suggest that individuals with binodal disease also commonly have intra-atrial conduction disturbances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sinoatrial-nodal-pause-arrest-and-exit-block/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].
