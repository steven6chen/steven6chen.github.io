Most gallbladder cancers are found incidentally in patients undergoing exploration for cholelithiasis. Tumor is found in 0.25 to 3.0 percent of patients undergoing cholecystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. The overall poor prognosis associated with GBC is related to the often advanced stage at diagnosis. For patients with early stage (T1) disease, long-term survival rates range from 85 to 100 percent. Unfortunately, fewer than 10 percent of symptomatic patients and only approximately 20 percent of patients with incidentally diagnosed gallbladder cancer have early-stage disease. </p><p>The surgical management of gallbladder cancer is reviewed here. The clinical evaluation and diagnosis of gallbladder cancer and nonsurgical management of gallbladder cancer are discussed elsewhere. The management of cholangiocarcinoma is reviewed separately.

It is anatomically associated with the anterior abdominal wall and hepatic flexure of the colon.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The body of the gallbladder is attached to the liver by loose connective tissue superiorly. Inferiorly, the free margin abuts the duodenum and transverse colon. Superiorly it is anatomically associated with segments IV and V of the liver (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F81897\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81897 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The neck of the gallbladder extends from the body to the cystic duct.</p><p/><p>The cystic duct joins the common bile duct along its course from the liver to the duodenum. The level of the juncture and course of the cystic duct can vary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F69483\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69483 \">figure 3</a>). </p><p>The gallbladder is supplied by the cystic artery, which is a branch of the right hepatic artery. The cystic artery courses along the cystic duct and divides at the neck of the gallbladder into superficial and deep branches, which supply in the <span class=\"nowrap\">anterior/inferior</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">posterior/superior</span> aspects of the gallbladder, respectively. The cystic artery or an accessory cystic artery can arise from the right hepatic, left hepatic, or common hepatic artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F56280\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56280 \">figure 4</a>). The venous drainage of the gallbladder generally parallels the course of the arteries draining into the cystic vein, which drains into the gallbladder fossa directly into the right hepatic vein (ie, it does not accompany the cystic artery) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F81897\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81897 \">figure 2</a>). </p><p>The sympathetic nerves that supply the gallbladder are derived from the ninth thoracic segment and from the celiac plexus. The phrenic nerve on the right contributes a few somatic fibers.</p><p>The primary function of the gallbladder is the storage of bile, a fluid produced by the liver that aids with the digestion of fat. Bile is released into the duodenum in response to cholecystokinin (CCK), the major hormone responsible for gallbladder contraction and pancreatic enzyme secretion. CCK is produced in discrete endocrine cells that line the mucosa of the small intestine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-cholecystokinin\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of cholecystokinin&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H740004\"><span class=\"h2\">Lymphatic drainage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lymphatic drainage of the gallbladder is via several pathways and does not always follow a predictable drainage pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. In some cases, lymph nodes associated with gallbladder cancer can first be seen posterior to the pancreas or portal vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gallbladder cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'TNM staging system'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cholecysto-retropancreatic pathway is the principal pathway and drains along the cystic duct (cystic nodes), common bile duct (pericholedochal nodes), portal vein (retroportal node), and posterior pancreas (superior retropancreaticoduodenal node) to the paraaortic region (paraaortic nodes). In one study, this route was stained in 95 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cholecysto-celiac pathway, the next most common pathway, drains along the cystic duct (cystic nodes) and medially along the hepatoduodenal ligament posterior to the head of the pancreas to the portal vein and celiac axis. Among lymph nodes along this route, one study found that the posterior common hepatic node was most frequently stained (45 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cholecysto-mesenteric pathway drains to the left in front of the portal vein connecting with the nodes at the root of the mesentery (superior mesenteric nodes).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A hilar route that ascends directly toward the hepatic hilum has been described in an animal model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p/><p>The cystic duct, common bile duct, hepatic artery, and portal vein lymph nodes are considered N1 according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 7 staging manual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The paraaortic, pericaval, superior mesenteric artery, and celiac lymph nodes are N2 nodes that are designated Stage IVb due to the poor prognosis associated with their involvement. Thus, lymphadenectomy is generally not performed beyond the hepatoduodenal ligament. (See <a href=\"#H1159119845\" class=\"local\">'Staging'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H741641\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL SCENARIOS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gallbladder cancer may be diagnosed preoperatively, intraoperatively at the time of surgical exploration for abdominal symptoms attributable to another disease process, or postoperatively upon examination of the gallbladder specimen typically removed for cholecystectomy due to cholelithiasis. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In some cases, gallbladder cancer is diagnosed or suspected preoperatively. Patients with right upper abdominal pain, and particularly those with jaundice or signs of duodenal obstruction, more typically have locally advanced disease that may be identified preoperatively. Risk factors for gallbladder cancer including large gallstones, calcified (porcelain) gallbladder, gallbladder polyps, and congenital biliary cysts among others may point toward a diagnosis of gallbladder cancer preoperatively. The risk factors for gallbladder cancer and diagnostic evaluation are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gallbladder cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with early, invasive, potentially curable gallbladder cancer are often asymptomatic, or may have nonspecific symptoms that mimic, or are due to cholelithiasis or cholecystitis. Because the symptoms are nonspecific, gallbladder cancer is not typically suspected preoperatively. Gallbladder cancer may be identified or strongly suspected at surgical exploration (open or laparoscopic) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/1,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1159124143\" class=\"local\">'Managing an incidental gallbladder cancer'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A common scenario leading to a diagnosis of gallbladder cancer is the return of a final pathology report indicating gallbladder cancer in a resected gallbladder specimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/2,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12,13</a>]. Incidental gallbladder cancer is found in 0.25 to 3.0 percent in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/1-3,12,14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,12,14-17</a>]. The extent of tumor invasion (T-stage) is indicated on the pathology report and may indicate the need for re-resection. In one retrospective study of six major hepatobiliary centers, the majority (92 percent) of patients with incidental gallbladder cancer had T2 (67 percent) and T3 (25 percent) disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Incidentally discovered gallbladder cancer has a high rate of extra-cholecystic disease. In the cohort of patients with incidentally discovered gallbladder cancer who underwent re-resection, 28 patients had evidence of distant hepatic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> peritoneal metastases. (See <a href=\"#H1159119845\" class=\"local\">'Staging'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1159124143\" class=\"local\">'Managing an incidental gallbladder cancer'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1159119845\"><span class=\"h1\">STAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM staging classification of gallbladder cancer is the preferred classification in the United States and is shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F70554\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70554 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Other classification schemes and the distribution of disease by stage are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gallbladder cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Staging'</a>.)</p><p>The risk of distant metastases increases as T stage increases. In one review, peritoneal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> liver metastases were present in 16, 42, and 79 percent of patients with T2, T3, and T4 disease, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Lymphatic metastases are found in 35 to 80 percent of patients with &ge;T2 disease at diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/20-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-24</a>]. Due to advanced disease, 15 to 60 percent of patients are candidates for resection at time of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/11,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,25</a>]. Thus, staging prior to considering resection is important and can be accomplished using a combination of preoperative imaging and diagnostic laparoscopy, which are discussed below. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1159123350\"><span class=\"h2\">Preoperative imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When surgery is being considered in a patient with documented or suspected gallbladder cancer, preoperative imaging is important to identify patients with absolute contraindications to resection. Although preoperative imaging detects extracholecystic disease, it is insensitive for peritoneal disease, which is present in a significant number of patients and requires diagnostic staging laparoscopy for detection. (See <a href=\"#H1159123466\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic staging laparoscopy'</a> below.)</p><p>The incidence of patients undergoing nontherapeutic exploratory laparotomy for locally unresectable malignancy has significantly diminished with high-quality, high-resolution preoperative imaging. However, there are no definitive guidelines for imaging prior to surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/2,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,26</a>]. Cross-sectional imaging can be obtained using multidetector contrast enhanced computed tomography, contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) imaging or MR cholangiopancreatography. In selected cases where metastatic disease is suspected, fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) can be used. Most (86 percent) of gallbladder cancer is FDG-avid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. In a retrospective study of 93 patients with biliary tract cancer who underwent preoperative FDG-PET scans, the results changed the stage and treatment of 24 percent of the patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The sensitivity of these modalities in the diagnosis and staging of gallbladder cancer is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gallbladder cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1159123466\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic staging laparoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnostic staging laparoscopy is necessary prior to resection to identify absolute contraindications that may not be apparent on preoperative imaging studies. (See <a href=\"#H99392790\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications to resection'</a> below.)</p><p>Diagnostic staging laparoscopy frequently identifies metastatic disease or other findings that contraindicate tumor resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/2,11,29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,11,29-31</a>]. As an example, in a large prospective study of 409 patients undergoing staging laparoscopy for gallbladder cancer, 23 percent of patients had disseminated disease (liver surface disease or peritoneal deposits) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The general principles of diagnostic staging laparoscopy for digestive malignancies are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-staging-laparoscopy-general-principles-for-staging-primary-digestive-malignancies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic staging laparoscopy: General principles for staging primary digestive malignancies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Because gallbladder cancer frequently extends directly to adjacent structures such as the liver, stomach, duodenum, pancreas, colon, omentum, or the abdominal wall, diagnostic staging laparoscopy may provide valuable information on extent of disease. Laparoscopic ultrasound should be employed as adjunctive imaging to look for satellite lesions in the liver, define the location of the gallbladder tumor, the relationship of the tumor to surrounding blood vessels, and the likelihood of attaining an adequate margin of liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-staging-laparoscopy-general-principles-for-staging-primary-digestive-malignancies#H22894891\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic staging laparoscopy: General principles for staging primary digestive malignancies&quot;, section on 'Laparoscopic ultrasound'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H99392790\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS TO RESECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Absolute contraindications to surgery for gallbladder cancer include liver metastasis, peritoneal metastases, involvement of N2 nodes (celiac, peripancreatic, periduodenal, or superior mesenteric nodes) malignant ascites, extensive involvement of the hepatoduodenal ligament, and encasement or occlusion of major vessels. If any of these are confirmed preoperatively on imaging studies, the disease is incurable and surgery should only be considered to palliate specific problems. Direct involvement of colon, duodenum, or liver does not represent an absolute contraindication. If no contraindications are identified, a diagnostic laparoscopy is performed prior to resection to confirm the absence of peritoneal or metastatic disease. (See <a href=\"#H1159119845\" class=\"local\">'Staging'</a> above.)</p><p>Patients found to have contraindications to resection based upon preoperative imaging, laparoscopic staging, or intraoperative exploration because of major encasement of vascular structures should be referred for chemotherapy alone or chemoradiotherapy. There is no role for a palliative noncurative radical surgery, for the purpose of debulking, and any subsequent attempts at resection should be undertaken only if it is possible to achieve a complete resection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-advanced-unresectable-gallbladder-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of advanced, unresectable gallbladder cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although the value of a debulking simple cholecystectomy has not been definitely proven in this situation, this approach is recommended by some to prevent future episodes of cholecystitis in patients with locally unresectable disease. The optimal way to manage these patients has not been established, and treatment must be individualized based on extent and resectability of the disease and experience of the management team. (See <a href=\"#H1228877466\" class=\"local\">'Palliative procedures'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H99392019\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery is the only potentially curative therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Gallbladder cancers that are categorized as stage 0, I or II (ie, T stage Tis, T1 or T2) are potentially resectable with curative intent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F70554\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70554 \">table 1</a>). Stage T3 tumors are generally locally unresectable due to vascular invasion or involvement of multiple adjacent organs; however, resection may be possible. Stage IVa (T4, N0-1, M0) is occasionally resectable. Stage IVb, M1, or N2 disease represents unresectable disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallbladder-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gallbladder cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Surgical treatment of gallbladder cancer involves removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) typically with a rim of liver tissue (extended cholecystectomy), except in T1a disease, and may include bile duct resection, lymph node resection, more extensive liver resection, or resection of involved adjacent organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H99392991\"><span class=\"h2\">General approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once intraabdominal metastatic disease has been ruled out with diagnostic laparoscopy, the surgeon can proceed with the resection. (See <a href=\"#H1159123466\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic staging laparoscopy'</a> above.)</p><p>An open rather than laparoscopic procedure is generally recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/35-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-39</a>], although some data suggest the feasibility of a planned laparoscopic approach for an early-stage (T1a) gallbladder cancer, the only group for whom the risk of nodal metastases is sufficiently low that more radical resection can be avoided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F70554\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70554 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. However, preoperative staging is not entirely reliable at identifying patients with T1a disease, and improperly staged tumors are at risk for inadequate resection and subsequent recurrence. In a prospective study, the unresectability of disease was not apparent on staging laparoscopy in 75 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Among these patients, five patients had surface liver metastases, four had deep parenchymal liver metastases, one had peritoneal deposits, 47 had non-locoregional lymph node involvement, and 18 had locally advanced disease. When a laparoscopic approach has been performed, resection of the port sites is advocated by some groups, but is generally not necessary. (See <a href=\"#H111058036\" class=\"local\">'T1 gallbladder cancer'</a> below and <a href=\"#H90813616\" class=\"local\">'Laparoscopic port site resection'</a> below.)</p><p>Open gallbladder surgery is usually performed through a right subcostal incision. Additional exposure can be obtained with extension to the upper midline or to the left subcostal region as a chevron incision. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=incisions-for-open-abdominal-surgery#H3294660\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Incisions for open abdominal surgery&quot;, section on 'Subcostal'</a>.)</p><p>Once the abdomen is entered and retractors are placed, simple cholecystectomy (T1a) or extended cholecystectomy (&gt;T1a) is performed depending on the T stage of the disease. Resection of adherent involved, adjacent organs may be necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1228870938\" class=\"local\">'Cholecystectomy versus extended cholecystectomy'</a> below.)</p><p>Following cholecystectomy or extended cholecystectomy, the specimen is sent for frozen section to evaluate the margins of the specimen. A more extensive liver resection may be needed to achieve negative margins (eg, tumors of the gallbladder neck). A frozen section analysis of the cystic duct stump should also be performed. Cystic duct margin status predicts residual disease in the common bile duct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. If the cystic duct stump is negative for tumor, a regional lymph node dissection is performed (except T1a tumors). On the other hand, if it is positive, then regional lymphadenectomy plus extrahepatic bile duct resection is undertaken. (See <a href=\"#H604313386\" class=\"local\">'Bile duct resection'</a> below and <a href=\"#H604312644\" class=\"local\">'Lymph node dissection'</a> below.)</p><p>For patients in whom the diagnosis of &gt;T1a gallbladder cancer is made incidentally, the surgical management is similar to primary resection of gallbladder cancer (preoperative or intraoperative diagnosis). However, the gallbladder will have already been removed. The status of the cystic duct stump on the pathology report determines the need for lymph node dissection and bile duct resection. (See <a href=\"#H1159124143\" class=\"local\">'Managing an incidental gallbladder cancer'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1228870938\"><span class=\"h2\">Cholecystectomy versus extended cholecystectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whether to perform cholecystectomy alone, or extended cholecystectomy, which resects a rim of liver in the region of the gallbladder bed, is determined largely by the tumor (T) stage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F70554\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70554 \">table 1</a>), once it becomes known. The T-stage may be estimated preoperatively based upon imaging, or determined by intraoperative frozen section analysis or final pathology specimen following cholecystectomy. It is important to remember that preoperative staging (imaging, laparoscopic) is not entirely reliable at identifying patients as having disease limited to the lamina propria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

Re-resection for T1a tumors does not appear to provide an overall survival benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/51-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-54</a>]. </p><p>Patients with stage T1b disease may benefit from a more radical approach, given that T1b tumors are associated with a higher incidence of lymph node metastases compared with T1a tumors (15 versus 2.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/41,42,44,55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42,44,55-57</a>]. Some investigators have shown a median survival advantage of over three years for extended versus cholecystectomy alone for T1b cancers (9.85 versus 6.42 years, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Extended cholecystectomy (cholecystectomy including a rim of liver tissue) should be performed for medically-fit patients who have tumors that invade the muscular layer (T1b) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F70554\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70554 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H966253\" class=\"local\">'Extended cholecystectomy'</a> below.)</p><p>The optimal approach to T1b disease is more controversial. If there is no contraindication to surgery, extended resection is reasonable for T1b gallbladder cancer. At least two retrospective studies comparing cholecystectomy alone versus extended cholecystectomy for T1b tumors found no significant difference in overall survival (with up to 87 percent 10<strong>-</strong>year survival). Others have reported improved survival with re-resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Furthermore, a number of studies describe high rates of residual disease upon re-resection, with lymph node metastases in 12 to 20 percent and 0 to 13 percent with liver involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/18,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,23</a>].

The authors of both reports concluded that gallbladder cancer is a locally aggressive disease and even early-stage disease warrants extended resection. Finally, as noted above, decision analysis showed a median survival advantage of over three years for extended versus simple cholecystectomy (9.85 versus 6.42 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H111058043\"><span class=\"h3\">T2 gallbladder cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extended cholecystectomy should also be performed in patients with T2 tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/53,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,61</a>]. The need to perform a more aggressive resection is supported by the high rate of residual disease discovered on re-resection for T2 disease discovered incidentally. In a retrospective study of six major hepatobiliary centers, upon re-resection of T2 tumors found incidentally, residual disease was found in 57 percent of the patients at any site; lymph nodes were involved in 31 percent, and the liver was involved in 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Lymph node metastases have been seen in up to 62 percent of patients with T2 disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Given the high rate of residual disease seen after re-resection of T2 disease, it is not surprising that high rates of positive margins (11 out of 25 with positive margins in one study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>], and high rates of local recurrence (40 percent) are found in patients with T2 treated with cholecystectomy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. </p><p>For patients with an incidentally detected T2 tumor on histologic review of the cholecystectomy specimen, reexploration and extended cholecystectomy are also indicated. Reexploration identifies residual tumor in 40 to 76 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/1,20,22,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,20,22,41,42</a>], a high likelihood of liver involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>], and nodal metastases with T2 disease. Re-resection significantly increases the likelihood of long-term disease-free survival in patients with T2 disease. In many series, five-year survival rates increased from 24 to 40 percent to 80 to 100 percent with aggressive surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/19,20,22,41,42,45,55,56,66-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20,22,41,42,45,55,56,66-70</a>]. </p><p>As an example, in an analysis of 3209 patients with early-stage gallbladder cancer (12 percent Tis, 30 percent T1, 58 percent T2) derived from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, extended resection with lymph node excision was associated with increased survival compared with cholecystectomy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. However, a significant survival advantage for extended resection was seen only in patients with<sup> </sup>T2 lesions (hazard ratio [HR] 0.49, 95% CI 0.35-0.68). Lymph node excision also significantly improved<sup> </sup>survival in patients with T2 lesions and was related to the number of lymph nodes removed (HR 0.42, 95% CI 0.33-0.53 for one to four<sup> </sup>lymph nodes excised; HR 0.26, CI 0.16-0.42 for five lymph nodes excised). Based upon these survival differences, one report suggests that for gallbladder cancer to be considered node negative, at least six lymph nodes should have been removed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1228870927\"><span class=\"h3\">Resectable T3/4 or node positive gallbladder cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the past, surgeons were reluctant to operate on patients with locally advanced <span class=\"nowrap\">(T3/4)</span> disease because of an overall poor prognosis.

A median survival time of 17 months with a 2 percent mortality rate has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. Although long-term survivors are reported, morbidity and mortality rates are high (48 to 54, and 15 to 18 percent, respectively).</p><p>For patients with regional nodal (N1 disease, limited to cystic, portal, and portocaval nodes) involvement, five-year survival rates from 28 to 60 percent are reported with radical resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/41,74,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,74,80</a>].

If preoperative fine needle aspiration confirms involvement of N2 nodes, the patient is not curable; thus, surgery should be performed only for palliation of specific problems.

Most gallbladder cancers were T2 or higher and positive lymph nodes were found in 21 and 44 percent of the re-resected patients and T2 with T3 tumors.

Although re-resection is associated with additional risk, improvements in perioperative care and operative technique have decreased perioperative morbidity and mortality associated with major liver surgery in high-volume centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/32,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,87</a>]. </p><p>The optimal timing of the reoperation was the subject of a multi-institution, retrospective analysis from the US Extrahepatic Biliary Malignancy Consortium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. Of the 207 patients who required reoperations for incidentally discovered gallbladder cancer, those who underwent reoperations between four and eight weeks from the date of the original cholecystectomy had better overall survival (median 40.4, 95% CI 16.4 to 64.4 months) than those who underwent reoperations either before four weeks (median 17.4, 95% CI 11.1 to 23.7 months) or after eight weeks (median 22.4, 95% CI 18.2 to 26.6 months). Possible biologic explanations include that reoperating between four and eight weeks permits reduced inflammation and full appreciation of subclinical diseases (compared with reoperating &lt;4 weeks) but does not allow too much time for disease dissemination (compared with reoperating &gt;8 weeks). Given the retrospective nature of this study, the results may be biased by confounders that are not controlled for and should ideally be validated in a randomized trial.

A formal central liver resection may be appropriate depending upon the location of the tumor (fundus, body, neck). </p><p>The margin of liver to be resected can be scored superficially (around the gallbladder and gallbladder mass) with electrocautery to a depth of a couple of millimeters, or sutures can be placed at each side of the margin of resection with absorbable sutures on a blunt needle to mark the margin of resection. The gallbladder, tumor, and margin of liver are resected in a single en bloc specimen.

The pattern of drainage of the gallbladder veins may provide support for anatomic <span class=\"nowrap\">IVb/V</span> resection over nonanatomic resection.

However, several retrospective series have not shown a survival benefit for this approach in the management of gallbladder cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/2,18,102,103\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,18,102,103</a>]. Opponents of routine bile duct resection also cite the risk of potential, serious complications of hepaticojejunostomy, such as bile leak and anastomotic stricture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/84,102\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,102</a>]. Further supporting this view, a retrospective study found that common duct resection does not necessarily yield a greater lymph node count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>Although the bile ducts do not need to be resected when the cystic duct margin is negative, the ducts may be compromised during skeletonization of the porta hepatis. If the ducts appear ischemic or otherwise injured, resection and reconstruction will become necessary. </p><p>Intra-abdominal drains should be placed following resection and reconstruction of the extrahepatic bile ducts if oozing persists or bile leak is anticipated. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H604312644\"><span class=\"h2\">Lymph node dissection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lymph node dissection is indicated whether or not bile duct resection is performed if the gallbladder cancer is &gt;T1a. In many cases, lymph node involvement is not obvious intraoperatively, and thus, even normal appearing nodes should be removed. Lymphatic metastases are found in 35 to 80 percent of patients with gallbladder tumors that invade the perimuscular connective tissue (&ge;T2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/5,20-24,81,104\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,20-24,81,104</a>], and are one of the best predictors of a poor outcome after surgery (five-year survival of 57 percent without versus 12 percent with lymph node metastases) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. However, the optimal extent of the lymphadenectomy is controversial. </p><p>A D1 lymphadenectomy removes N1 lymph nodes that are contained within the hepatic pedicle and the hepatoduodenal ligament (cystic artery, hepatic artery, portal vein, and common bile duct). A D2 lymphadenectomy also removes N2 lymph nodes that include the periaortic, celiac artery, superior mesenteric artery, and inferior vena cava nodes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F70554\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70554 \">table 1</a>). In one report, D1 and D2 lymphadenectomies for gallbladder cancer removed, on average, three and eight lymph nodes, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>].

When lymphatic metastases are limited to N1 nodes, five-year survival rates range from 15 to 60 percent with extended cholecystectomy and lymph node resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/74,80,105\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,80,105</a>]. Involvement of the N2 nodes, however, is associated with significantly worse prognosis with few long-term survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-gallbladder-cancer/abstract/22,56,76,80,105\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,56,76,80,105</a>].</p><p>Because an extended lymphadenectomy allows for better prognostic stratification of patients, we suggest that surgeons perform a D2 rather than a D1 lymphadenectomy for gallbladder cancer when it can be performed without substantially increasing postoperative complications (eg, without needing to perform a pancreaticoduodenectomy).

Surgical series report long-term survival rates of 85 to 100 percent for patients with early-stage (T1) disease. Unfortunately, fewer than 10 percent of symptomatic patients and only approximately 20 percent of patients with incidentally diagnosed gallbladder cancer have early-stage disease. The poor prognosis associated with GBC is related to the often advanced stage at diagnosis.

A right hepatic lobectomy may be appropriate in selected patients (eg, tumor of the gallbladder neck, tumor involving the right portal triad).
