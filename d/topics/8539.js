It can occur in the fasting or postprandial state. In any case of hypoglycemia, regardless of the cause, the diagnosis can usually be established by appropriate blood tests at the time of the spontaneous occurrence of hypoglycemia, if such an event occurs in the presence of medical personnel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F73797\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73797 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>If the patient is not symptomatic when seen, the diagnostic strategy is to replicate conditions in which hypoglycemia would be expected if a hypoglycemic disorder exists. A prolonged supervised fast, which can last as long as 72 hours, has been the best established and probably most reliable test for the evaluation of hypoglycemia occurring in the food-deprived state. For patients with postprandial hypoglycemia, however, a mixed-meal test is the preferred provocative procedure.</p><p>This topic will review the approach to the nondiabetic patient with hypoglycemia. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and causes of hypoglycemia, in general, are discussed separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F78919\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78919 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F52892\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52892 \">table 3</a>). The evaluation and management of hypoglycemia in patients with drug-treated diabetes mellitus is also reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypoglycemia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-definition-and-causes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypoglycemia in adults: Clinical manifestations, definition, and causes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-dilemmas-in-hypoglycemia-illustrative-cases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic dilemmas in hypoglycemia: Illustrative cases&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hypoglycemia-during-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hypoglycemia during treatment of diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CANDIDATES FOR EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of a hypoglycemic disorder in a person without diabetes should not be suspected solely on the basis of a low plasma glucose concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-without-diabetes-mellitus-diagnostic-approach/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>], as this observation is necessary but insufficient for a diagnosis and, in some cases, may be misleading. Only those patients in whom Whipple's triad is documented require evaluation and management of hypoglycemia. Given documentation of Whipple's triad, detailed laboratory evaluation is usually required in a healthy-appearing patient, whereas hypoglycemia may be readily recognized as part of the underlying illness or its treatment (or <span class=\"nowrap\">prescribing/dispensing</span> error) in an ill or medicated patient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F78919\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78919 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypoglycemia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-definition-and-causes#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypoglycemia in adults: Clinical manifestations, definition, and causes&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Whipple's triad includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms consistent with hypoglycemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A low plasma glucose concentration measured with a precise method (not a home glucose monitor) when symptoms are present</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relief of those symptoms after the plasma glucose level is raised</p><p/><p>The association of symptoms reinforces the biologic significance of the low blood glucose. Furthermore, healthy individuals may have low glucose concentrations without symptoms after prolonged fasting. In addition, sympathoadrenal and neuroglycopenic symptoms may be highly suggestive of hypoglycemia, but they cannot be ascribed to hypoglycemia with confidence unless the glucose concentration is low at the same time. Normal glucose concentrations measured when the patient is free of those symptoms does not exclude the possibility of hypoglycemia at the time of those earlier symptoms. Thus, it is important to confirm the presence of a hypoglycemic disorder before performing various tests to determine the etiology of hypoglycemia. Documentation of Whipple's triad helps to establish the existence of a hypoglycemic disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-without-diabetes-mellitus-diagnostic-approach/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Hypoglycemia is sometimes detected serendipitously. A low plasma glucose concentration in the absence of symptoms of hypoglycemia suggests the possibility of artifactual hypoglycemia. However, a distinctly low plasma glucose concentration measured in a reliable laboratory cannot be ignored. The measurement should be repeated using a collection tube that contains an inhibitor of glycolysis, and processing should not be delayed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypoglycemia-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-definition-and-causes#H18546202\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypoglycemia in adults: Clinical manifestations, definition, and causes&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Although low blood glucose values measured using reflectance meters suggest the presence of hypoglycemia, these methods are not reliable to diagnose hypoglycemia in the absence of diabetes treated with a medication such as insulin or a sulfonylurea that can cause hypoglycemia. Thus, a patient who has a single low blood glucose value measured by a meter but no symptoms of hypoglycemia probably does not need further evaluation; on the other hand, evaluation is indicated in a patient who has repeated low values.</p><p>Patients who have only sympathoadrenal symptoms but normal concurrent plasma glucose concentrations have a low probability of having a hypoglycemic disorder and do not require a comprehensive evaluation for a hypoglycemic disorder. This combination is most common in patients with postprandial symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postprandial-reactive-hypoglycemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postprandial (reactive) hypoglycemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our approach to the evaluation and management of hypoglycemia in nondiabetic adults is outlined below. Because hypoglycemic disorders are uncommon in persons without diabetes, this approach is largely based upon clinical experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-without-diabetes-mellitus-diagnostic-approach/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. It is consistent with the 2009 Endocrine Society guidelines for the evaluation and management of hypoglycemic disorders in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-without-diabetes-mellitus-diagnostic-approach/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step is to review the patient's history in detail, including the nature and timing of symptoms (particularly in relationship to meals), existence of underlying illnesses or conditions, medications taken by the individual and by family members, and social history. Clinical evidence for adrenal insufficiency or nonislet cell tumor should be considered. In a patient with documented hypoglycemia, the cause may be apparent from the history and physical examination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F78919\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78919 \">table 2</a>). In a seemingly well individual, the cause is less apparent and may be due to hyperinsulinism or factitious hypoglycemia. When the cause of hypoglycemia is not evident, detailed laboratory evaluation is needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of a hypoglycemic disorder in a person without diabetes should not be inferred solely on the basis of a low plasma glucose concentration, unless the value is severely depressed (&lt;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [2.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span>. To rule out artifactual hypoglycemia in such cases, the measurement should be repeated using a collection tube that contains an inhibitor of glycolysis, and processing should not be delayed. </p><p>The purpose of the initial laboratory evaluation is to document Whipple's triad [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-without-diabetes-mellitus-diagnostic-approach/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Should Whipple's triad have been demonstrated previously, the goal of testing is to assess the role of insulin in the genesis of the hypoglycemia.</p><p>If the patient is not symptomatic when seen, the diagnostic strategy is to seek Whipple's triad under conditions in which hypoglycemia would be expected if a hypoglycemic disorder exists. In a patient who presents with a self-diagnosis of hypoglycemia, one strategy is to measure plasma glucose concentrations at the time of symptoms and then decide if the glucose values and the history are sufficiently suggestive to warrant additional evaluation. If the symptoms occur primarily in the fasting state, that evaluation should be performed during a fast (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Fasting evaluation'</a> below). However, if there is a compelling history of postprandial symptoms, it is reasonable to seek Whipple's triad with frequent, timed plasma glucose measurements and recording of any symptoms after a mixed meal. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Postprandial evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients who are fortuitously observed during an episode of symptoms and are found to have hypoglycemia at that time should have the following blood tests (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F73797\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73797 \">table 1</a>) :</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glucose</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insulin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>C-peptide</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHOB)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proinsulin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sulfonylurea and meglitinide screen</p><p/><p>The interpretation of these results is shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F56314\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56314 \">table 4</a>) and described below. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Interpretation of data'</a> below and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Determining the cause of hypoglycemia'</a> below.)</p><p>In patients with endogenous hyperinsulinism, insulin antibodies should be measured to distinguish insulin autoimmune hypoglycemia from other causes of hyperinsulinism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F78919\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78919 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F56314\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56314 \">table 4</a>). Insulin antibodies do not need to be drawn during hypoglycemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Fasting evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are patients in whom symptoms occur after only a short period of food withdrawal. In such patients, continued observation in the office or clinic, especially if they have fasted overnight, may result in an episode of symptomatic hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-without-diabetes-mellitus-diagnostic-approach/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Plasma glucose should be measured repeatedly during the period of observation. If symptoms occur and hypoglycemia is documented (plasma glucose &lt;55 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]),</span> the other tests described above should be performed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F56314\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56314 \">table 4</a>). The results may obviate the need for a provocative test, such as the 72-hour fast.</p><p>If this approach causes neither symptoms nor hypoglycemia and if clinical suspicion remains high, the patient should undergo a 72-hour fast. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'72-hour fast'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Postprandial evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If symptoms of hypoglycemia typically occur within five hours after eating, patients should be evaluated in the postprandial state (mixed-meal test).</p><p>For a mixed-meal diagnostic test, the patient consumes a non-liquid meal that usually leads to symptoms and is then observed for up to five hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-without-diabetes-mellitus-diagnostic-approach/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Samples are collected for plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin prior to ingestion of the meal and every 30 minutes thereafter for five hours. If severe symptoms occur prior to five hours, samples for the above lab tests should be collected before the administration of carbohydrates (to assess for correction of symptoms). All glucose samples are sent for analysis. The samples for insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin should be analyzed only in those samples in which plasma glucose is &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. If Whipple's triad is demonstrated, sulfonylureas, meglitinides, and antibodies to insulin should also be measured.</p><p>Standards for the interpretation of the mixed-meal test are not established. Thus, the interpretation of the test results is the same as when the tests are done during a spontaneous episode of hypoglycemia or during a 72-hour fast (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F56314\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56314 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Interpretation of data'</a> below.)</p><p>An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) or a meal that is solely in liquid form (eg, Ensure) done in an effort to replicate postprandial symptoms should not be performed, because misleading results may be obtained, particularly in patients with prior upper gastrointestinal surgery and disordered gastric emptying in whom a liquid meal may precipitate dumping syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-without-diabetes-mellitus-diagnostic-approach/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postprandial-reactive-hypoglycemia#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postprandial (reactive) hypoglycemia&quot;, section on 'Postprandial syndrome'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">72-hour fast</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The purpose of the 72-hour fast is to provoke the homeostatic responses that keep blood glucose concentrations from falling to concentrations that cause symptoms in the absence of food. Increased release of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glucagon</a>, epinephrine, and, to a lesser degree, growth hormone and cortisol are the most important components of this response. All the hormonal responses begin well before the onset of symptomatic hypoglycemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiologic response to hypoglycemia in normal subjects and patients with diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Normal subjects do not have symptomatic hypoglycemia after a prolonged fast, because of a hormonally mediated increase in glucose production. Gluconeogenesis accounts for approximately 50 percent of glucose production after an overnight fast and for almost all glucose production after 42 hours or more of fasting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-without-diabetes-mellitus-diagnostic-approach/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The prolonged fast will result in hypoglycemia only if there is a defect in the ability to maintain normoglycemia due, for example, to an excess of insulin, which inhibits endogenous glucose production, as well as the transition to alternate sources of fuel and subsequent ketone production. The defect should be identifiable if appropriate testing is performed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F56314\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56314 \">table 4</a>).

A careful record should be kept of exactly what was done, what blood samples were taken, what was to be measured in each blood sample, and what symptoms occurred. It is equally important that the blood samples and laboratory slips be carefully labeled, particularly with the exact time, and that the labeling information be recorded on a flow sheet. Later interpretation of the results is possible only with this detail.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Date the onset of the fast at the time of the last intake of calories.

Because of possible delays in the availability of the results of plasma glucose testing, a bedside reflectance meter may have to be used to measure blood glucose when frequent samples are obtained. However, the decision to end the fast should not be made on the basis of a fingerstick blood glucose value. It is essential that the clinician determine in advance the correct tubes to use for the blood samples and the correct procedures for handling and processing the samples.</p><p/><p>Although blood is collected repeatedly, we measure insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin only in those specimens in which the plasma glucose concentration is &le;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>.</p><p>Insulin antibodies should be measured, but they do not have to be measured during hypoglycemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h4\">Test endpoints and duration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The fast is ended when the plasma glucose concentration is &le;45 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> the patient has symptoms or signs of hypoglycemia, 72 hours have elapsed, or when the plasma glucose concentration is less than 55 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> if Whipple's triad was documented on a prior occasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-without-diabetes-mellitus-diagnostic-approach/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Fasting for a maximum of 72 hours has been the standard test for the diagnosis of insulinoma. A 48-hour maximum has been proposed as a simpler alternative based upon a report of 127 patients with insulinoma in which adequate information was obtained for diagnosis in all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-without-diabetes-mellitus-diagnostic-approach/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The fast was terminated because of hypoglycemia (plasma glucose &le;45 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> in 43 percent by 12 hours, 67 percent by 24 hours, and 95 percent by 48 hours.</p><p>However, in our series of 205 patients with insulinoma, 14 percent did not develop Whipple's triad until after 48 hours of fasting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-without-diabetes-mellitus-diagnostic-approach/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Thus, to avoid misdiagnosis, we recommend the standard 72-hour fast.</p><p>The decision to end the fast may not be easy. Some patients have slightly low plasma glucose values but no symptoms or signs of hypoglycemia, while others have the same symptoms during fasting that they have in ordinary life at a time when plasma glucose values are normal. In the latter patients, the symptoms cannot be attributed to hypoglycemia. To complicate matters further, young, lean, healthy women may have plasma glucose concentrations in the range of 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> or even lower after prolonged periods of fasting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-without-diabetes-mellitus-diagnostic-approach/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Careful questioning and testing for subtle symptoms or signs of hypoglycemia should be conducted repeatedly when the patient's plasma glucose is near or in the hypoglycemic range. Simple tests of cognitive function may be indicated. To end the fast solely on the basis of a low plasma glucose value (except in those patients who have had Whipple's triad documented previously), in the absence of symptoms or signs of hypoglycemia, jeopardizes the possibility of discriminating between normal persons and those with hypoglycemia not mediated by insulin. A low plasma glucose value is a necessary but not sufficient finding for the diagnosis of hypoglycemia.</p><p>The absence of symptoms or signs of hypoglycemia and lack of a low plasma glucose concentration during a 72-hour fast indicates a normal 72-hour fast but does not preclude the existence of a hypoglycemic disorder that causes only postprandial symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h4\">Ending the fast</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three steps are performed at the end of the fast:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Collect samples for plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin, BHOB, and oral hypoglycemic agents</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>1 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glucagon</a> is given intravenously and the plasma glucose measured 10, 20, and 30 minutes later</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient is fed</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Interpretation of data</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interpretation of the data obtained at the end of the 72-hour fast is the same as that performed during the occurrence of a spontaneous hypoglycemic episode or during a postprandial evaluation (mixed-meal test) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F56314\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56314 \">table 4</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-without-diabetes-mellitus-diagnostic-approach/abstract/5,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9</a>].

As a result, patients with insulin-mediated hypoglycemia respond to 1 mg of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glucagon</a> (a potent glycogenolytic agent) by releasing glucose. Normal subjects will have released virtually all glucose from the liver at the end of the 72-hour fast and cannot therefore respond as vigorously to intravenous glucagon as a patient with an insulinoma. At the end of the fast, patients with an insulinoma have an increase in plasma glucose of 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> or more in 20 to 30 minutes, whereas normal subjects have a smaller increment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F64700\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64700 \">figure 5</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Determining the cause of hypoglycemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By observing the presence of symptoms and signs of hypoglycemia and by making the above biochemical measurements, it is usually possible to distinguish among the various causes of hypoglycemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F78919\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78919 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-without-diabetes-mellitus-diagnostic-approach/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>A lower plasma BHOB value and a vigorous plasma glucose response to intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glucagon</a> point to hypoglycemia mediated by insulin or an insulin-like factor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F56314\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56314 \">table 4</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plasma insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin values are elevated in patients with insulinoma, oral hypoglycemia agent-induced hypoglycemia, and insulin autoimmune hypoglycemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Sulfonylurea or meglitinides are present in the plasma only in oral hypoglycemic agent-induced hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-without-diabetes-mellitus-diagnostic-approach/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Insulin autoimmune hypoglycemia occurs in patients who have antibodies directed to endogenous insulin or to the insulin receptor. Symptoms can occur postprandially, fasting, or in both states. In patients with insulin autoantibodies, it is presumed that insulin secreted in response to a meal binds to the antibody and then disassociates in an unregulated fashion causing hyperinsulinemia and hypoglycemia. In patients with antibodies to the insulin receptor, hypoglycemia occurs as a result of antibody activation of the receptor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plasma insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin values are also elevated in patients with noninsulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycemia syndrome (NIPHS). NIPHS is endogenous hyperinsulinemia due to islet hypertrophy and nesidioblastosis, a form of primary islet cell hypertrophy with neodifferentiation of islet of Langerhans cells from pancreatic duct epithelium. An unusual feature of this disorder is that hypoglycemia occurs postprandially, two to four hours after a meal. Fasting hypoglycemia, characteristic of insulinoma, is rare in this disorder. Nesidioblastosis has also been described in patients with post-gastric bypass hypoglycemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninsulinoma-pancreatogenous-hypoglycemia-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninsulinoma pancreatogenous hypoglycemia syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plasma insulin values are high in patients with exogenous insulin administration, whereas plasma C-peptide and proinsulin values are low. In hypoglycemia caused by synthetic insulin analogs (eg, glargine, detemir, lispro, aspart), insulin concentrations may be low, depending upon the insulin assay used. Clinical suspicion should guide subsequent testing of the sample obtained at the time of hypoglycemia against a panel of antibodies to insulin capable of detecting various analogs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=factitious-hypoglycemia#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Factitious hypoglycemia&quot;, section on 'Exogenous insulin'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plasma insulin, C-peptide, and proinsulin concentrations are not elevated in patients with nonislet cell tumors. Nonislet cell tumors can cause hypoglycemia via a number of mechanisms not related to hypersecretion of insulin, including tumor production of insulin-like growth factor-II or more often its precursor, and tumor burden in which the tumor cell's high metabolic needs and reduced hepatic glycogen stores are thought to be responsible for hypoglycemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonislet-cell-tumor-hypoglycemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonislet cell tumor hypoglycemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of primary hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Hypoglycemia'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">LOCALIZING STUDIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Localizing studies should not be performed until endogenous insulin-mediated hypoglycemia has been demonstrated. In patients with endogenous insulin-mediated hypoglycemia, the differential diagnosis includes insulinoma, <span class=\"nowrap\">nesidioblastosis/islet-cell</span> hypertrophy, oral hypoglycemic agent-induced hypoglycemia, and insulin autoimmune hypoglycemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F78919\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78919 \">table 2</a>). Negative results for circulating oral hypoglycemic agents and insulin antibodies effectively rule out oral hypoglycemic agent-induced hypoglycemia and insulin autoimmune hypoglycemia, respectively. A localizing study is required in all patients with insulin-mediated hypoglycemia, except those with positive results for insulin antibodies or circulating oral hypoglycemic agents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiologic studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and transabdominal ultrasonography can detect most insulinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-without-diabetes-mellitus-diagnostic-approach/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. The choice of procedure depends upon which tests are available and local radiologic skill. Transabdominal ultrasonography is our preferred initial test. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulinoma#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Insulinoma&quot;, section on 'Tumor localization'</a>.)</p><p>A negative imaging study does not exclude insulinoma.

We reserve this test for complex cases of endogenous hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia and negative radiologic localization studies.</p><p>This test involves selective injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium gluconate</a> into the gastroduodenal, splenic, and superior mesenteric arteries with subsequent sampling of the hepatic venous effluent for insulin. A positive result is at least a doubling or tripling of basal insulin concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-without-diabetes-mellitus-diagnostic-approach/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The increase in insulin occurs in samples from the artery supplying the region with hyperfunctioning islets, either an insulinoma or islet hypertrophy, which facilitates operative localization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-adults-without-diabetes-mellitus-diagnostic-approach/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Understanding the local variation in pancreatic arterial anatomy is important for appropriate regionalization.</p><p>In patients with insulinoma, the response is positive in one artery alone unless the tumor resides in a &quot;watershed&quot; area fed by two arteries or the patient has multiple insulinomas scattered throughout the pancreas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F77814\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77814 \">table 5</a>).
