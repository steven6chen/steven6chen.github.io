The clinical features and diagnostic criteria are discussed elsewhere in this topic. (See <a href=\"#H56442671\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=somatic-symptom-disorder-assessment-and-diagnosis#H2086647606\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Somatic symptom disorder: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic criteria'</a>.)</p><p>The DSM-5 diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder has largely consolidated and supplanted the diagnoses of somatization disorder, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, hypochondriasis, and pain disorder, which were included in the prior edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (Fourth Edition, Text Revision; DSM-IV-TR) and were collectively referred to as somatoform disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/somatic-symptom-disorder-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The somatoform disorders were eliminated in DSM-5.</p><p>Most of the patients who previously received the DSM-IV-TR somatoform diagnoses are now diagnosed in DSM-5 with somatic symptom disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/somatic-symptom-disorder-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. As an example, the term hypochondriasis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F68413\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68413 \">table 1</a>) in DSM-IV-TR described patients who misinterpreted one or more bodily symptoms and believed that they had a serious disease or were preoccupied with fear of a disease, despite appropriate medical evaluation and reassurance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/somatic-symptom-disorder-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Among patients previously diagnosed with hypochondriasis, it is estimated that approximately 75 percent are subsumed under the DSM-5 diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder (if physical complaints are prominent) and 25 percent under the DSM-5 diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder (if physical complaints are minimal or nonexistent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/somatic-symptom-disorder-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Support for these estimates include a retrospective study of patients who initially received a DSM-IV diagnosis of hypochondriasis (n = 58); post-hoc application of DSM-5 criteria found that 76 percent met criteria for somatic symptom disorder and 24 percent met criteria for illness anxiety disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/somatic-symptom-disorder-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Additional information about illness anxiety disorder, including its diagnostic criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F104206\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104206 \">table 2</a>), is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=illness-anxiety-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Illness anxiety disorder: Epidemiology, clinical presentation, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A review by the workgroup that developed the DSM-5 diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder found that the construct, descriptive, and predictive validity of somatic symptom disorder were superior to the validity of the DSM-IV somatoform disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/somatic-symptom-disorder-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, inter-rater and test-retest reliability for somatic symptom disorder are good to very good. </p><p>Although the diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder has been criticized as overinclusive and fraught with the potential for false positives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/somatic-symptom-disorder-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], it appears that somatic symptom disorder may be a more restrictive diagnosis than the DSM-IV-TR somatoform diagnoses that it replaced. A study of patients with symptoms that were deemed &ldquo;medically unexplained&rdquo; (n = 325) found that twice as many patients fulfilled diagnostic criteria for a somatoform disorder than for somatic symptom disorder (93 versus 46 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/somatic-symptom-disorder-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In addition, the diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder requires that patients exhibit excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to the somatic symptoms, and thus identifies a group with greater mental impairment, compared with somatoform disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/somatic-symptom-disorder-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>The DSM-IV-TR somatoform disorders included the criterion that somatic symptoms were medically unexplained. However, the reliability for medically unexplained symptoms is poor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/somatic-symptom-disorder-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8</a>] because it is difficult to prove that a symptom is medically unexplained (prove a negative) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/somatic-symptom-disorder-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. By contrast, DSM-5 somatic symptom disorder can be diagnosed in patients with known general medical disorders.</p><p>DSM-5 includes somatic symptom disorder in the category called somatic symptom and related disorders, which are diagnoses characterized by prominent somatic concerns, distress, and impaired functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/somatic-symptom-disorder-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Patients with somatic symptom and related disorders typically present to primary care clinicians and general medical specialists rather than psychiatrists. </p><p>The World Health Organization&rsquo;s International Classification of Diseases &ndash; 10th Revision (ICD-10) still retains the term &ldquo;somatoform disorders&rdquo; as a category, as well as the specific diagnoses of somatization disorder, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, hypochondriacal disorder, and persistent somatoform pain disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/somatic-symptom-disorder-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3058265287\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2999052590\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of somatic symptom disorder is unclear because it was introduced as a diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), which was published in 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/somatic-symptom-disorder-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Somatic symptom disorder was derived in part from the somatoform disorders (diagnoses such as somatization disorder and hypochondriasis), which were eliminated from DSM-5. Most of the patients who previously received the somatoform diagnoses are now diagnosed in DSM-5 with somatic symptom disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/somatic-symptom-disorder-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] (see <a href=\"#H3235178637\" class=\"local\">'Terminology and DSM-5'</a> above). Thus, estimates about the prevalence of somatic symptom disorder comes from the literature on somatoform disorders. In addition, prevalence estimates for somatic symptom disorder draw upon studies of &ldquo;somatization,&rdquo; which is a broad construct that has been used to describe patients with medically unexplained symptoms that cause distress and impairment, but is not a formal diagnosis in DSM-5. </p><p>Multiple studies suggest that somatic symptom disorder is common and occurs most often in primary care patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/somatic-symptom-disorder-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/1,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10</a>]. The prevalence of somatic symptom disorder can be approximated as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/somatic-symptom-disorder-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>General population</strong> &ndash; 4 to 6 percent. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This estimate is based upon a community survey in the United States, which defined somatization as four or more unexplained physical symptoms in men and six or more unexplained physical symptoms in women; the study found that the lifetime prevalence of somatization in was 4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/somatic-symptom-disorder-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. In addition, a review and reanalysis of community survey data from six studies estimated that the 12-month prevalence of somatoform disorders in the general population of Europe was approximately 6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/somatic-symptom-disorder-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Primary care patients</strong> &ndash; 17 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This estimate is based upon a review of six primary care studies, which defined somatization as four or more unexplained physical symptoms in men and six or more unexplained physical symptoms in women; the median point prevalence of somatization was 17 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/somatic-symptom-disorder-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/11,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,14</a>]. </p><p/><p>Prevalence rates of somatic symptom disorder are probably higher in patients with functional disorders such as fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, and chronic fatigue syndrome (also known as systemic exertion intolerance disease). As an example, a study of 156 patients with fibromyalgia found that somatic symptom disorder (diagnosed according to DSM-5 criteria) was present in more than 25 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/somatic-symptom-disorder-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Little is known about the age of onset for somatic symptom disorder.

Consistent with this is a community study of adolescents, which found that persistent distressing somatic symptoms, combined with psychological concerns, were present in 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/somatic-symptom-disorder-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H784473854\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based upon studies of somatoform disorders and somatization, likely risk factors for somatic symptoms disorder include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/somatic-symptom-disorder-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/1,11,16,18-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11,16,18-25</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Female sex</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fewer years of education</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower socioeconomic status or other social stressors</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of childhood chronic illness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of sexual abuse or other childhood and adult trauma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concurrent general medical disorders (especially in older patients)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concurrent psychiatric disorder (especially depressive or anxiety disorders)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family history of chronic illness</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2378041436\"><span class=\"h2\">Health care utilization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with somatic symptom disorder have physical symptoms that are accompanied by disproportionate emotional and behavioral reactions, and are thus presumed to utilize more health care than other patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/somatic-symptom-disorder-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Evidence that suggests health care use is greater in somatic symptom disorder includes studies of patients with distressing somatic symptoms and high health anxiety, which correspond to the two core features of somatic symptom disorder (see <a href=\"#H1448658677\" class=\"local\">'Signs and symptoms'</a> below). As an example:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An analysis of individual patient data from nine community studies (total n &gt;28,000 individuals) found that after controlling for potential confounding factors (eg, age, general medical illness, anxiety, and depression), a greater number of burdensome somatic symptoms was associated with greater health care use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/somatic-symptom-disorder-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective study examined health care utilization in more than 1500 primary care patients and controlled for potential confounding factors such as age, anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and general medical disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/somatic-symptom-disorder-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Hospital admissions, emergency department visits, primary care visits, specialist visits, and ambulatory procedures in the past 12 months were each greater in patients with distressing somatic symptoms than patients without distressing somatic symptoms. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a representative sample from Hong Kong (n &gt;3000 individuals), a larger number of distressing somatic symptoms and increased health anxiety were each associated with greater health care utilization, independent of the other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/somatic-symptom-disorder-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Individuals with both high somatic symptom burden and high health anxiety demonstrated the greatest use of health care, as well as functional impairment. A study of a nationally representative sample from Australia (n &gt;8000) also found that health anxiety was associated with health service utilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/somatic-symptom-disorder-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H781610873\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of somatic symptom disorder is unclear because it was introduced as a diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), which was published in 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/somatic-symptom-disorder-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Thus, hypotheses about the pathogenesis of somatic symptom disorder come from the literature on somatoform disorders. In addition, the pathogenesis of somatic symptom disorder is informed by studies of illness anxiety disorder and functional somatic syndromes (eg, fibromyalgia and irritable bowel disorder), as well as studies of &ldquo;somatization.&rdquo; Somatization is a broad construct that has been used to describe patients with medically unexplained symptoms that cause distress and impairment, but is not a formal diagnosis in DSM-5.

In addition, having a family member with a chronic illness during childhood may be a precursor to somatization as an adult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/somatic-symptom-disorder-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. Childhood experiences of parental neglect or indifference, such as inadequate food, clothing, or interest in the child&rsquo;s well-being, may be associated with somatization during adulthood and frequent visits to general medical outpatient clinics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/somatic-symptom-disorder-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/34,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,36</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Negative or unpredictable parenting during childhood may lead to insecure attachment (emotional closeness); one model proposes that somatic symptoms represent care-seeking behavior in patients with insecure attachment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/somatic-symptom-disorder-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Physical and sexual abuse</strong> &ndash; Childhood sexual abuse and recent exposure to physical or sexual violence are consistently associated with somatization in adult women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/somatic-symptom-disorder-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. As an example, a meta-analysis of 23 studies (total n &gt;4600) examined the association between a history of sexual abuse or rape and a lifetime diagnosis of functional somatic syndromes (eg, chronic noncyclic pelvic pain, fibromyalgia, or functional gastrointestinal disorders); each study included patients with a functional syndrome and controls without the syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/somatic-symptom-disorder-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The meta-analysis found that sexual abuse or rape had occurred approximately three times more often in patients with functional somatic syndromes than controls (odds ratio 3, 95% CI 2-4). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cognitive and perceptual distortions and behavioral abnormalities</strong> &ndash; Somatization may involve an over-inclusive or unrealistic concept of good health, dysfunctional assumptions about the prevalence and communicability of severe illnesses, increased attention to bodily processes to detect possible signs of illness, catastrophic interpretations of bodily sensations, problematic expectations about somatic symptoms and the course and treatment of illnesses, and difficulty with information processing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/somatic-symptom-disorder-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/35,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,38</a>]. Perception of symptoms affects how they are reported, and perception is influenced by attitudes, beliefs, and psychologic distress. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Benign somatic sensations and physical symptoms may be amplified by some patients, such as those with low pain thresholds, patients who have become sensitized to pain (ie, have a heightened response to pain because of past pain experiences), and patients who pay more attention to their bodily sensations. Normal bodily sensations may thus be perceived as abnormally intense and misattributed to serious medical disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/somatic-symptom-disorder-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The patient may then seek assurance of good health.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Despite medical reassurance, patients with somatic symptom disorder remain anxious about their health. One reason is that patients vigilantly monitor their bodies for symptoms and become sensitive to slight homeostatic fluctuations that occur normally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/somatic-symptom-disorder-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In addition, it is thought that health anxiety leads patients to confirm their fears through selective attention toward information that is consistent with having a disease and away from information that is consistent with good health.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Difficulties with self-expression</strong> &ndash; Physical symptoms may offer a means to express distress when patients do not easily express emotions in words (alexithymia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/somatic-symptom-disorder-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Patients may also present to nonpsychiatric clinicians with physical complaints when psychiatric symptoms are experienced as stigmatizing, or when clinicians appear uninterested in hearing about psychiatric problems. &#160;</p><p/><p>Another psychosocial factor that may be involved in the pathogenesis of somatic symptom disorder is family conflict [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/somatic-symptom-disorder-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Once patients develop somatic symptom disorder, it may be perpetuated by chronic stressors and maladaptive coping skills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/somatic-symptom-disorder-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In addition, behavior related to the symptoms and sick role add another psychologic dimension that maintain the disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/somatic-symptom-disorder-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The symptoms may offer benefits such as social support, escape from obligations, disability payments, and a compromise for internal conflicts.
