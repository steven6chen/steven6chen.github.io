Anemia can impair the patient's functional status, diminish physiologic reserve, and cause fatigue that can be disabling. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-related-fatigue-prevalence-screening-and-clinical-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer-related fatigue: Prevalence, screening and clinical assessment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-related-fatigue-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer-related fatigue: Treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematologic-complications-of-malignancy-anemia-and-bleeding#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematologic complications of malignancy: Anemia and bleeding&quot;, section on 'WHO grading of anemia'</a>.)</p><p>In addition to causing symptoms, the presence of anemia has been linked to an adverse prognosis in several malignancies. This has been attributed in part to a poorer response to anticancer treatment, since ionizing radiation and some forms of chemotherapy are dependent upon adequate tissue oxygen levels for cytotoxicity. These observations were used in the past to provide rationale for aggressively treating anemia in patients receiving cancer therapy. Anemia may also be a marker of more severe disease, however, independent of response to therapy.</p><p>Multiple factors can cause or contribute to anemia in patients with malignancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematologic-complications-of-malignancy-anemia-and-bleeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematologic complications of malignancy: Anemia and bleeding&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As can occur with other chronic inflammatory conditions, some cancer patients have an anemia that is a consequence of the disease and unrelated to treatment. This type of anemia is typically mild (ie, hemoglobin [HGB] level &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL),</span> and the symptoms may be difficult to distinguish from those caused by the underlying malignancy. Occasionally, anemia may be more severe, impairing functional status, diminishing physiologic reserve, and reducing quality of life.

These causes should be actively sought, and when present, treated appropriately.

However, in many cases, this is not possible and short-term red blood cell support may be needed.</p><p>Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) were first used in the 1980s to treat anemia in patients with chronic renal failure, including those on hemodialysis.

The issues surrounding the use of ESAs for patients with hematologic malignancies such as myelodysplastic syndrome are distinct and discussed separately.

However, in many cases, this is not possible or may require time to be successful. Successful treatment of the malignancy with combinations of surgery, chemotherapy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation therapy may, in the long term, improve the hemoglobin (HGB) level. However, short-term red blood cell (RBC) support may be needed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H348976573\"><span class=\"h2\">Transfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RBC transfusions are almost universally successful in raising HGB levels. Transfusions can often ameliorate the patient's symptoms rapidly and improve health-related quality of life. Exceptions include patients unable to be transfused because of the presence of multiple alloantibodies and those who refuse transfusions based on religious beliefs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-approach-to-the-patient-who-refuses-blood-transfusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The approach to the patient who refuses blood transfusion&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The use of RBC transfusions to treat anemia is discussed in more detail separately.

Both ESAs appear to be equivalent with regard to efficacy and safety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-in-the-treatment-of-anemia-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'ESAs: efficacy, side effects, and clinical use'</a> below.)</p><p>However, use of these agents in patients with cancer has become controversial because of data linking ESA use to inferior survival (particularly when used in patients whose anemia is unrelated to chemotherapy) and worse cancer outcomes. While there is general agreement that ESAs are not indicated in anemic cancer patients who are not receiving chemotherapy (with the exception of myelodysplastic syndromes or those patients with coexistent renal failure), whether ESAs should be avoided in patients who are receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy with the intent of cure remains controversial.

Patients with advanced malignancy may have a relatively short life expectancy, and prompt relief of symptoms is important. In these circumstances, transfusion may be particularly appropriate in severely symptomatic patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transfusion is now associated with a lower risk of infection (eg, human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C) because of improvements in donor screening, compared with the risk when the ESAs were originally developed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F69661\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69661 \">table 1</a>).

RBC transfusion rates were 5.8 percent with the ESA versus 11.4 percent without ESA (p&lt;0.001).

Transfusions were significantly less common in the ESA group (5 versus 20 percent of patients), and the incidence of thromboembolic events was similar, as was the one-year overall survival. While this trial provides some reassurance that the risk of thromboembolic events is not increased when ESAs are dosed according to established guidelines, it was not adequately powered to detect the magnitude of differences in survival or disease progression that have been noted with ESAs in much larger trials.</p><p/><p>In 2010, to ensure that patients receiving ESAs in the setting of cancer (regardless of the intent of therapy) were informed about potential risks before they began treatment, the FDA approved a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) risk management program termed APPRISE (Assisting Providers and Cancer Patients with Risk Information for the Safe Use of ESAs). The program required hospitals and physicians prescribing ESAs for cancer patients to register and maintain enrollment in the REMS program, complete training on the use of ESAs in patients with cancer, and provide written documentation of the discussion with patients as to the risks of stroke, heart attack, blood clots, heart failure, tumor progression, and death, prior to instituting ESAs.</p><p>In 2017, based upon an analysis of data from United States outpatient oncology practices between 2006 and 2014, the FDA determined that full implementation of the APPRISE REMS had had minimal impact on ESA utilization beyond the changes observed after the Medicare restriction of coverage of ESAs for nonrenal disease indications (see <a href=\"#H348977446\" class=\"local\">'Medicare and Medicaid'</a> below) and multiple other FDA regulatory actions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-in-the-treatment-of-anemia-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. This information led the FDA to conclude that the REMS was no longer necessary to ensure that the benefits of <span class=\"nowrap\">Epogen/Procrit</span> and Aranesp outweigh the risks, and the REMS requirements were released for these ESA products for patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy for cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/role-of-erythropoiesis-stimulating-agents-in-the-treatment-of-anemia-in-patients-with-cancer/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].

The wording of the FDA-mandated labeling neither prohibits nor prevents health care providers from prescribing an ESA to patients being treated with curative intent if, after discussion with a well-informed patient, the risks of therapy with an ESA are felt to be outweighed by the benefits of avoiding red cell transfusion.

The use of ESAs for patients with lower-risk myelodysplastic syndrome to avoid transfusions is one exception to this recommendation.

Parenteral iron augments the HGB response to ESA therapy in some subsets of patients, but not all patients require parenteral iron.

IV iron might also be preferred during ESA therapy for patients with low or low-normal serum iron levels, although it is not yet clear what parameters predict which patients are most likely to benefit from IV, rather than oral, iron.
