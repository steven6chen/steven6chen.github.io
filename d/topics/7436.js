This disease primarily affects infants. It is most commonly caused by cow's milk or soy protein, although other foods can be triggers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>A number of gastrointestinal disorders in children have been attributed to immunologic reactions to dietary proteins. Immunologic reactions to dietary proteins may be classified as IgE mediated, non-IgE mediated (T cell), or mixed (IgE and T cell mediated). The entire gastrointestinal tract can be affected, from the mouth to the rectum. Most of these disorders affect a specific region of the gastrointestinal tract, such as eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), eosinophilic gastritis, food protein-induced enteropathy, enterocolitis, or proctitis. FPIES has some features that overlap with the other non-IgE-mediated gastrointestinal allergic disorders, food protein-induced enteropathy, and proctocolitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-food-allergy-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of food allergy: An overview&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food protein-induced proctocolitis of infancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis is based upon the presence of consistent clinical features with improvement following withdrawal of the suspected causal protein. Affected children are often misdiagnosed as having acute viral gastrointestinal illness or sepsis, delaying diagnosis of FPIES for many months. An oral food challenge (OFC) is sometimes performed to confirm the diagnosis or to determine resolution of the food allergy. Treatment consists of elimination of the food trigger(s) from the diet, anticipatory guidance regarding complementary feeding, periodic reassessments for resolution, and managing acute emergencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15042624\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Non-immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated and mixed gastrointestinal immune reactions to cow's milk proteins are estimated to account for up to 40 percent of cow's milk protein hypersensitivity in infants and young children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>]. FPIES represents the severe end of the spectrum of food protein-induced gastrointestinal diseases in infants and is far less common than proctocolitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. There is a slight male predilection (52 to 60 percent) in FPIES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. Reports of FPIES in siblings of an affected child are rare. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food protein-induced proctocolitis of infancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In a large, Israeli, population-based birth cohort from a single hospital, 0.34 percent of infants (44 of 13,019) were diagnosed with FPIES (confirmed by resolution of typical FPIES symptoms with removal of cow's milk from the diet <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a clinician-supervised oral food challenge [OFC] to cow's milk in the first year of life), suggesting that FPIES may be more common than previously appreciated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The incidence of IgE-mediated milk allergy in this same cohort was 0.5 percent. Another study used data from the Australian Pediatric Surveillance Unit that provides monthly reports from 1400 involved pediatricians and is estimated to represent at least 50 percent of all eligible pediatricians in Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. They provided the pediatricians with a standardized case definition of acute FPIES and collected monthly reports of new cases of acute FPIES in children younger than two years old. A total of 230 infants with FPIES were identified, giving an estimated annual incidence of 15.4 per 100,000. While this estimate dispels the myth of FPIES as a rare disorder, it is possible that it underestimates the true incidence of FPIES due to the methodologic limitations of the voluntary reporting system. This study did not address the incidence of chronic FPIES, although it is estimated that acute FPIES accounts for the majority of the FPIES cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15042632\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FPIES is triggered by non-immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food hypersensitivity. However, the exact underlying mechanisms of FPIES are not clearly understood. It is postulated that ingestion of food allergens causes local inflammation mediated by T cells, leading to increased intestinal permeability and fluid shift [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. However, baseline intestinal absorption was normal in a group of infants with FPIES confirmed by oral food challenge (OFC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, increased tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and decreased expression of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) receptors in the intestinal mucosa may be involved in the intestinal inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Systemic food-specific IgE antibodies (determined by serum food-specific IgE <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> skin prick test) are not detected in the majority of patients with FPIES. However, up to 25 percent of children have evidence of specific IgE to the FPIES-inducing food [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]. Intestinal mucosal IgE may facilitate the antigen uptake and local intestinal inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], but this requires further study. A decrease in serum food-specific immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) antibody and an increase in serum food-specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) levels were noted in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. A subsequent study found that both casein-specific IgG4 and IgA antibodies were significantly decreased in milk-induced FPIES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Profiling of whole blood by mass cytometry demonstrated activation of cells of the innate immune system (monocytes, neutrophils, natural killer cells, and eosinophils) after food challenge in children with FPIES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This activation was not observed in children who had outgrown FPIES. Innate immune activation was confirmed by RNA sequencing in a larger cohort.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15042640\"><span class=\"h2\">Food triggers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although cow's milk and soy protein are the most common triggers, food protein-induced enterocolitis can be triggered by other proteins, such as rice or oat, particularly in infants who have had a previous reaction to cow's milk or soy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15042910\"><span class=\"h3\">Cow's milk and soy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common food triggers in FPIES are cow milk's and soy (classic FPIES), with reactions occurring to infant formula during the first months of life. While several studies have shown that over 50 percent of infants with FPIES react to both foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/18,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,25</a>], none of the 44 infants diagnosed with cow's milk FPIES in a birth cohort study in Israel showed sensitivity to soy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This difference could be attributed to a milder phenotype reported from a nonselected birth cohort compared with a more severe phenotype reported from allergy and gastroenterology referral populations. Alternatively, this could be attributed to different patterns of soy formula use in infancy.</p><p>FPIES to cow's milk in exclusively breastfed infants is rare, suggesting a protective role of breastfeeding that may be attributed to predigested and partially processed food allergens as well as presence of TGF-beta and IgA in mother's milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Only a few cases of exclusively breastfed infants with cow's milk FPIES have been reported in the literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>], and there are no reports in the literature of soy FPIES in exclusively breastfed infants.</p><p>FPIES to goat's milk was reported in an Italian series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15042648\"><span class=\"h3\">Solid foods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FPIES may be induced by solid food, including grains (rice, oats, barley, corn), meat and poultry (beef, chicken, turkey), eggs (egg white), vegetables and fruit (white potato, sweet potato, squash, string beans, mushroom, banana, apple, tomato), legumes (peanut, green peas, lentils), seafood (fish, crustaceans, molluscs), and the probiotic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=saccharomyces-boulardii-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Saccharomyces boulardii</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/8,11,12,14,17,29-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11,12,14,17,29-41</a>]<em>.</em> Among infants with solid-food FPIES in one series, 80 percent reacted to more than one food, 65 percent were previously diagnosed with cow's milk <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> soy FPIES, and 35 percent were breastfed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Infants with early-onset FPIES and reactions to fruits or vegetables are at higher risk for reacting to multiple food triggers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Rice is the most common solid food inducing FPIES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Children with rice-induced FPIES were more likely to have multiple food sensitivities and severe symptoms requiring intravenous fluid resuscitation compared with children with cow's milk or soy-induced FPIES.</p><p>Those with a history of FPIES to one grain have a 50 percent chance of developing FPIES to other grains.

Egg is a rarely reported trigger of FPIES. However, 3 of 10 young infants with milk or soy FPIES in one series developed acute symptoms to egg OFC that was done as a negative control for milk and soy at a median age of 5.5 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In addition, 4 of 38 children (11 percent) in an Australian study had FPIES to egg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15042663\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features of FPIES are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F87555\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87555 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/10,11,19,29,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,19,29,44,45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15042671\"><span class=\"h2\">Age of onset</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of classic FPIES usually begin in early infancy, within one to four weeks following introduction of cow's milk or soy protein. In extreme cases, symptoms may begin within the first days of life. The first description of the disorder included nine infants who presented with severe vomiting and diarrhea, developing an average of 11 days after birth (range 4 to 27 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. In the Israeli birth cohort previously discussed, all 44 infants with cow's milk FPIES presented with symptoms within the first six months of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Delayed introduction of cow's milk or soy in breastfed infants may result in later onset.</p><p>The mean age at onset of solid-food FPIES tends to be later than that of cow's milk and soy FPIES, typically presenting when these foods are first introduced between the ages of four to seven months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/11,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,46</a>]. The development of FPIES upon introduction of foods after one year of age is rare, although onset of a non-immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated gastrointestinal food hypersensitivity similar to FPIES, most commonly triggered by shellfish, fish, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> egg, has been observed in older children and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/19,46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,46-48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15042686\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic versus acute presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The disease typically presents in two phases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/10,11,44,45,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,44,45,49</a>]. The initial presentation of cow's milk- or soy-induced FPIES in infancy is that of a chronic disease while the food antigen is ingested on a regular basis. This can be followed by an acute phase if the antigen is removed from the diet and subsequently re-ingested, with symptoms occurring approximately two hours after ingestion and lasting several hours. An acute presentation is also seen when the antigen is ingested intermittently. Young infants with FPIES due to cow's milk <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> soy-based formulas usually have a chronic presentation, whereas solid-food FPIES can have an acute or chronic presentation, depending upon the frequency of ingestion of the offending food.</p><p>The following clinical vignette describes features of chronic and acute FPIES.</p><p>A full-term female infant who was initially exclusively breastfed was started on cow's milk-based formula supplementation at four weeks of age. The baby developed frequent episodes of vomiting, poor weight gain, and watery stools with occasional mucus over a two-week period of daily formula intake (chronic FPIES).</p><p>The baby was then returned to exclusive breastfeeding until one feeding with a cow's milk-based formula at 12 weeks of age. Approximately 90 minutes after that feeding, she developed repetitive vomiting and became lethargic (acute FPIES episode). A full sepsis work-up, toxicology, and metabolic screening were done in the emergency department. She received intravenous fluid resuscitation and antibiotics and was observed in the hospital for three days. Blood-tinged diarrhea was noted only the first hospital day. She tolerated an extensively hydrolyzed casein formula and was discharged after three days when cultures were negative.</p><p>She avoided cow's milk strictly and tolerated several solid foods introduced from five to seven months of age without symptoms, until an infant jar food-containing cheese was given. Similar to the previous episode, she developed repetitive vomiting and lethargy 90 minutes after ingestion and required intravenous fluid resuscitation (acute FPIES episode).</p><p>Nearly all patients present with vomiting, which is repetitive in the acute presentation and intermittent in the chronic setting, and are commonly pale and ill appearing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/9-11,19,29,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11,19,29,44,45</a>]. Overall, approximately 75 percent of infants with FPIES appear seriously ill, and 15 percent develop hypotension and require hospitalization, particularly with acute episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Other symptoms that can occur in both the chronic and acute presentations include diarrhea, abdominal distention, dehydration, and lethargy. In acute FPIES, repetitive emesis usually begins within 1 to 3 hours and diarrhea within 2 to 10 hours (mean onset 5 hours) of ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

Up to 25 percent of infants and children fulfilling the clinical diagnostic criteria for FPIES have or develop IgE antibodies to the trigger food. These patients are referred to as having atypical FPIES because the disorder is primarily considered a cell-mediated allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/9,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,50</a>]. They tend to have a more protracted course of FPIES and have the potential for developing symptoms of IgE-mediated allergy (eg, anaphylaxis) in addition to FPIES. In one study, for example, 7 of 17 children with milk-induced FPIES who developed milk IgE positivity progressed to immediate-allergic reactions ranging from mild symptoms to anaphylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

There are no laboratory and radiographic findings specific to FPIES. However, obtaining a complete blood count with differential during an acute presentation may be useful in that an elevated white blood cell count with a left shift is suggestive of FPIES or sepsis. In addition, an elevated methemoglobin level in a child that appears ashen, gray, or cyanotic and very ill also suggests the diagnosis of FPIES. (See <a href=\"#H10431376\" class=\"local\">'Blood tests'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15042827\" class=\"local\">'Infections'</a> below and <a href=\"#H7082543\" class=\"local\">'Congenital methemoglobinemia'</a> below.)</p><p>Endoscopy and biopsy are not routinely performed but may be indicated to rule out other pathology of the gastrointestinal tract in cases where symptoms are unusually severe and do not resolve with bowel rest or amino acid-based formula.

Nonspecific symptoms and lack of definitive diagnostic tests can contribute to the delay in diagnosis. Delayed diagnosis of solid-food FPIES may also be due to the perception that grains (eg, rice and oats) and vegetables have low allergenic potential and are not usually suspected as triggers of allergic reactions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15042753\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral food challenge</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OFC is the gold standard for diagnosis of FPIES.

Clinician-supervised OFCs are necessary, however, if the history is unclear and a specific food trigger has not been identified, if the time course symptoms are atypical (eg, severe emesis within minutes of food ingestion in the absence of food-specific IgE), or if the child has persistent symptoms on an allergen-restricted diet, with the goal in this case of identifying the relevant food(s) and avoiding unnecessary food restrictions.</p><p>The protocol for conducting OFCs for FPIES is outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F87566\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87566 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/7,17,25,45,61-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,17,25,45,61-63</a>]. An OFC for FPIES is considered a high-risk procedure. It should be conducted in a setting where intravenous access can be secured, rapid fluid resuscitation given if a reaction occurs, and prolonged observation can occur if necessary. An inpatient setting is the most appropriate for FPIES OFCs, but outpatient settings equipped with resuscitation capabilities and with access to a laboratory (for neutrophil counts and stool analysis) can be used. Performing FPIES OFCs in an intensive care unit is unnecessary, unless the patient has a history of near fatality with an episode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Symptoms typically resolve within two to four hours with standard management (eg, intravenous fluids with or without intravenous glucocorticoids). Results from a case series of five consecutive patients suggest that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ondansetron-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ondansetron</a> hydrochloride is an effective therapy that hastens symptom resolution in patients who develop profuse vomiting and systemic symptoms (eg, pallor, irritability, lethargy, confusion) during an OFC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].

There are no studies to support a particular protocol. In general, the child should be taken to the emergency department for evaluation and intravenous fluid administration if the episode is severe, manifesting with multiple episodes of projectile emesis, lethargy, and a pale or ashen appearance. Most patients with severe disease are also treated with a glucocorticoid. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ondansetron-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Ondansetron</a> is used to control emesis in children &gt;6 months old with moderate to severe symptoms.</p><p>Children who develop dehydration, tachycardia, and hypotension should receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methylprednisolone</a> as well as any necessary supportive therapy, such as oxygen or vasopressors to maintain blood pressure. The use of glucocorticoids is based upon the presumption that a cellular inflammatory response is the primary etiology of the reaction, although no studies have been conducted to confirm the efficacy of glucocorticoids in this setting. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Epinephrine</a> is used in patients with shock, but, anecdotally, it has not been helpful in resolution of other acute FPIES symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

Ondansetron is a serotonin receptor antagonist approved for prophylaxis and treatment of chemotherapy-induced nausea and emesis in patients older than six months. It is increasingly used for managing emesis due to a variety of causes in children, such as viral gastroenteritis or otitis media. Ondansetron inhibits peripheral and central activity of the vagus nerve.

However, patients with solid-food FPIES may have a more protracted course. Factors associated with a slower acquisition of tolerance include concomitant detectable food-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) and older age at both initial episode and diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/19,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,75</a>]. Age at resolution of FPIES for a particular food also varies by population. An oral food challenge (OFC) is used to determine if FPIES has resolved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15042865\"><span class=\"h2\">Cow's milk and soy FPIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Korean cohort showed 64 percent resolution by 10 months, the Israeli birth cohort showed 90 percent resolution by age three years, the mean age at resolution was 24 months in the Italian series, and a retrospective Australian series reported 88 percent resolution by three years of age for cow's milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/10,12,17,29,52,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12,17,29,52,75</a>]. In contrast, the median age of resolution of cow's milk-induced FPIES was 13.8 years in a cohort of 160 patients at the author's institution in the United States. However, the median age of resolution was 5.1 years among those with undetectable milk IgE, whereas none of the patients with detectable cow's milk IgE had resolution of cow's milk-induced FPIES while in the study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In addition, only 25 percent of soy FPIES resolved by age three years in the United States study, while, in the Korean cohort, 92 percent of children showed resolution of soy FPIES by 10 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/12,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,52</a>]. This difference may be explained by the higher proportion of subjects with detectable food-specific IgE levels and atopic dermatitis in the United States study compared with the Israeli and Korean studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15042873\"><span class=\"h2\">Solid-food FPIES natural history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the studies on solid-food FPIES at the author's institution in the US, resolution by age three years occurred in 67 percent for vegetables, 66 percent for oat, and 40 percent for rice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].

The recommended timing and frequency of oral rechallenges to determine resolution of disease are uncertain, and the decision is at the discretion of the treating clinician. Factors to consider when making this decision include the trigger food, whether there is concomitant immunoglobulin E (IgE) sensitization, and population data on resolution of the particular food, if available. We typically perform follow-up challenges every 18 to 24 months in patients without recent reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, others advise undertaking the follow-up challenge sooner: after 12 months of age for cow's milk and between six to eight months of age for soy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Further studies are needed to establish the optimal timing of follow-up challenges. (See <a href=\"#H15042857\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> above.)</p><p>The follow-up evaluation should include testing for food-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) prior to the OFC because patients initially presenting with or later developing food-specific IgE antibodies are at risk for persistent FPIES. Determination of when and how to perform a follow-up OFC in the small proportion of patients that develop positive skin prick tests <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> detectable food-specific IgE levels should also take into consideration the possibility of an acute IgE-mediated reaction. A modified OFC protocol with more incremental food-dose administration and availability of appropriate medications, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">epinephrine</a> and an antihistamine, is recommended in these cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-protein-induced-enterocolitis-syndrome-fpies/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].
