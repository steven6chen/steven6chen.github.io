Coughing helps keep people from breathing things into the airways and lungs that could cause problems (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F67527\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67527 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>It is normal for people to cough once in a while. But sometimes, a cough is a symptom of an illness or condition.</p><p>Some coughs are called &quot;dry&quot; coughs, because they don't bring up mucus (phlegm). Other coughs are called &quot;wet&quot; or &quot;productive&quot; coughs, because they do bring up mucus. Some coughs are mild and don't cause serious problems. Other coughs are severe and can cause trouble breathing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7865881\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes a cough?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In adults, common causes of a cough include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An infection of the airways or lungs (such as the common cold)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postnasal drip &ndash; Postnasal drip is when mucus from the nose drips down or flows along the back of the throat. Postnasal drip can happen when people have:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A cold</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Allergies</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A sinus infection &ndash; The sinuses are hollow areas in the bones of the face that open into the nose (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F75045\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75045 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung conditions, like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) &ndash; Both of these conditions can make it hard to breathe. COPD is usually caused by smoking.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acid reflux &ndash; Acid reflux is when the acid that is normally in your stomach backs up into your esophagus (the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A side effect from blood pressure medicines called &quot;ACE inhibitors&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoking cigarettes</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7865896\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I call my doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Call your doctor or nurse right away if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have trouble breathing or noisy breathing (wheezing).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have a fever or chest pain.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You cough up blood, or yellow or green mucus.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You cough so hard that it makes you vomit.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your cough gets worse or lasts longer than 10 days.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have a cough and have lost weight without trying.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7865911\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. To figure out the cause of your cough, your doctor or nurse will talk with you and do an exam. Based on your symptoms and other factors, he or she might decide that you need tests. These might include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A chest X-ray</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breathing tests &ndash; Breathing tests involve breathing hard into a tube. These tests show how the lungs are working.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allergy skin tests to find out what you're allergic to &ndash; For a skin test, the doctor puts a drop of the substance you might be allergic to on your skin and makes a tiny prick in the skin. Then he or she will watch your skin to see if it gets red and bumpy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A CT scan of your chest or sinuses &ndash; A CT scan is an imaging test that creates pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lab tests on a sample of the mucus you cough up</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using a &quot;scope&quot; to look inside your nose, sinuses, airway, or lungs</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests to check for acid reflux &ndash; These usually involve having a thin tube put in your mouth and down into your esophagus.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7865926\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to get rid of my cough?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To help get rid of your cough, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use a humidifier in your bedroom</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use an over-the-counter cough medicine, or suck on cough drops or hard candy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop smoking, if you smoke</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you have allergies, avoid the things you are allergic to (like pollen, dust, animals, or mold)</p><p/><p>If you have acid reflux, your doctor or nurse will tell you which lifestyle changes can help reduce symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7865941\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a cough treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on the cause of your cough. For example:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some infections are treated with antibiotic medicines. If an infection is caused by bacteria, doctors can treat it with antibiotics. If an infection is caused by the flu virus, a different medicine might help. If the infection is caused by another virus (such as the common cold), antibiotics will not help.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postnasal drip is treated with different kinds of medicines that can come as a pill or nose spray.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asthma and COPD are usually treated with medicines that people breathe into their lungs (called &quot;inhaler medicines&quot;).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acid reflux can be treated with medicine to reduce or block stomach acid.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you have a cough as a side effect from an ACE inhibitor, your doctor can switch your medicine.</p><p/><p>If the cause of your cough is not clear, your doctor might prescribe medicine to make your cough less severe. But these medicines have side effects, and doctors usually recommend them only if nothing else has worked.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7865956\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cough-runny-nose-and-the-common-cold-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cough, runny nose, and the common cold (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-bronchitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Acute bronchitis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd-including-emphysema-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including emphysema (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acid-reflux-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux disease) in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Asthma in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pneumonia in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=side-effects-from-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Side effects from medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=whooping-cough-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Whooping cough (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=seasonal-allergies-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Seasonal allergies in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sinusitis-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sinusitis in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=coughing-up-blood-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Coughing up blood (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchiectasis-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bronchiectasis in adults (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-cough-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic cough in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acid-reflux-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux disease) in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-copd-including-emphysema-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), including emphysema (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Pneumonia in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
