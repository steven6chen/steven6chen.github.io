Its major complication is the insidious development of secondary (AA) amyloidosis with eventual renal failure in uncontrolled patients. This topic will review the management of FMF. The epidemiology, genetics, pathophysiology, and clinical manifestations of FMF and an overview of periodic fever syndromes and other autoinflammatory diseases can be found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=familial-mediterranean-fever-epidemiology-genetics-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Familial Mediterranean fever: Epidemiology, genetics, and pathogenesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-familial-mediterranean-fever\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of familial Mediterranean fever&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=periodic-fever-syndromes-and-other-autoinflammatory-diseases-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Periodic fever syndromes and other autoinflammatory diseases: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H636227989\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of therapy for familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) are to prevent acute attacks and minimize subclinical inflammation in between attacks, and to prevent the development and progression of amyloidosis. Initial treatment of FMF is with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4258833468\"><span class=\"h2\">Colchicine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Colchicine</a> is primarily effective as a prophylactic treatment for the FMF attacks. It is recommended in all patients regardless of the frequency and intensity of attacks. Use of intermittent high-dose colchicine only for treatment of acute attacks of FMF does not protect against the development of amyloidosis resulting from low-grade inflammation that can occur during asymptomatic intervals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1903639870\"><span class=\"h3\">Dosing and administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> should be started as soon as a clinical diagnosis is established and should be continued indefinitely. However, in rare cases of heterozygous FMF patients who are asymptomatic for several (more than five) years and do not display elevated acute phase reactants, it may be possible to discontinue colchicine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>We recommend the following starting dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children &lt;5 years of age, &le;0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (&le;0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> in case tablets contain 0.6 mg).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children 5 to 10 years of age, 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (1.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> in case tablets contain 0.6 mg).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children &gt;10 years of age and adults, 1 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (1.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> in case tablets contain 0.6 mg).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with preexisting complications (eg, renal amyloidosis) or greater disease activity (ie, high frequency of attacks, long duration of each attack, involvement of multiple sites during the attack, and joint involvement) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], higher initial doses (up to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> are needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].</p><p/><p>Adherence with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> is higher with once-daily dosing, and its efficacy is the same as with splitting the dose into two divided daily doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. We do not split the colchicine dose unless the patient does not tolerate once-daily dosing due to side effects, which are most commonly gastrointestinal. We generally start with a lower dose and increase the dose by 0.5 to 0.6 mg according to the patient&rsquo;s response and tolerance without exceeding the maximum recommended daily dose of colchicine, which is 2 mg for children under 12 years and 3 mg for adults. Dose adjustment of colchicine is necessary in patients with renal impairment. Dose adjustments are found in the Lexicomp drug information topic within UpToDate.</p><p>Administering <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> only during an acute FMF attack or increasing its dose during the acute attack usually has no impact on the attack symptoms. In addition, high-dose colchicine is associated with significant side effects. We do not administer colchicine intravenously because of the risk of serious adverse effects.

Laboratory testing for colchicine toxicity includes a complete blood count (CBC) to assess for leukopenia. For monitoring disease response, we check erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and, when available, serum amyloid A (SAA). We also check the urine for proteinuria, which may be the first sign of renal amyloidosis. We check liver and kidney function tests annually to ensure that no modification of the colchicine dose is required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2810963765\"><span class=\"h3\">Mechanism of action</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathophysiology of FMF involves the recruitment and activation of neutrophils at serosal surfaces. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Colchicine</a> affects the motility of neutrophils, which is crucial for their extravasation in response to inflammatory stimuli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. The ability of colchicine to cause mitotic arrest is unlikely to play a role in its therapeutic action, because the dose required to suppress mitosis is in considerable excess of that used for FMF.

In one such trial that included 43 patients with FMF, treatment with colchicine resulted in a significant reduction of the number of attacks as compared with placebo (29 versus 178). Patients treated with colchicine also had a higher proportion of mild attacks as compared with placebo (70 versus 25 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>In the long term, up to 40 percent of the patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> had partial remission, approximately 5 to 10 percent were non-responders, and 2 to 5 percent did not tolerate the drug, mainly due to gastrointestinal side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

However, a higher <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> dose of 1.5 to 2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> appears to be required, and therapy should be instituted before the plasma creatinine concentration reaches 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (132 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].

In one study that included 1070 patients with FMF, among 960 patients who initially had no evidence of amyloidosis, the rate of development of proteinuria was 1.7 percent after 11 years in the adherent patients. By contrast, proteinuria developed in 49 percent of nonadherent patients after nine years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Among 86 patients who already had non-nephrotic proteinuria prior to therapy, colchicine led to resolution of proteinuria in five and stabilization in 68; 13 had progressive disease.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Colchicine</a> is not likely to be effective in patients who already have chronic renal failure, since irreversible glomerular injury is probably present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. However, it can prevent recurrent disease (as manifested by proteinuria) in the transplant kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The optimal colchicine dose in this setting is 1.5 to 2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day;</span> lower doses are less predictably effective. A report of three patients with amyloidosis in native kidneys described improvement in proteinuria and the plasma creatinine level, and reduction in the frequency of peritonitis attacks with the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> to colchicine, although the mechanism of the azathioprine effect is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Anecdotal reports suggest that, in patients with established secondary (AA) amyloidosis, anti-interleukin (IL)-1 treatment can also reverse proteinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Side effects, most commonly gastrointestinal (eg, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting), are uncommon at low doses (0.5 to 1.2 mg per day), even when given continuously over years. Less common (&lt;1 percent) side effects include bone marrow suppression, hepatotoxicity, and myotoxicity. Chronic renal insufficiency leading to increased colchicine levels is a major risk factor for side effects. In addition, colchicine has drug interactions and altered metabolism in certain patient populations. In particular, concomitant administration of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 34A has been associated with a greater risk of colchicine toxicity due to the resulting increased serum concentration of colchicine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76992\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76992 \">table 1</a>).

In one study, more than 40 percent of the patients with apparent colchicine-resistant FMF (crFMF) actually had poor adherence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

In clinical practice, we do not use a specific threshold for defining crCRF, and it is largely based on poor patient tolerance of attacks rather than their frequency. Consensus recommendations for the management of FMF have defined crFMF as the occurrence of one or more attacks each month despite receiving the maximally tolerated dose for at least six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Patients with elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), or serum amyloid A (SAA) between attacks despite maximal or tolerable dose of colchicine are also considered crFMF because their risk of developing amyloidosis.</p><p/><p>The characteristics of patients with FMF who are truly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> non-responders are incompletely understood.

Non-responders tended to be from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, have less education, and have a more severe form of disease. In addition, they had a statistically lower concentration of colchicine in mononuclear cells. The authors speculated that non-responders may be genetically predisposed to have a lower colchicine concentrating ability. One factor might be poorer gastrointestinal absorption of the drug, which has a wide range of absorption (24 to 88 percent) after oral ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In addition, colchicine activity may be related to its concentration within leukocytes rather than plasma levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3606819316\"><span class=\"h2\">Colchicine resistance or intolerance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 5 to 10 percent of FMF patients are non-responders, and 2 to 5 percent do not tolerate the drug mainly due to gastrointestinal side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Interleukin (IL)-1 inhibition is the preferred second-line therapy for these patients. Anecdotal reports suggest that IL-1 inhibition has a beneficial effect on amyloidosis, but more data are needed to confirm this observation. Thus, for patients who are colchicine-resistant and on IL-1 inhibitors, we give concomitant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> at a tolerable dose (or approximately 1.5 to 2 mg daily) in order to prevent amyloidosis.

The same study found that all the infants born to mothers with FMF on colchicine were healthy. Furthermore, colchicine therapy has never been associated with an increased risk of fetal abnormalities. Four large studies involving a total of more than 1000 colchicine-exposed pregnancies have shown no evidence of an increase in cytogenetic or congenital abnormalities and suggest that colchicine treatment does not confer a risk of preterm delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/47-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3744576345\"><span class=\"h2\">Breastfeeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nursing is safe in women with FMF who continue to take <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-familial-mediterranean-fever/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

We recommend initial treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> in all patients with FMF (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). The maximum recommended daily dose of colchicine is 2 mg for children under 12 years and 3 mg for adults. (See <a href=\"#H4258833468\" class=\"local\">'Colchicine'</a> above and <a href=\"#H825246952\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After initiation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a>, patients with FMF should be followed closely for three to six months to observe its therapeutic effect on attack frequency and severity. Laboratory testing for colchicine toxicity includes a complete blood count (CBC) to assess for leukopenia. For monitoring disease response, we check erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), and, when available, serum amyloid A (SAA). We also check the urine for proteinuria, which may be the first sign of renal amyloidosis. We check liver and kidney function tests annually to ensure that no modification of the colchicine dose is required. (See <a href=\"#H1183556811\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At doses of 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> is safe even when given continually over decades. Side effects, most commonly gastrointestinal (eg, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting), are uncommon at low doses (0.5 to 1.2 mg per day). Less common (&lt;1 percent) side effects include bone marrow suppression, hepatotoxicity, and myotoxicity. Chronic renal insufficiency or liver cirrhosis leading to increased colchicine levels is a major risk factor for side effects. Colchicine also has drug interactions and altered metabolism in certain patient populations. (See <a href=\"#H3028512520\" class=\"local\">'Safety'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with continued symptoms despite treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> should be carefully reassessed, paying specific attention to the type of persistent symptoms, the degree to which symptoms have improved or worsened, and adherence with medications. Patient who fail to respond to therapy with colchicine may have an alternative diagnosis (eg, another hereditary autoinflammatory disease), may be nonadherent or incompletely adherent, or may be colchicine-resistant. (See <a href=\"#H3760771913\" class=\"local\">'Reassessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 5 to 10 percent of FMF patients are colchicine-resistant, and 2 to 5 percent do not tolerate the drug mainly due to gastrointestinal side effects. Interleukin (IL)-1 inhibition is the preferred second-line therapy for these patients. It is unknown whether IL-1 inhibitors have a beneficial effect on amyloidosis. Thus, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> should be continued in FMF patients who receive such treatment. (See <a href=\"#H3606819316\" class=\"local\">'Colchicine resistance or intolerance'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3231174827\" class=\"local\">'Interleukin-1 inhibition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients with FMF may develop other related features that are not responsive to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> or IL-1 inhibitors and require additional therapy.
