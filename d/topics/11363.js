White blood cells fight infections in the body. They are made in the center of your bones, in a part called the bone marrow. When people have multiple myeloma, the bone marrow makes too many of these white blood cells and not enough of the normal blood cells a person's body needs. This can cause symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H559313621\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of multiple myeloma?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple myeloma can cause many different symptoms. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone pain or bones that break easily</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea, vomiting, confusion, or feeling more thirsty than usual</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling more weak, tired, or short of breath than usual</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blurry vision</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Numbness, tingling, or weakness in the chest, lower back, or legs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Getting sick more easily</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Losing weight without trying to</p><p/><p>All of these symptoms can also be caused by conditions that are not multiple myeloma. But if you have these symptoms, let your doctor or nurse know.</p><p>Sometimes, symptoms of multiple myeloma can be a medical emergency. For example, it is an emergency if multiple myeloma cells or pieces of broken bone push down on a person's spinal cord. The spinal cord is the group of nerves that runs down a person's back. See a doctor immediately if you have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe back pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weakness, numbness, or tingling in the legs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No control over your bladder or bowel (that is a new problem)</p><p/><p>People with multiple myeloma can get sick from infections more easily than normal. Because of this, it's important to wash your hands often and stay away from people who are sick. Tell your doctor or nurse right away if you get a fever.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H559313628\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for multiple myeloma?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will do an exam and tests. Tests can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood or urine tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone marrow biopsy &ndash; A doctor will take a very small sample of the bone marrow. Another doctor will look at the sample under a microscope to see if cancer cells are present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging tests, such as CT scans, PET scans, MRI scans, or X-rays &ndash; Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H559313635\"><span class=\"h1\">How is multiple myeloma treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with multiple myeloma often have 1 or more of the following treatments:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>&quot;Watch and wait&quot;</strong> &ndash; Some people have a condition called &quot;smoldering myeloma&quot; before they get multiple myeloma. These people do not have any symptoms and might not receive treatment right away. But they do get checked by a doctor regularly. When they start to have symptoms, they will have active treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chemotherapy</strong> &ndash; Chemotherapy is the term doctors use to describe a group of medicines that kill cancer cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Steroid medicines</strong> &ndash; These medicines can kill cancer cells and slow cancer growth. These are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medicines called &quot;immune modulating medicines&quot;</strong> &ndash; These medicines stop the cancer from growing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bone marrow transplant</strong> &ndash; The bone marrow makes blood cells, including white blood cells. During a bone marrow transplant, a doctor removes some bone marrow from the body. Then, the person gets medicines called &quot;chemotherapy.&quot; These medicines are usually used to kill cancer cells, but they also kill bone marrow cells. After chemotherapy, the doctor puts the bone marrow back into the person's body.</p><p/><p>People with multiple myeloma also get treatment for any symptoms they have. For example, doctors might treat bone symptoms with pain medicines, medicines to stop bone loss, or radiation therapy. Radiation can kill cancer cells.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H559313642\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment, you will be checked every so often to see if the cancer comes back. Treatment does not usually cure the disease, but it can reduce symptoms and help people live longer. Follow-up tests can include blood tests, urine tests, imaging tests, or bone marrow biopsy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H559313649\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens if the multiple myeloma comes back?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the multiple myeloma comes back, you might get more chemotherapy, immune modulating medicines, steroid medicines, or bone marrow transplant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H559313656\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to follow all your doctors' instructions about visits and tests. It's also important to talk to your doctor about any side effects or problems you have during treatment.</p><p>Getting treated for multiple myeloma involves making many choices, such as what treatment to have and when. Always let your doctors and nurses know how you feel about a treatment. Any time you are offered a treatment, ask:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the benefits of this treatment? Is it likely to help me live longer? Will it reduce or prevent symptoms?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the downsides to this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there other options besides this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happens if I do not have this treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H559313663\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-back-pain-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Low back pain in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-incontinence-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Urinary incontinence (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nausea-and-vomiting-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nausea and vomiting in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-are-clinical-trials-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What are clinical trials?
