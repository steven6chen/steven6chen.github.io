In a prospective longitudinal cohort study of 265 adult patients with advanced cancer, the extent to which oncologists engaged patients in discussions regarding prognosis and treatment options was assessed using the Prognostic and Treatment Choices (PTCC) scale, and patients' ratings of the patient-doctor relationship were assessed using two validated instruments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-palliative-care/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A one-unit increase in the PTCC score of the recorded visit was associated with a significant, although small, improvement in patient ratings of the therapeutic alliance within seven days and at three months after the visit.

While there are no consistent findings from randomized interventional studies that show better patient outcomes after modifying communication skills to deliver serious news, a number of studies have shown that clinician communication skills can be improved by training. A 2017 guideline from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recommends communication skills training for oncologists and presents best practices for core communication skills when clinicians are communicating with patients and their loved ones about goals of care, prognosis, treatment options, and end of life care (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F114920\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114920 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-palliative-care/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Benefit was supported by a prospective trial in which 40 women with breast cancer receiving weekly paclitaxel wore frozen gloves and socks on their dominant side before, during, and after each infusion (90 minutes total); symptoms on the treated side were compared with the untreated (nondominant) side [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-palliative-care/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Improvements were reported in both objective and subjective measures of neuropathy, and treatment was well tolerated. While frozen socks and gloves may be useful to diminish objective and subjective signs and symptoms of neuropathy in patients receiving weekly paclitaxel, the data remain limited by the small numbers of patients evaluated, and we await confirmation in additional larger studies before recommending this approach.

Recently, a randomized trial found that patients with MPE treated with indwelling catheters, compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=talc-sterile-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">talc pleurodesis</a>, had fewer hospital days, although breathlessness, quality of life, and survival were not altered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-palliative-care/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Adverse events (mostly procedural-related pain) were more common in the indwelling catheter group, but serious adverse events were more frequent in the pleurodesis group. While this trial supports indwelling catheters as an appropriate initial method for treating recurrent MPE, the increase in adverse events and lack of superiority for most outcomes may inform patient choice for management of their effusion.

In a randomized trial in patients receiving HEC, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thalidomide</a> (100 mg twice daily on days 1 to 5) was compared with placebo; all patients received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palonosetron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">palonosetron</a> on day 1 and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> on days 2 through 4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-palliative-care/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Patients receiving thalidomide had better control of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting but higher rates of sedation, dizziness, constipation, and dry mouth. An NK1R antagonist is preferred for patients receiving HEC, but the combination of thalidomide plus palonosetron and dexamethasone is an option for prevention of delayed emesis in patients who lack access to NK1R antagonists.

In a randomized trial comparing two doses of vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) with a nonhormonal vaginal moisturizer in postmenopausal cancer survivors (primarily breast cancer), all three groups reported similar improvement in dyspareunia and vaginal dryness symptoms at 12 weeks, but only the higher dose DHEA group reported significant improvement in sexual function over baseline on a validated sexual health measure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-palliative-care/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Vaginal DHEA holds promise as a GSM treatment for breast cancer survivors, but safety concerns remain because it increases serum estrogen levels.

In a randomized trial of 77 patients with mild Alzheimer disease (AD), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylphenidate</a> improved apathy scores compared with placebo over a 12-week treatment period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-palliative-care/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Adverse effects were similar between groups.

Hemodialysis is frequently difficult to perform because of hemodynamic instability, and outcomes are dismal in patients who are not listed for liver transplant. In a retrospective cohort study, mortality at six months was 84 percent (median survival, 21 days) among patients not listed for transplant who developed hepatorenal syndrome and initiated dialysis; recovery of kidney function sufficient to stop dialysis occurred in 4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-palliative-care/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In patients with cirrhosis and hepatorenal syndrome, the most appropriate use of dialysis is as a bridge to liver transplantation.

An analysis of data from 462 consecutive patients with APC treated at a single institution identified nine factors (age, smoking status, liver metastases, performance status, pain, jaundice, ascites, duration of first-line chemotherapy, and second-line treatment regimen) that independently influenced survival and were used to develop a prognostic model which discriminated three groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-palliative-care/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Benefit from second-line chemotherapy was higher in the better prognostic groups.

Though its legality in the United States has not been specifically tested, patient, family, and clinician participation in VSED is probably not illegal. Initial assessment should ensure that the patient has decision-making capacity, the decision to pursue VSED is not influenced by mental illness, the patient is fully informed of the risks and alternatives, and the choice is voluntary. Patients choosing VSED will need palliative care to manage the associated thirst and to provide substantial caregiver emotional support. Several health care associations have issued guidance on how to care for patients who choose VSED.

In a population-based study from Ontario that examined location of death and intensity of care received in the last six months of life, immigrants (residents &lt;30 years) were more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), die in the ICU, and receive more aggressive care (including mechanical ventilation, dialysis, and feeding tube placement) than long-standing residents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-palliative-care/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Rates of ICU death varied among different nationalities but were highest in Southern Asians and lowest in Western and Northern Europeans. Further studies are required to understand the factors underlying this association, but they may include health literacy, cultural preferences, and communication barriers.

In a randomized trial, 90 patients with advanced cancer who were admitted to an acute palliative care unit and had persistent agitated delirium despite scheduled haloperidol were assigned to receive a single intravenous dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a> or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-palliative-care/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The lorazepam group had lower RASS (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale) scores at eight hours, required less rescue neuroleptics, were perceived to be more comfortable by blinded caregivers and nurses, and had similar survival to the placebo group (68 versus 73 hours). For palliative care patients with persistent agitated delirium despite the use of haloperidol, we suggest a single dose of intravenous lorazepam rather than haloperidol alone.
