The most common reason for amniocentesis is to determine for sure whether a fetus has Down syndrome. This test is usually done between 15 and 18 weeks of pregnancy, but it can be done at any time in gestation. Amniocentesis can also provide information about:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic disorders other than Down syndrome, such as in the presence of fetal anomalies documented at ultrasound scan </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection in the fetus</p><p/><p>Although common in the past, amniocentesis is now rarely performed to get information about: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neural tube defects (such as spina bifida or anencephaly)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood type of the fetus (which can be important if the mother's blood contains antibodies that can react with the fetus's red blood cells)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Readiness of the fetus's lungs to live outside the uterus (if done late in pregnancy)</p><p/><p>More detailed information about amniocentesis is available by subscription. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-amniocentesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic amniocentesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">AMNIOCENTESIS PROCEDURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step in the procedure is to perform an ultrasound of the uterus. With ultrasound, the doctor can see the fetus, amniotic fluid, placenta, and uterus.</p><p>After cleaning the abdomen, the doctor inserts a needle and uses ultrasound imaging to guide the needle safely into a pocket of amniotic fluid. The doctor removes a small amount of fluid (usually less than one ounce [30 mL]). The needle stick is mildly uncomfortable or crampy.</p><p>Occasionally, the doctor may need to insert the needle more than once to get enough fluid. If there is more than one fetus, the doctor may need to take a sample of fluid from around each fetus.</p><p>The sample of amniotic fluid is then sent to a laboratory for testing. In a small number of cases, the fluid does not contain enough cells. If this happens, you may be asked to have another amniocentesis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">AMNIOCENTESIS COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Amniocentesis involves certain risks. Complications can include:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Leakage of amniotic fluid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Leakage of amniotic fluid from the vagina sometimes happens after amniocentesis. In most cases, there is only a small amount of fluid leakage that stops on its own within one week.</p><p>In rare cases, leakage can be ongoing. If this occurs, the mother and fetus are monitored closely for signs of problems, such as infection. In these rare cases, there is an increased risk of pregnancy complications, including preterm delivery. The risk of these complications usually depends on how much fluid is left around the fetus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Injury to the fetus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There might be a very small increased risk of problems developing in the fetus because of amniocentesis. This might include clubfoot, hip dislocation, and lung problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amniocentesis-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Talk to your doctor about these risks before having amniocentesis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the mother has a chronic infection, like HIV or hepatitis, there is a chance that the fetus could become infected because of the amniocentesis. The risk is very small, but you should talk to your doctor about the risks if you have one of these infections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Miscarriage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies have shown that women who have amniocentesis have a small increased risk of miscarriage. Fortunately, this complication is rare. The risk of miscarriage related to amniocentesis is estimated to be 1 in 300 to 500 (0.2 to 0.3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amniocentesis-beyond-the-basics/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">AFTER THE AMNIOCENTESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immediately after the procedure, some women have mild cramping, a small amount of vaginal bleeding, and a small amount of amniotic fluid leaking from the vagina. This should all resolve quickly.</p><p>However, women should call their doctor after amniocentesis if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They continue to leak fluid or bleed</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They have severe cramping lasting several hours</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They have a fever (temperature higher than 100.4&ordm;F or 38&ordm;C) after the amniocentesis</p><p/><p>Some doctors recommend that women avoid having sex and exercising on the day of the amniocentesis. Women can resume their normal activities the day after the amniocentesis.</p><p>Women who have Rh negative blood type (eg, A, B, AB, or O negative) are usually given an intramuscular shot called Rh(D) immune globulin (RhoGam) after amniocentesis. This shot helps protect future pregnancies against problems that can develop if the mother is Rh negative and is pregnant with a fetus who is Rh positive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">AMNIOCENTESIS RESULTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most labs are able to provide Down syndrome results within 7 to 14 days. Other tests may take less or more time to get results, depending on the test. Ask your doctor or nurse when you can expect to have the results.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER TESTING OPTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Amniocentesis is one option to get information about the fetus. It is not a required test. You should discuss the risks and benefits of this test with your doctor.</p><p>For genetic information, the chorionic villus sampling (CVS) is an alternative to amniocentesis. An advantage of CVS is that it can be done earlier in the pregnancy than amniocentesis (at 10 to 12 weeks of pregnancy). However, CVS has risks that are similar to amniocentesis (leakage of fluid, infection, miscarriage). More information about CVS is available separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chorionic-villus-sampling-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Chorionic villus sampling (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are other tests that can provide some information about the fetus' risk of having Down syndrome. However, these tests do not tell you for sure if your fetus is affected. They only provide you with information about the probability of the fetus having Down syndrome. Some women prefer to have this type of tests, called a screening test, before making up their mind about having an invasive test like amniocentesis or CVS.</p><p>More information about screening tests is available separately.
