Patients face challenges to their sense of wholeness. The ways in which people respond to these threats to personal integrity range from highly effective strategies for coping to dysfunctional reactions, often in the same person at different times. Patients undergo adjustment in response to these challenges, during which they may deny, withdraw, or become sad and angry at care providers, family members, friends, themselves, or God. Understanding these issues and the ways in which they interact with physical distress is essential to assessment and management in end of life care. </p><p>This topic presents an overview of psychosocial issues for patients with an advanced illness who enter palliative care. In addition, this topic provides a series of questions to use with patients and caregivers that can guide the clinician in discussing sensitive issues. Specific issues related to psychosocial issues in palliative care are discussed in more detail separately.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=communication-of-prognosis-in-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Communication of prognosis in palliative care&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=discussing-serious-news\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Discussing serious news&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of spirituality in palliative care&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-anxiety-in-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of anxiety in palliative care&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment and management of depression in palliative care&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-symptom-assessment-in-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to symptom assessment in palliative care&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-managing-common-non-pain-symptoms-in-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of managing common non-pain symptoms in palliative care&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexuality-in-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sexuality in palliative care&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pain-assessment-and-management-in-the-last-weeks-of-life\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pain assessment and management in the last weeks of life&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palliative-care-the-last-hours-and-days-of-life\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palliative care: The last hours and days of life&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparing-children-for-the-loss-of-a-loved-one\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preparing children for the loss of a loved one&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H284829448\"><span class=\"h1\">THE CLINICIAN&rsquo;S ROLE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician plays an important role in the care of patients in palliative care. In addition to addressing their medical needs, they assist patients by helping them to identify sources of meaning and purpose as they approach the end of life. Clinicians also provide support for their feelings, even difficult ones, including sadness about saying goodbye or worries about failing loved ones by feeling ready to die. Of note, the clinician does not need to do this alone and may call upon chaplains, mental health providers, and palliative care colleagues as needed.</p><p>The clinician can achieve these goals by: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identifying the patient&rsquo;s strengths and vulnerabilities </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exploring spiritual practices and beliefs (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of spirituality in palliative care&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inquiring about other areas of possible distress (eg, finances, family adjustment, self-esteem) </p><p/><p>The role of physicians in relation to common issues experienced by patients in palliative care is discussed below. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H284831601\"><span class=\"h2\">Prerequisites for addressing psychosocial issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of psychosocial issues requires that symptoms be adequately controlled and that the patient relationship with his or her clinicians be secure and supportive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H284831627\"><span class=\"h3\">Symptom management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Effective symptom management enhances quality of life and allows patients and their families to maintain hope, reaffirm important connections, and attain a sense of completion.

Patients with different advanced diseases (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS], heart failure, advanced cancer, or renal disease) share symptoms such as pain, fatigue, and breathlessness that are often burdensome and decrease quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. </p><p>Psychological, social, and spiritual factors may exacerbate physical symptoms.

When physical, psychological, and spiritual sources of distress are inseparably intermixed, causing &ldquo;total pain syndrome,&rdquo; a fully integrated clinical approach is required that addresses the multiple dimensions of suffering [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

Pain has a distorting effect on personality, behavior, mood, decision-making, and coping. Untreated pain can exacerbate hopelessness and ruminative anxious thoughts, which may lead some patients to consider hastening death or even suicide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness/abstract/15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-19</a>]. While anxiety and depression may make pain less tolerable and disrupt functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>], pain can also exacerbate anxiety, which may resolve when pain is controlled. </p><p>Unfortunately, pain may be underreported <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> undertreated in the terminally ill patient. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several factors may lead to patients underreporting pain: worry about distracting their clinicians from treating the underlying medical condition, belief that they deserve to suffer due to feelings of depression and guilt or in response to existential or spiritual distress, concerns about addiction, misunderstanding how to use analgesics, intolerable analgesic side effects, and the belief that an escalating need for medication may indicate imminent death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Even when pain is reported, clinicians may undertreat it due to disbelief in the patient&rsquo;s reported level of somatic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]; overt or subtle bias based on race, gender, socioeconomic status, or appearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]; or concern about pain management in patients with a history of substance use disorders.

However, like other relationships, it may be subject to strain during the course of a terminal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. If the patient does not trust the clinician, or if the quality of communication between them is poor or has become strained, it will be difficult for the clinician to gauge the patient&rsquo;s adjustment as the disease progresses and to provide needed support and a sense of security.</p><p>The clinician can pose the following questions to assess the state of the treatment relationship with his or her patient. The answers can provide clarity to the working relationship and help uncover the patient&rsquo;s expectations. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is your sense of how well we are working together?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there things I could be doing to be helpful that I'm not doing now?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H284832149\"><span class=\"h2\">Importance of self-awareness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In response to demands on their time and the energy needed to respond to crisis situations, clinicians often cope by suppressing or repressing their emotions towards their patients. However, it is important that clinicians assess these feelings, which may influence the therapeutic relationship. A lack of awareness of one&rsquo;s own negative emotions or harboring strongly positive feelings about a patient can prompt a variety of maladaptive responses on the part of the clinician, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distancing oneself </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Becoming overinvolved </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conveying a lack of compassion </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Failing to set appropriate limits on patient behavior</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Terminating or transferring the patient&rsquo;s care abruptly or without providing due process </p><p/><p>In addition, experiencing strong emotions in reaction to patients <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> their loved ones can be a sign that unacknowledged or unexpressed issues are present on the part of the patient (or their loved ones), such as an undiagnosed psychiatric illness (eg, depression or personality disorder) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness/abstract/2,10,29-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,10,29-34</a>]. </p><p>Taking a few minutes to reflect on one&rsquo;s caseload at the end of the day and periodically reviewing challenging cases with a colleague may help clinicians to become more conscious of their emotional responses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H284835652\"><span class=\"h2\">Checking in</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When discussing sensitive issues with patients, it may be important to check in with the patient from time to time to re-evaluate these concerns with questions like:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Am I answering your question? </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How is this going? </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the patient on pain medication (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a>): Have you had any worries about the fact that you&rsquo;re now needing to take the morphine regularly? This question allows the clinician to assess fears about addiction to pain medication. </p><p/><p>Checking in allows the clinician to clarify a patient&rsquo;s worries, to track how his or her concerns are evolving, and to provide the appropriate amount of information when needed by the patient, thereby avoiding overwhelming the patient with too much information.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13274808\"><span class=\"h1\">COMMON ISSUES FOR PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED ILLNESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following are some common concerns voiced by patients with advanced illness:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The meaning of the illness (see <a href=\"#H13274834\" class=\"local\">'The meaning of the illness'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of dignity (see <a href=\"#H13274840\" class=\"local\">'Loss of dignity'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fear of increasing dependency on others (see <a href=\"#H13274846\" class=\"local\">'Dependency'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fear (see <a href=\"#H13274852\" class=\"local\">'Fear'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Worries about how much time they have left to live (see <a href=\"#H416337\" class=\"local\">'Time'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Worries about loved ones (see <a href=\"#H13274858\" class=\"local\">'Concerns about caregivers'</a> below)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grief and loss (see <a href=\"#H13274864\" class=\"local\">'Grief and loss'</a> below)</p><p/><p>Keeping these concerns in mind can help the clinician to anticipate, diagnose, acknowledge, and respond effectively to patient and family distress.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13274834\"><span class=\"h2\">The meaning of the illness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When bad things happen, people search for a reason to explain them. For example, a patient may blame him or herself for having &ldquo;caused&rdquo; his or her cancer or may attribute his or her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or terminal heart failure to the fact he or she was (or is) a smoker. In contrast, other patients may perceive their illness as evidence of abandonment by God, particularly if they fear that the rest of their life will be filled with suffering until death. </p><p>The clinician can gain insight to the unique impact of the illness on the patient and his or her loved ones by asking the patient open-ended questions that elicit the narrative about what he or she believes has happened [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. Examples of appropriate questions include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is your understanding of what this disease means? </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How do you think about what&rsquo;s happened to you?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are your thoughts about what may have caused this disease?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What&rsquo;s been the hardest part for you? For your family?</p><p/><p>In this way, clinicians can delineate the meaning of illness and what the patient feels caused it, identify factual inaccuracies about the medical situation, and correct any misunderstandings about the intent of any treatments being rendered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness/abstract/15,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,38</a>]. These conversations may help clarify the patient and family&rsquo;s values and experience of illness. In addition, they may also indicate spiritual or existential distress, disruptions in personal relationships, or the presence of depression, which may require the involvement of other members of the palliative care team (eg, spiritual leaders, psychologists, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> social workers).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13274840\"><span class=\"h2\">Loss of dignity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serious illness may lead to the gradual erosion of a patient&rsquo;s sense of self-worth and the meaning of life, resulting in the loss of dignity. Dignity-related concerns in the setting of terminal illness include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shifts in identity and role functioning </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concerns about &ldquo;unfinished business&rdquo; </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concerns about legacy </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Questions about the ongoing purpose of life </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling spiritually disconnected</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling unsupported or misunderstood by family or health care providers </p><p/><p>Uncontrolled physical symptoms, depression, anxiety, and cognitive clouding also result in a loss of dignity and control, and in a sense of diminishment. Clinicians directly involved with the patient can support the patient&rsquo;s &ldquo;wholeness&rdquo; simply by showing they are interested in the patient&rsquo;s life and concerns beyond the illness. A 2016 consensus-building study of nursing home residents receiving palliative care summarizes dignity-conserving care measures, which include not making residents feel like a burden to others, staff not talking about residents in front of other residents, allowing residents to make choices in daily life, respecting residents&rsquo; personal space and need for privacy, and providing freedom to complain without fear of repercussions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13274846\"><span class=\"h2\">Dependency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients lose physical and psychological control as illness progresses, triggering shame and fear, which may amplify isolation. Increasing need for help with daily functions may be humiliating and even lead patients to think of hastening death. </p><p>As physical dependency increases, feelings of vulnerability and helplessness add to concerns about becoming a burden to family members in emotional, physical, and financial ways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In addition, he or she may face a diminishing sphere of control, particularly as the patient relinquishes roles and responsibilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Feelings of anger, guilt, boredom, loneliness, and alienation are common for patients losing their independence. Shame may arise from the intensity of these emotions, and patients may become distressed by not feeling like themselves. One consequence may be a transient increase in family turmoil and conflict due to shifting responsibilities. </p><p>If a patient expresses concerns about becoming increasingly dependent on others, the clinician should encourage the patient to talk about these difficult feelings. This will often allow the clinician to provide reassurance that such thoughts represent common responses to serious illness. To foster this dialogue, the clinician might ask the following questions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is it like for you to have to depend more on others? </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do you have concerns about burdening others? How do these affect you? </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What kinds of things that are important to you are you still able to do? </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What have you had to give up?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are your concerns about controlling symptoms? </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do you feel you have been able to express your wishes about your treatment with your clinical team and your family? </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What kinds of situations do you worry about that might be overwhelming for people who you love and rely on? Or overwhelming to you? </p><p/><p>Listening to the patient discuss these issues is often sufficient to provide comfort, but it is important that the clinician not respond offhandedly. For example, patients should not be told &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about anything&rdquo; as a response to concerns about helplessness. Such reactions may actually increase the patient&rsquo;s sense of dependency and isolation.</p><p>If feelings such as anger threaten the patient&rsquo;s relationships or lead to dangerous behavior, the clinician should directly address the situation and assess the patient for depression, delirium, and other organic mental states. The clinician should also directly query the patient about feelings of increasing isolation and abandonment, and even thoughts of suicide.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13274852\"><span class=\"h2\">Fear</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Worsening illness and impending death can evoke fears of helplessness, abandonment, and loss of control. In addition, fear may be accompanied by overwhelming guilt and anxiety as the patient anticipates separation from loved ones. Questions about the exact nature of a patient&rsquo;s fear can help reduce anxiety and avoid misunderstandings. Three example questions are discussed below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What frightens you most about what is happening to you now? &ndash; This question helps orient the clinician to the patient&rsquo;s present concerns. Commonly, patients will talk about pain, worries about burdening loved ones, or concerns about death and dying. Symptoms should be addressed immediately. Spiritual distress should be acknowledged if present, and referral to a religious or spiritual leader should be offered. Evaluating the patient and family&rsquo;s emotional state is important and may lead to referral to mental health providers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are your fears and worries about what may happen next? &ndash; This question may allow the clinician to deepen the conversation with the patient by focusing more directly on the patient&rsquo;s future concerns. These often include physical suffering, loss of functioning, existential or spiritual suffering, burdening family, grief, prognosis, or how death might occur. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do you have particular worries about death or what dying might be like? &ndash; This may be appropriate if the patient brings up the topic of prognosis, death, or dying. It is important to include how physical and emotional symptoms will be managed at the end of life as part of the clinician&rsquo;s response. In addition, the clinician should avoid providing blanket reassurance, as this may actually exacerbate anxiety.</p><p/><p>It is also important that clinicians remember to close difficult conversations with an offer to clarify information provided <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> to discuss other concerns. Pausing periodically during these conversations can be helpful to avoid overwhelming the patient and family. This can be done by asking questions such as [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is it like to talk about all these hard things? </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We&rsquo;ve talked about some difficult things today; is there anything I&rsquo;ve said that isn&rsquo;t as clear as it might be?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It seems that what I&rsquo;ve said may have not been what you&rsquo;d expected? </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How are you doing with this?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H416337\"><span class=\"h2\">Time</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When patients ask about their impending mortality, the use of open-ended questions can clarify the prognostic question he or she is most interested in having answered. This can help the clinician focus on the kind of information a patient wants, rather than information he or she may find relatively unhelpful (eg, statistics about prognosis). </p><p>For example, if the patient asks about how much time they have left, the clinician may follow-up with: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When people ask this question they often have something particular in mind, for example, a family event or a trip that they want to participate in.

As an example, a clinician could respond to such questions with the following: &ldquo;There are different ways I can answer you, so help me think about what might be best for you.

Caregivers may have increased responsibilities for childcare, care of older adults, and management of household tasks, as well as care of the patient and the burdens imposed by anticipatory grief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. However, caregivers play a major role in how patients cope with their life-limiting illness. (See <a href=\"#H13271165\" class=\"local\">'Family and social support'</a> below.)</p><p>Family members often make major life changes in the course of caring for patients with terminal illness. Many families report loss of family savings and income when spouses or others quit work to provide care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. The emotional toll on family members can lead to depression and stress-related symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. In addition, caregivers may neglect their own health care, missing routine screening appointments or follow-up care for chronic conditions. Patients frequently feel responsible for bringing these burdens on family members. </p><p>Clinicians can help address these concerns through interventions that require only modest effort. These include simply asking caregivers how they are holding up, considering ways to help, such as by arranging additional home services for patients, and encouraging them to include self-care activities. These interventions have been shown to be helpful in reducing psychological symptoms in caregivers of patients in palliative care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>], which in turn can help relieve some of the concerns on the part of patients themselves.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13274864\"><span class=\"h2\">Grief and loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serious illness causes patients to confront current and anticipated physical loss, as well as changes in role functioning and relationships. As the disease progresses, patients and their families must adjust to these changes and reestablish a new equilibrium. Values, spiritual beliefs, personality style, characteristic methods of coping, and family traditions all influence the way a person comes to terms with a terminal prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p>Grief is an intrinsic part of the human response to loss. For the patient, grief may entail reassessment of the scope of personal accomplishments, mourning for the loss of a desired future, and relinquishing many of the roles that have sustained a sense of purpose. There is considerable variation in sequencing and intensity of grief reactions; many patients do not proceed in a linear fashion through the stages of grief and may skip certain stages or revisit previously experienced stages based on triggers that emerge. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=grief-and-bereavement-in-adults-clinical-features#H119191330\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Grief and bereavement in adults: Clinical features&quot;, section on 'Course'</a>.)</p><p>Following the death of a loved one, research suggests that survivors experience a pattern in which disbelief peaks at one month, yearning at four months, anger at five months, and depression at six months post loss. This suggests that surviving loved ones who continue to have intense, pervasive, unmitigated, or persistent negative effects for seven or more months might benefit from psychosocial evaluation and treatment.

Hope permits patients, their families, and loved ones to cope with these difficult emotions and helps them endure the stresses of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. However, the desire for hope may conflict with the desire for full disclosure of the prognosis. Patients often oscillate between the two, struggling to find a sense of emotional equilibrium. </p><p>Hope is not dependent upon undoing what cannot be changed or deceiving patients about the future. It is founded on trust, connection, and preservation of dignity, identity, and the sense of self. In the face of such struggles and clinical uncertainty about the imminence of death, it is often difficult for clinicians to imagine how hope can be maintained in the face of conversations about death, prognosis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> moving beyond curative treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. However, engaging in direct discussion with the patient regarding feelings of hopelessness and helplessness acknowledges reality while offering a professional relationship within which these feelings may be managed.</p><p>An approach where the clinician relays hopes for the best while also considering feared outcomes permits the patient and family to acknowledge the gravity of the disease while being able to find meaning and purpose in the remaining time. In addition, the clinician can nurture hope by confronting problems directly, conveying a caring attitude, focusing on achievable short-term goals, and involving the patient as an active partner in care. </p><p>Other measures that may help support hope for these patients include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness/abstract/51-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-55</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Engaging in conversations about their values and what gives their lives meaning.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supporting the patient&rsquo;s wholeness and personhood whenever possible.

Friends and relatives take care of the patient. However, in the context of a terminal illness, even well-functioning families can become destabilized by grief, helplessness, and exhaustion. Alternatively, individuals who are designated as health care proxies may experience an emotional burden when asked to make decisions for a terminally ill loved one [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advance-care-planning-and-advance-directives#H616076112\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advance care planning and advance directives&quot;, section on 'Surrogate decision makers'</a>.)</p><p>A family&rsquo;s resilience under stressful conditions seems dependent on their committed attachment to each other, their ability to communicate and disagree without rupturing the bonds of affection and respect, and a capacity to solve problems and make decisions in a cooperative way [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Although there is limited empirical research, family theory and clinical experience support the value of an assessment of family functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. </p><p>Questions that can be used to assess family function are listed below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness/abstract/10,57,59-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,57,59-63</a>]. These questions do not necessarily need to be addressed to the terminally ill patient; they can alternatively be directed to other family members if the patient is unable to participate in discussions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Can you tell me what has happened since your loved one was diagnosed?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How has <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> illness affected you?

Spirituality often helps people accommodate and cope with the illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness/abstract/65-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">65-68</a>], adjust to disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>], and feel less depressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>].

Denial is always contextual. The context might be a crisis, such as disease progression, or an attempt to preserve the status quo in familial or treatment relationships. Although denial may lead to rigid avoidance of difficult new realities, it may alternatively enable the patient to preserve functioning, particularly if he or she is able to partially acknowledge bad news [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness/abstract/74-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">74-76</a>].</p><p>When confronted with a patient&rsquo;s denial, the clinician can consider the following question: &ldquo;Is denial helping the patient to deal with the illness, or is it interfering with that patient&rsquo;s ability to seek appropriate care and preserve significant relationships?&rdquo;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If denial is interfering with care, relationships, or end of life planning, the clinician should address it with gentle but direct statements such as: &ldquo;I know that thinking about this now is painful, but I want to help you have as much control as possible over this important decision.

In contrast, people with personality disorders display chronic, dysfunctional patterns of behavior in interpersonal relationships and are unable to modulate feelings and behavior. These difficult interpersonal styles generally persist and may complicate medical care and relationships with loved ones in the setting of advanced illness.

Delirium is frequently confused with depression, psychosis, or anxiety and should be considered as part of the differential diagnosis whenever changes in mood, behavior, or cognition are being evaluated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness/abstract/119,120\" class=\"abstract_t\">119,120</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-symptom-assessment-in-palliative-care#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to symptom assessment in palliative care&quot;, section on 'Psychological and cognitive symptoms'</a>.)</p><p>As with other symptoms at the end of life, the patients and families&rsquo; goals for care should determine the extent of the diagnostic evaluation and the choice of treatment. It should also be noted that underlying pain may be the trigger for delirium, and interventions to manage pain may improve symptoms of delirium. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=delirium-and-acute-confusional-states-prevention-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Delirium and acute confusional states: Prevention, treatment, and prognosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-managing-common-non-pain-symptoms-in-palliative-care#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of managing common non-pain symptoms in palliative care&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H284832440\"><span class=\"h1\">COMMUNICATION WITH THE FAMILY OR OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PATIENT&rsquo;S SOCIAL NETWORK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians should gain an understanding of the patient and his or her loved ones, which can inform how he or she communicates with them. In addition, clinicians should be aware that sometimes the need for information differs between patients and their loved ones. Some patients and families wish to learn about all the risks and benefits of relevant treatment options and to serve as active partners in decision making. Others may simply prefer that the clinician make the decision, especially if patients are overwhelmed. Being aware and understanding the differences between the patient&rsquo;s needs and those of their loved ones can help the clinician communicate in this stressful period. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=a-patient-centered-view-of-the-clinician-patient-relationship#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;A patient-centered view of the clinician-patient relationship&quot;, section on 'Communication between patient and providers'</a>.)</p><p>For patients who are unable to communicate with their clinicians (eg, due to the disease itself, a reduced level of consciousness, or delirium), any of the above questions discussed may also be posed to the family or other close individuals, particularly in situations where the patient no longer has decision-making capacity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Legal aspects in palliative and end of life care in the United States&quot;, section on 'Decision-making capacity'</a>.)</p><p>For the parent of dependent children who is nearing the end of life, both the patient and his or her well spouse frequently have questions about how to talk to their children about the illness and impending death. The approach to preparing children for the impending death of a parent is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparing-children-for-the-loss-of-a-loved-one\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preparing children for the loss of a loved one&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H284832446\"><span class=\"h1\">COMMUNICATING WITH PATIENTS ABOUT THE END OF LIFE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians should not shy away from end of life discussions, particularly for those facing a life-limiting illness. Several studies of end of life discussions found no evidence that conversations about prognosis were associated with increased emotional distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>]. Rather, patients who reported discussions with their clinicians were more likely to acknowledge that they were terminally ill and less likely to receive invasive procedures within the last week of life or to die in the intensive care unit.</p><p>Unfortunately, the data suggest that patients nearing the end of life often are not aware of the gravity of their particular situation. For example, in a large cohort study of patients with metastatic lung and colorectal cancer, 69 percent of patients with lung and 81 percent of patients with colorectal cancer did not understand that chemotherapy was not at all likely to cure their cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>]. Although comparative studies are presently lacking, it is plausible that patients with chronic diseases (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], chronic renal or heart failure) may have even less of an understanding of the realities and prognosis of their illness compared with patients with a terminal cancer or neurodegenerative disorder. This may be due to a waxing and waning disease tempo marked by periods of apparent stability, sudden acute deteriorations, and then a return to a lower plateau [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>]. For clinicians, the attention required to manage complex and acute symptoms combined with difficulty in predicting the illness trajectory may lead patients and families to behave as if the pattern of near misses will continue indefinitely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness/abstract/60,124-129\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,124-129</a>]. This may result in a delay or avoidance of discussions of end of life goals and values until the patient is actively dying. When patients and families are not aware of a shortened prognosis, they are likely to be unprepared as they face issues at the end of life and less able to invoke adaptive coping strategies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness/abstract/130\" class=\"abstract_t\">130</a>].</p><p>The approach to conversation can influence whether or not a patient engages in discussion about prognosis and end of life. This was examined in a 2014 systematic review that included 19 studies in its analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness/abstract/131\" class=\"abstract_t\">131</a>]. Among their findings were that:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fishing questions (eg, &ldquo;Is there anything else you&rsquo;d like to talk about?&rdquo;) were rarely effective in getting patients to talk about difficult future matters.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overtly linking questions and future plan discussions directly to what patients have said or have not said (eg, &ldquo;You mentioned you were afraid of pain at the end of life, is that still something you are concerned about?&rdquo;) appear to be effective ways to encourage patients to talk about the future and to actively engage in planning for subsequent care.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypothetical questioning (eg, &ldquo;Say you got really sick and could not make decisions, who would you want to make decisions for you?&rdquo;) appears to be a powerful and effective way to encourage patients to discuss difficult topics.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Silence can be an effective means to deepen conversations. Silence allows emotions to rise to the surface so that they can be processed and discussed. In normal discourse, people rarely leave gaps of longer than 0.3 seconds following a question, and gaps longer than a second are otherwise rare, unless it is due to another activity (eg, recordkeeping). Because people have a low tolerance for silence in conversation, silent pauses can work to encourage talk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shifting topics from &ldquo;negative&rdquo; topics (eg, delivering bad news) to &ldquo;positive&rdquo; ones (eg, hope and perseverance) may suppress further talk about difficult issues.</p><p/><p>Similarly, others have proposed a checklist approach to discussion of serious illness care goals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness/abstract/132\" class=\"abstract_t\">132</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=discussing-goals-of-care#H3563349352\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Discussing goals of care&quot;, section on 'Essential elements'</a>.) &#160;</p><p>These data suggest that clinicians can initiate discussions regarding prognosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> end of life in a number of ways and that no one approach is optimal in all situations. Through sensitive communication with seriously ill patients, clinicians can help their patients toward living as well as possible with a serious illness and, ultimately, to an &ldquo;appropriate death&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness/abstract/133\" class=\"abstract_t\">133</a>], which can be described as &ldquo;a death one might choose, had one a choice.&rdquo; The goal for most patients is to live &ldquo;as well as possible,&rdquo; and communication is a critical element that allows patients to retain a sense of personal significance, wholeness, and self-esteem, which enable this priority to be actualized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness/abstract/134\" class=\"abstract_t\">134</a>]. Discussions about serious illness improve quality of life for patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness/abstract/134-136\" class=\"abstract_t\">134-136</a>] as well as for their families, particularly surrogate decision-makers, who experience less distress when they know which treatments are consistent with the patient&rsquo;s preferences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychosocial concerns are nearly universal among patients who have advanced life-threatening illnesses. Patients face challenges to their sense of wholeness. The ways in which people respond to these threats to personal integrity range from highly effective strategies for coping to dysfunctional reactions, often in the same person at different times. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinician plays an important role in the care of patients in palliative care by helping them to identify sources of meaning and purpose and by providing support for their feelings, including sadness about saying goodbye or worries about failing loved ones by feeling ready to die. Of note, the clinician does not need to do this alone and may call upon chaplains, mental health providers, and palliative care colleagues as needed. (See <a href=\"#H284829448\" class=\"local\">'The clinician&rsquo;s role'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is important that clinicians be aware of their own feelings toward their patients. A lack of awareness of one&rsquo;s own negative emotions or harboring strongly positive feelings about a patient can prompt a variety of maladaptive responses on the part of the clinician. (See <a href=\"#H284832149\" class=\"local\">'Importance of self-awareness'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>By understanding how a patient views the meaning of life, clinicians may determine the sense of the patient and family&rsquo;s values and experience of illness. In addition, it may also uncover spiritual or existential distress, disruptions in personal relationships, or the presence of depression, which may require the involvement of other members of the palliative care team (eg, spiritual leaders, psychologists, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> social workers). (See <a href=\"#H13274834\" class=\"local\">'The meaning of the illness'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other common issues for palliative care patients include the loss of dignity, increased dependence, fear of the future, concerns about time, and concerns about their loved ones and caregivers. (See <a href=\"#H13274808\" class=\"local\">'Common issues for patients with advanced illness'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coping refers to the characteristic ways in which a person maintains psychological and social equilibrium. Coping is moderated by multiple factors, including hope, family and social support, spiritual beliefs and religious communities, and denial. (See <a href=\"#H13271091\" class=\"local\">'Mediators of coping'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Understanding economic circumstances is important to addressing disparities in medical care, even among palliative care patients. In cancer care and in many other end-stage diseases, it appears that race, in synergy with lower socioeconomic status, limited access to health care, cultural beliefs, and low health literacy, perpetuate disparities in health care. (See <a href=\"#H13271224\" class=\"local\">'Economic circumstances'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinicians should gain an understanding of the patient and his or her loved ones, which can inform how he or she communicates with them. (See <a href=\"#H284832440\" class=\"local\">'Communication with the family or other members of the patient&rsquo;s social network'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>End of life discussions, particularly those that occur before the last month of life, are associated with improvements in quality of life, receipt of desired care, reduced physical suffering, improved family coping, and increased use of hospice; clinicians have a responsibility to raise these issues with patients as the disease begins to worsen. End of life and goals of care discussions may also increase patient satisfaction with care and decrease the likelihood of stress, anxiety, and depression among surviving caregivers.
