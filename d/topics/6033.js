The tissue inside the uterus is called &quot;endometrium&quot; and the tissue outside of the uterus is called &quot;endometriosis&quot;. The most common places where endometriosis occurs are the ovaries, the fallopian tubes, the bowel, and the areas in front, in back, and to the sides of the uterus.</p><p>Some women with endometriosis have few or no symptoms while others have pain or difficulty becoming pregnant. There is no cure for endometriosis, but there are several treatment options. The best treatment depends on your individual situation.</p><p>More detailed information about endometriosis is available by subscription. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Treatment of pelvic pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ENDOMETRIOSIS CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cause of endometriosis is not known. A common theory is that some menstrual blood and endometrium flows backwards from the uterus through the fallopian tubes and into the pelvis during a menstrual period (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F78942\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78942 \">figure 1</a>). This tissue then grows where it lands in the pelvis. This is called the retrograde menstruation theory. There are several other theories and there is ongoing research to find a cause for this condition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ENDOMETRIOSIS SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some women with endometriosis have no symptoms. The most common symptom is pain in the pelvic area, especially with periods.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pelvic pain caused by endometriosis can occur:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Just before or during the menstrual period. In some women, painful periods get worse over time. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=painful-menstrual-periods-dysmenorrhea-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Painful menstrual periods (dysmenorrhea) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Between menstrual periods, with worsened pain during the period</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During or after sex</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With bowel movements or while urinating, especially during the period</p><p/><p>Pelvic pain can be caused by many other conditions, including pelvic floor muscle spasm, pelvic infections, and irritable bowel syndrome. A doctor or nurse can help to figure out if endometriosis may be the cause of your pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Difficulty getting pregnant</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endometriosis can make it more difficult to become pregnant. This might occur because endometriosis may cause scar tissue to develop, which can damage the ovaries or fallopian tubes. Even women with endometriosis who do not have scar tissue can have difficulty becoming pregnant.</p><p>In women who become pregnant, endometriosis does not harm the pregnancy. Symptoms of endometriosis often improve after pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Endometriomas (chocolate cysts)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with endometriosis can develop ovarian cysts containing endometriosis; this is called an endometrioma. Endometriomas are usually filled with old blood that resembles chocolate syrup; thus, they are sometimes called chocolate cysts. Endometriomas are sometimes seen during a pelvic ultrasound or felt during a pelvic exam.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">ENDOMETRIOSIS DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse might suspect that you have endometriosis based on your symptoms of pelvic pain or painful menstrual periods. However, the only way to know for sure if you have endometriosis is to have surgery so a doctor can actually see and biopsy the abnormal tissue. Endometriosis cannot be diagnosed by ultrasound, x-ray, or other non-invasive methods.</p><p>Endometriosis is considered mild, moderate, or severe depending on what is found during surgery. Women with mild disease can have severe symptoms, and women with severe disease can have mild symptoms.</p><p>In some cases, your doctor will recommend a medicine as the first treatment for symptoms that make her suspect endometriosis. This might include a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medicine <span class=\"nowrap\">(ibuprofen/Advil)</span> or hormonal birth control. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Endometriosis treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>If treatment does not improve your pain within three to six months, another type of medication may be tried, or surgery can be discussed as a reasonable next step. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> below.)</p><p>In other cases, surgery is performed to diagnose endometriosis and remove it before you take any medicine. Talk to your doctor or nurse about which approach is right for your situation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">ENDOMETRIOSIS TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several treatment options for women with endometriosis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hormonal birth control</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other forms of hormone treatment (gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery</p><p/><p>The best treatment depends on your future plans to become pregnant and what symptoms are most bothersome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are a type of pain medicine that can help to relieve the pain caused by endometriosis. The medicine works by stopping the release of prostaglandins, one of the main chemicals responsible for pain in general as well as painful menstrual periods. Starting these medications one to two days before your period works best to prevent prostaglandin production and therefore reduce pain. It may take some time, and several doses, for the NSAIDs to block the prostaglandin production and reduce pain. NSAIDs do not shrink or prevent the growth of endometriosis.</p><p>Most NSAIDs are available without a prescription, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ibuprofen (sold as Advil, Motrin, and store brands). Follow the package instructions. In general, two tablets are taken for the first dose and one tablet every four to six hours, as needed, thereafter. These should be taken with food and may be most effective if started one to two days before the onset of pain. Physicians may prescribe higher doses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Naproxen sodium (sold as Aleve, Anaprox, Naprosyn, and store brands). Follow the package instructions, as the dose and frequency differ depending on the formulation. In general, two tablets are taken for the first dose, and one tablet is taken every 8 to 12 hours, as needed, thereafter, depending on the formulation. All tablets should be taken with food and a full glass of water. Like ibuprofen, naproxen may be more effective if begun a day or two prior to the onset of typical menstrual pain. Physicians may prescribe higher doses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If over-the-counter NSAIDs are not effective, prescription doses and formulations may be helpful.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The disadvantage of NSAIDs is that they do not always relieve endometriosis-related pain. NSAIDs probably work better when combined with another treatment, like hormonal birth control. Serious side effects from NSAIDs, although uncommon, include stomach upset, kidney problems, and worsened high blood pressure.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Hormonal birth control treatments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hormonal birth control, including the pill, patch, and the vaginal ring are often helpful in treating pain because they reduce heavy bleeding. Injectable and implantable long-acting progestins may be very effective in managing endometriosis-related pain. A progestin-containing intrauterine device can also be very effective in treating pain. Hormonal birth control works best in women who do not have severe pain unrelated to the period.</p><p>Women with endometriosis are often advised to take hormonal birth control continuously (skipping the placebo pills) for three or more months. This allows you to have fewer periods and have less pain and bleeding during each period. This is explained in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hormonal-methods-of-birth-control-beyond-the-basics#H15\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Hormonal methods of birth control (Beyond the Basics)&quot;, section on 'Continuous dosing'</a>.)</p><p>The most common side effects of estrogen-containing hormonal birth control are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breast tenderness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting</p><p/><p>These side effects usually improve after using the treatment for several months. Serious side effects (eg, blood clots, stroke, heart attack) are rare in women who do not smoke. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hormonal-methods-of-birth-control-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Hormonal methods of birth control (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Progestins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Progestins are a synthetic form of a natural hormone called progesterone. This treatment might be recommended for women who do not get pain relief from or who cannot take hormonal birth control that contains estrogen (such as smokers). Progestins are available by prescription and usually given as a pill or injection. Progestins are not used if you are trying to become pregnant. A progestin-containing intrauterine device delivers very low levels of progestin directly to the uterus and results in markedly lighter and less painful bleeding episodes with fewer systemic side effects.</p><p>Side effects of progestins can be bothersome for some women. The most common side effects include: bloating, weight gain, irregular vaginal bleeding, acne, and rarely, worsened depression.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists are medicines that work by causing a temporary menopause. The treatment causes the ovaries to stop producing estrogen, which causes the endometriosis implants to shrink.</p><p>This treatment reduces pain in over 80 percent of women, including women with severe pain. GnRH agonists are not used if you are trying to become pregnant.</p><p>Examples of GnRH agonists include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nafarelin (Synarel) - Nasal spray taken twice per day</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leuprolide (Lupron) - Shot taken once every one or three months</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Goserelin (Zoladex) - Shot taken once every 28 days</p><p/><p>Adult women can take the full dose of a GnRH agonist for up to 12 months. There are concerns about using GnRH agonists at full strength for more than 12 months. Women who use GnRH agonists lose bone density, and this can become serious over time. One way to minimize bone loss is to take hormonal &quot;add-back&quot; treatment (adding very small amounts of either estrogen or a synthetic progestin) in addition to the GnRH agonist.</p><p>Taking hormonal add-back can also help to treat the most common side effects of GnRH agonists, which are menopausal symptoms (hot flashes, vaginal dryness, decreased libido, insomnia). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-long-term-treatment-with-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-agonists\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Long-term treatment with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2872791509\"><span class=\"h2\">Aromatase inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These drugs block the enzyme (aromatase) that increases estrogen levels in tissue. There is increasing evidence that endometriosis tissue makes its own aromatase. &#160;</p><p>Examples of aromatase inhibitors include letrozole and anastrozole. Both medications are pills that are taken once a day. Combining these drugs with hormonal birth control, progestins, or GnRH agonists may be more effective than any of them alone. This may be a strategy for long-term management of endometriosis pain in women who are not attempting pregnancy since the side effects appear minimal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometriosis-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery might be an option to treat endometriosis if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have severe pain </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have tried medicines but still have bothersome pain (attributable to endometriosis)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a growth or mass in the pelvic area. Surgery may be necessary to remove the mass and figure out if endometriosis, or another problem, is the cause.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are having trouble getting pregnant and endometriosis might be the cause. </p><p/><p>The goal of surgery is to remove endometriosis implants and scar tissue. More than 80 percent of women who have surgery have less pain for several months after surgery. However, there is a good chance that the pain will come back unless you take some form of treatment after surgery (like hormonal birth control).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Laparoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laparoscopy is one way to perform surgery, and is commonly used to diagnose and treat endometriosis. During laparoscopy, a doctor makes several small cuts to place instruments inside the abdomen and pelvis. One of these instruments has a light and camera, which allows the doctor to see the organs on a screen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment of an endometrioma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medicines are unlikely to make an endometrioma go away. Surgery to remove the endometrioma if it is larger than 4 to 5 cm, symptomatic or enlarging, is usually recommended because surgery can confirm the diagnosis, prevent complications (such as rupture of the endometrioma), and treat any symptoms, such as pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Management of ovarian endometriomas&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Removal of the uterus or ovaries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor might recommend surgery to remove your uterus or ovaries or both if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have tried other treatments but continue to have severe symptoms</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You do not want to become pregnant in the future</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You want a permanent treatment</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to remove the uterus is called hysterectomy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-hysterectomy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Abdominal hysterectomy (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to remove the ovaries and fallopian tubes is called salpingo-oophorectomy. It is not always necessary to remove the ovaries to treat endometriosis; this decision will depend on your age and your preferences.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Hormone therapy after surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your ovaries are removed, your doctor or nurse might recommend hormone therapy (estrogen) after surgery. This is especially true for women under age 50 who are not yet menopausal. Estrogen can help to minimize menopausal symptoms like hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, and bone loss and reduce the long-term health consequences of surgical menopause.
