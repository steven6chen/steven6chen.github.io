The cervix is the part of a woman&rsquo;s body where the uterus and the vagina meet. It is the bottom part of the uterus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80271\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80271 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>To do a Pap test, your doctor or nurse will push apart the walls of your vagina using a device that looks like a duck beak (called a speculum). Then, he or she will use a small tool to gently scrape cells from your cervix. This might be a little uncomfortable, but usually will not hurt. The staff at a lab will look at the cells under a microscope to see if they are abnormal.</p><p>Do not assume that you are having a Pap test every time the doctor or nurse uses a speculum. That device &#160;the one that looks like a duck beak &#160;is used for other reasons, too. If the doctor or nurses uses a speculum, ask whether you are being checked for cervical cancer.</p><p>Pap tests can find cancer cells or cells that could turn into cancer, called &quot;precancer.&quot; Precancer can be treated to try to prevent cancer. The test can also usually find cancer in the early stages, when it can be treated or even cured.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31191752\"><span class=\"h1\">When should a woman start having Pap tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women should start having Pap tests when they turn 21. They do not need to be sexually active before they start getting Pap tests. When they turn 30, their doctors might also suggest doing another test to check for cervical cancer, called an HPV test. For this, the doctor or nurse takes cells from the cervix the same way they do for a Pap test.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31191759\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I do to prepare for a Pap test?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You do not need to do anything special to prepare for a Pap test. Women sometimes hear that they should not have sex or put anything in their vagina for 2 days before a Pap test, but it turns out that recommendation is not necessary. Pap tests work fine even in women who have had sex recently or who have used vaginal lubricants or creams.</p><p>Do not worry if you have your period on the day of the test. The test can still be done even if you are bleeding. If your bleeding is very heavy, you might want to call your doctor or nurse to see if you need to reschedule.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31191766\"><span class=\"h1\">How often should a woman have a Pap test?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on how old she is and what the results of her past Pap tests have been (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F89435\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89435 \">table 1</a>). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women age 21 to 29 should have a Pap test every 3 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women age 30 and older can have a Pap test every 3 years or a Pap test and HPV test every 5 years. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women age 65 and older should stop having Pap tests if they meet all of these requirements:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>They have never smoked.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>They do not have a new sex partner since their last Pap test.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>They had Pap tests done regularly until they turned 65.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>They had 3 normal Pap tests in a row.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>They had no abnormal Pap tests in the past 10 years.</p><p/><p>A woman might also get a Pap test if she has certain symptoms, such as vaginal bleeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31191773\"><span class=\"h1\">Do I need to get Pap tests if I had a hysterectomy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you had surgery called a &quot;hysterectomy&quot; to remove your uterus, ask your doctor if you need to keep having Pap tests. If you no longer have a cervix, and if you did not have cervical cancer before your hysterectomy, you most likely do not need to have Pap testing after surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31191780\"><span class=\"h1\">Do I need to get Pap tests if I had the HPV vaccine?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You still need to get Pap tests if you got the HPV vaccine. HPV stands for &quot;human papillomavirus.&quot; It is the virus that causes cervical cancer. Getting the HPV vaccine reduces your chances of getting cervical cancer. But it does not completely protect you. You still need to be checked for cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31191787\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I have an abnormal Pap test?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>First, you should know that abnormal Pap tests are common. They are just an initial test, and most women with an abnormal Pap test do not have cancer. If your Pap test has cells that look &quot;abnormal,&quot; your doctor or nurse can follow up with another test to find out for sure what is going on.</p><p>Depending on your age and the result of your Pap test, your doctor or nurse might order an HPV test done on the sample that he or she collected for the Pap test. The HPV test checks for infection with a type of HPV virus that can cause cancer.</p><p>Your doctor might also suggest that you have another follow-up Pap test or a test called a colposcopy. These are explained below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another Pap test at 6 to 12 months &ndash; Sometimes a Pap test shows cells that could be either normal or abnormal. If you wait a few months and have another Pap test, you could find that the cells are back to normal. You might also need an HPV test at the same time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A colposcopy &ndash; For this test, the doctor or nurse looks at your cervix using a device that looks like a microscope. It allows the doctor or nurse to see the cervix in fine detail. During this test, the doctor or nurse might also take tiny samples of tissue from the cervix. This is called a &quot;biopsy.&quot; Tissue from the biopsy can go to the lab and be checked for anything abnormal.</p><p/><p>If it turns out that you have cervical cancer or precancer, there are effective treatments available. If your condition was found early, there is a good chance you can be cured.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31191920\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cervical cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaginal cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-papillomavirus-hpv-vaccine-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-screening-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cancer screening (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-cancer-screening-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Cervical cancer screening (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=colposcopy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Colposcopy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-a-cervical-biopsy-with-precancerous-cells-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Management of a cervical biopsy with precancerous cells (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-cancer-treatment-early-stage-cancer-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Cervical cancer treatment; early-stage cancer (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fertility-preservation-in-women-with-early-stage-cervical-cancer-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Fertility preservation in women with early-stage cervical cancer (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=follow-up-of-high-grade-abnormal-pap-tests-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Follow-up of high-grade abnormal Pap tests (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
