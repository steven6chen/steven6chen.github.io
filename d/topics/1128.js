Blindness, especially if bilateral and permanent, represents a serious loss of function. Unfortunately, children may not present until they have significant loss of vision; very young children will not perceive declining vision until there is significant compromise and even school-age children compensate well. By the time vision loss is appreciated, the chance for recovery may be low.</p><p>The approach to acute vision loss in children will be reviewed here. The approach to vision loss in adults is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-persistent-visual-loss\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with acute persistent visual loss&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To achieve clear vision, light must follow an unhindered path from the front to the back of the eye, traveling through the cornea, aqueous humor, lens, and vitreous humor to the retina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F67844\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67844 \">figure 1</a>). Refracted by the cornea and lens (and perhaps also by glasses or contact lenses), light is focused onto the retina where it is transformed into an electrochemical signal by photoreceptors and supporting cells. The signal is transmitted via the optic nerve through the visual pathways to the occipital lobes.</p><p>Alterations in function of any of the structures along the visual pathway may cause vision loss. Pathology can be broadly divided into three major anatomic categories (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F61855\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61855 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Visual media problems &ndash; Disorders of the cornea, anterior chamber, lens, and vitreous (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F67844\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67844 \">figure 1</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retinal problems &ndash; Vascular occlusion, retinal detachment, and retinal tumors</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuro-visual pathway problems &ndash; Optic nerve, chiasmal, and retrochiasmal pathology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F74068\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74068 \">figure 2</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Visual media</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Open globe</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rupture or laceration of the globe from direct trauma is a common cause of acute vision loss that requires immediate ophthalmologic consultation. Paintball guns, BB guns, projectile toys, scissors, and recreational sharp objects are major culprits. Most victims are male. In many children, the injury is apparent on inspection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82383\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82383 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F80118\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80118 \">picture 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=open-globe-injuries-emergency-evaluation-and-initial-management#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Open globe injuries: Emergency evaluation and initial management&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>The approach to the patient with an open globe injury is summarized in a rapid overview (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F50022\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50022 \">table 2</a>). Aggressive examination of the eye is contraindicated when globe rupture is suspected, as forced opening can lead to extrusion of ocular contents. The best course of action before an ophthalmologist can evaluate the child is to protect the eye with a hard shield that avoids pressure on the intraocular contents and to elevate the head of the bed to 30 degrees. Any visible foreign body should be left in place (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F80118\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80118 \">picture 2</a>). Eye drops should be avoided. An antiemetic (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ondansetron-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ondansetron</a> 0.15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg;</span> maximum dose: 12 mg) is often prescribed to prevent vomiting and the associated increase in intraocular pressure. Intravenous pain medications (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fentanyl</a> 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg)</span> and sedation (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lorazepam</a> 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> maximum single dose: 4 mg) are often needed for pain and to prevent crying. The patient should be kept NPO (nil per os) for possible surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=open-globe-injuries-emergency-evaluation-and-initial-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Open globe injuries: Emergency evaluation and initial management&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Chemical burn</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Eye contact with acids or alkalis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56411\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56411 \">table 3</a>) requires emergent evaluation and treatment to prevent permanent vision loss. Burn severity depends on the agent involved, amount of exposure, and depth of penetration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-vision-loss-in-children/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Alkaline substances usually cause more severe damage than acids because of the ability to saponify phospholipid membranes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56411\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56411 \">table 3</a>). This action leads to rapid epithelial cell death and caustic penetration into the eye [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-vision-loss-in-children/abstract/1,3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3-5</a>]. Concentrated ammonia may cause anterior ocular structure injury after less than one minute of exposure, and lye can result in deep eye injury within three to five minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-vision-loss-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Acid burns cause coagulation necrosis that may result in extensive corneal scarring and ulceration that also pose a significant threat to vision.</p><p>Patients with chemical eye burns present with decreased vision, moderate to severe eye pain, blepharospasm (inability to open the eyelids), conjunctival redness, and photophobia. In severe cases of alkaline exposure, the eye may appear white due to ischemia of the conjunctiva and scleral vessels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67858\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67858 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p>Emergent and thorough irrigation with sterile normal saline or water is mandatory until the pH of the tears is 6.5 to 7.5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-vision-loss-in-children/abstract/1,2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,5</a>]. Topical (eg, 0.5 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=proparacaine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">proparacaine</a>, one drop into the affected eye) and intravenous analgesia (eg, IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">morphine</a> sulfate 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per dose) along with passive restraint facilitate irrigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-vision-loss-in-children/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]. The eyelids should be retracted for maximal exposure of the conjunctiva and cornea. Prolonged irrigation is best administered using a polymethylmethacrylate scleral lens (eg, Morgan&trade; lens), if available (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51399\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51399 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74905\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74905 \">picture 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63134\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63134 \">picture 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53892\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53892 \">picture 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-vision-loss-in-children/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Most experts recommend that irrigation be performed initially for 30 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-vision-loss-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The pH is then checked at the fornix (region between the conjunctiva and the lower eyelid). If the pH is still abnormal, then irrigation resumes for another 30 minutes. If the pH is normal, it should be remeasured at five minutes and then again at 30 minutes to ensure no recurrence of a pH imbalance. Care should be taken when concomitant globe rupture is suspected; irrigation should be more gentle and less forceful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-vision-loss-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Some ophthalmologists also recommend a topical collagenase inhibitor based on experimental animal models showing benefits in rabbits and mice (eg, CaEDTA, N-acetylcysteine, thymosin beta 4, and metalloproteinase inhibitors) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-vision-loss-in-children/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. These agents act to minimize secondary inflammation and further damage to the eye [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-vision-loss-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, human data is very limited, and these agents are not widely available for ocular use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Conjunctivitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute vision loss occurs rarely in children with infectious conjunctivitis, except for newborns with gonococcal conjunctivitis. However, differentiating conjunctivitis from keratitis (corneal inflammation), especially in patients who wear contacts or are suspected of Herpes simplex virus infection, is a major concern. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=conjunctivitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Conjunctivitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gonococcal-infection-in-the-newborn#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gonococcal infection in the newborn&quot;, section on 'Ophthalmia neonatorum'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-red-eye#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the red eye&quot;, section on 'Infectious keratitis'</a>.)</p><p>Chlamydia trachomatis is the most frequent infectious cause of vision loss in developing countries, but trachoma is a more chronic condition, characterized by primary infection in childhood and the development of blindness during adulthood caused by corneal scarring from entropion and trichiasis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trachoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trachoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Keratitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infectious keratitis (inflammation of the cornea) is most commonly caused by bacteria (especially Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), Herpes simplex virus, and adenovirus (epidemic keratoconjunctivitis or EKC).</p><p>Bacterial keratitis occurs almost exclusively in contact lens wearers and may progress to corneal ulceration with hypopyon within 24 hours (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53237\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53237 \">picture 7</a>). The diagnostic finding in bacterial keratitis is a corneal opacity or infiltrate (typically a round white spot) in association with red eye, photophobia, and foreign body sensation. Treatment requires urgent ophthalmological referral and prompt initiation of topical bactericidal antibiotics (ideally after obtaining cultures). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-red-eye#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the red eye&quot;, section on 'Bacterial keratitis'</a>.)</p><p>Primary herpes simplex virus keratoconjunctivitis is characterized by a dendritic pattern on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fluorescein</a> staining of the cornea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55593\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55593 \">picture 8</a>). Multiple recurrences can lead to disciform scarring and subsequent vision loss. Although typically a self-limited process, duration of symptoms is reduced by topical or oral antiviral agents. Patients should be referred to an ophthalmologist within a few days for confirmation of diagnosis, ongoing vision monitoring, and possible addition of adjunctive topical glucocorticoid steroid therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=herpes-simplex-keratitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Herpes simplex keratitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-red-eye#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the red eye&quot;, section on 'Viral keratitis'</a>.)</p><p>Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) or adenoviral keratitis is typically a self-limited process without sequelae. However, patients can be quite miserable during active disease because of photophobia and foreign body sensation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F80243\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80243 \">picture 9</a>). Rapid testing for adenovirus infection may help differentiate EKC from other types of keratitis. Referral to an ophthalmologist within days is warranted for confirmation of the diagnosis, vision monitoring, and treatment for those patients with decline in vision caused by subepithelial corneal infiltrates.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Hyphema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A rapid overview summarizes the important clinical features and initial management of a traumatic hyphema (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74146\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74146 \">table 4</a>).</p><p>Hyphema, a collection of blood in the anterior chamber of the eye, typically results from blunt trauma to the eye in children (eg, hit by tennis ball or baseball). In addition to a hyphema, small objects (eg, paper clips, nails) tend to cause corneal abrasions or globe perforation, and large, hard objects (eg, fist, baseballs) often result in orbital fractures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78964%7EEM%2F59855\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78964 graphicRef59855 \">picture 10A-B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71507\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71507 \">picture 11</a>). Spontaneous hyphema occurs rarely in children.</p><p>A large hyphema may be noticeable when looking at the patient. In most instances, simply shining a tangential light into the anterior chamber reveals the characteristic crescenteric accumulation of blood. Diagnosis of a small, or microhyphema, requires the use of a slit lamp. The size of the hyphema correlates with visual outcome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60334\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60334 \">figure 4</a>). Permanent vision loss is also associated with the development of rebleeding or acute glaucoma. Patients with sickle hemoglobinopathies or bleeding disorder are at highest risk for permanent sequelae. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=traumatic-hyphema-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Traumatic hyphema: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with a grade I or greater hyphema, sickle cell disease or trait, bleeding dyscrasia, or concern for an open globe need emergent evaluation by an ophthalmologist. In otherwise healthy children with a microhyphema, discussion with an ophthalmologist is recommended to address appropriate management and to ensure timely follow-up. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=traumatic-hyphema-management#H714240904\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Traumatic hyphema: Management&quot;, section on 'Ophthalmologic management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Iritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Iritis is a form of anterior uveitis that causes pain, photophobia, and sometimes vision loss. Traumatic iritis is not uncommon in children with blunt periorbital injuries. Other causes, such as rheumatologic conditions, tend to present subacutely or chronically. Slit lamp and funduscopic examination is necessary to establish the presence of uveitis. Treatment of traumatic iritis consists of cycloplegia (pharmacologic pupillary dilation), topical steroid drops (only for patients under the care of an ophthalmologist), and management of associated injuries. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uveitis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uveitis: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=traumatic-hyphema-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Traumatic hyphema: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=traumatic-hyphema-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Traumatic hyphema: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Glaucoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glaucoma defines a group of eye diseases that is traditionally characterized by elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and is most prevalent in adults. Glaucoma occurs rarely in childhood and may present with a painful red eye. Children may also demonstrate photophobia, a cloudy cornea, or if under three years of age at onset, buphthalmos (an enlarged eye). Older children usually complain of visual loss. Early diagnosis and referral are crucial to ensure optimal visual outcome.</p><p>Pediatric glaucoma is classified into primary and secondary types to provide a framework for the evaluation and management of individual patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56982\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56982 \">table 5</a>). Primary glaucomas are those with isolated angle malformations (trabeculodysgenesis). Secondary glaucoma either is acquired or related to an underlying ocular abnormality; it can occur at any age and may be present at birth. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of glaucoma in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Classification'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Lens abnormality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Changes in the clarity, or positioning (ectopic lentis) of the crystalline lens may alter the focus of light onto the retina, resulting in visual disturbance. Ectopic lentis is seen in pediatric patients with familial or idiopathic ectopia lentis, homocystinuria, Marfan syndrome, and trauma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77130\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77130 \">picture 12</a>). Lens clouding (cataract) does not occur acutely, except in the setting of trauma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ectopia-lentis-dislocated-lens-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ectopia lentis (dislocated lens) in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Vitreous hemorrhage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trauma is the major cause of bleeding into the vitreous humor in children. In particular, abusive head trauma often results in this injury which may appear as a dome shaped hemorrhage that obscures the retina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69754\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69754 \">picture 13</a>). Other rare causes include spontaneous retinal tear, spontaneous vitreous detachment, and retinal neovascularization (as in poorly controlled diabetes). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=child-abuse-eye-findings-in-children-with-abusive-head-trauma-aht\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Child abuse: Eye findings in children with abusive head trauma (AHT)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>On physical examination, the reduction in vision is directly proportional to the amount of blood in the vitreous. If the hemorrhage is dense enough, there may be a decreased red reflex (the reddish orange reflection of light off of the retina when examining the eye with an ophthalmoscope), or the retina may not be visible with ophthalmoscopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Endophthalmitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endophthalmitis (internal eye infection) may complicate open globe injuries, eye surgery, and keratitis and is typically caused by surface pathogens. Patients present with decreased vision, pain, and red eye. A hypopyon may be detected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F51972\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51972 \">picture 14</a>). Treatment consists of empiric broad spectrum antibiotics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vancomycin</a> 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV, maximum dose: 1 g and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftazidime-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ceftazidime</a> 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV, maximum dose: 2 g), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> antifungal agents (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Fluconazole</a> orally, amphotericin B IV, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">voriconazole</a> IV). Emergent ophthalmologic consultation for possible intravitreal treatment <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vitrectomy is indicated.

Retinal injury rarely occurs spontaneously (eg, as a late complication of retinopathy of prematurity) or in the setting of unintentional trauma. Verbal patients may describe sudden onset of new floaters or black dots in their vision, often accompanied by flashes of light (photopsias). In its early stages, a detachment may present as a persistent missing portion of the monocular visual field. Once the macula (central retina) has become involved, visual acuity will be severely compromised. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retinal-detachment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retinal detachment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=child-abuse-eye-findings-in-children-with-abusive-head-trauma-aht\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Child abuse: Eye findings in children with abusive head trauma (AHT)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Retinal detachment is not painful, and does not cause a red eye.

If the detachment is extensive, there may be a relative afferent pupillary defect (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F71937\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71937 \">figure 5</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Central retinal artery occlusion</strong> &ndash; Although rare in pediatrics, central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) presents with sudden, painless, severe, central <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> paracentral monocular vision loss. In children and adolescents, retinal arterial occlusion is associated with sickle cell disease, congenital heart disease with right to left shunting, hypercoagulable states, thrombotic disorders, intravenous drug abuse, migraine, ocular trauma, pregnancy, and vasculitis (eg, immunoglobulin A vasculitis [Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura], systemic lupus erythematosus).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Within minutes to hours of the occlusion, the only abnormality noted on ophthalmoscopy may be vascular narrowing. An embolus is visible in about 20 percent of patients with CRAO. After several hours, the inner layer of the retina becomes ischemic, turning milky white, except in the fovea which appears as a cherry-red spot (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F51342\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51342 \">picture 16</a>) when compared with the unaffected eye (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F66013\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66013 \">picture 17</a>).

The cause of central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) is often unknown. Thrombosis of the central retinal vein results in venous stasis, leading to disc swelling, diffuse nerve fiber layer and preretinal hemorrhage, and cotton wool spots that create a dramatic appearance, often called &quot;the blood and thunder&quot; fundus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F72976\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72976 \">picture 18</a>).

When venous stasis is severe, infarction may occur due to slowed retinal blood flow on the arterial side. In this setting, a relative afferent pupillary defect is often present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F71937\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71937 \">figure 5</a>).

Sinusitis is the most common risk factor for orbital cellulitis because of the proximity of the ethmoid sinus to the orbit and the thin layer of bone (lamina papyracea) that separates the two spaces.

The diagnosis of orbital cellulitis is made by a combination of physical examination, including visual acuity and ocular motility assessment, and radiologic assessment with computed tomography of the orbit. Orbital infection warrants timely consultation with an ophthalmologist and otorhinolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat surgeon). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=orbital-cellulitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Orbital cellulitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Complications of orbital cellulitis may develop rapidly and include localized abscesses of the subperiosteal bone and orbit, abscess extension to the orbital apex with visual loss (orbital apex syndrome), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> extension intracranially via the valveless venous system resulting in intracranial abscess, meningitis, or cavernous sinus thrombosis.

There may be no external signs of orbital infection other than vision loss. Sphenoid sinusitis, in particular, may be complicated by the orbital apex syndrome, due to the anatomic proximity of the sphenoid sinus to the optic canal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-vision-loss-in-children/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Sphenoid sinusitis is easily misdiagnosed, because it can present with headache alone and without upper respiratory symptoms. Rarely, sphenoid sinus mucocele can exert pressure on the optic nerve with resultant vision loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-vision-loss-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cavernous sinus thrombosis</strong> &ndash; Septic thrombosis of the cavernous sinuses can lead to vision loss due to vascular compression of the optic nerve or thrombosis of ophthalmic vessels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61214\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61214 \">figure 6</a>). The septic emboli initiating the thrombosis most commonly originate in infections involving the sinuses, face, ears, or oral cavity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-vision-loss-in-children/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Orbital neoplasms</strong> &ndash; Neuroblastoma may metastasize to the orbital tissues, sometimes resulting in proptosis or periorbital ecchymosis and, rarely, can present with blindness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-vision-loss-in-children/abstract/16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-20</a>].

Rhabdomyosarcoma most often presents in the head and neck region, and loss of vision may be the first sign of such a tumor. Because rhabdomyosarcoma tends to be a slow-growing tumor, vision typically declines gradually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-vision-loss-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Untreated IIH can result in permanent vision loss due to increased pressure on the optic nerve, typically affecting peripheral vision. However, complete visual loss can happen at any time during the course of the illness. Treatment is aimed at rapid reduction of pressure on the optic nerve.

These tumors typically represent pilocytic astrocytomas and grow slowly. However, significant visual field deficits are a potential indication for chemotherapy. Rarely, more rapid growth or hemorrhage can occur, compromising vision significantly. Optic pathway gliomas also arise in the optic chiasm, hypothalamus, or anterior third ventricle.

Peripheral vision loss is often asymptomatic until visual acuity is compromised. Thus, most visual complaints are of gradual blurring or dimming of vision. Sudden chiasmal vision loss is less common, and implies a rapidly expanding mass, or an infectious, vascular, or inflammatory cause.

Extensive bilateral damage to the cerebral visual pathways (eg, following prolonged hypoxia or shock) may result in complete loss of vision (cortical blindness).

Headache and positive visual phenomena, such as scintillations, usually occur in these patients. The classic migraine aura typically lasts 20 to 30 minutes, rarely as long as an hour, and has a characteristic build-up, or evolution, a feature lacking in other causes of TBVL (eg, seizure).

Hemiclonic activity, automatisms, migraine-like headache, and aversive movements may also occur, and seizures may secondarily generalize. An abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) confirms the diagnosis. Antiepileptic drug treatment is more often prescribed than in other partial epilepsy syndromes since the duration of epilepsy is longer and seizures can be frequent.
