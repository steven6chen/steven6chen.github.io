In the United States, the proportion of all outpatient surgeries performed outside a hospital setting has increased from 10 to 55 percent since the 1980s, and at least 17 percent of these are performed in physician offices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-based-anesthesia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In part, this shift is due to newer surgical and anesthetic techniques that have allowed more invasive procedures to be safely performed in non-hospital settings.</p><p>This topic will review advantages and disadvantages, patient and procedure selection, and anesthetic and postoperative management for office-based surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1016691395\"><span class=\"h1\">ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Advantages</strong> &ndash; The major advantages of office-based anesthesia for surgical procedures are patient and surgeon convenience and cost containment compared with hospital settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-based-anesthesia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Patients perceive greater personal attention and privacy. Surgeons perceive greater ease of scheduling, consistency in nursing personnel, efficiency, and reduced costs. Also, some data suggest that nosocomial infection rates are lower in office-based settings compared with hospital settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-based-anesthesia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Disadvantages</strong> &ndash; The major disadvantages of office-based anesthesia are safety concerns regarding the facility&rsquo;s resources and anesthetic techniques used in this setting, as well as less regulation of office settings compared with hospitals and other ambulatory surgery facilities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Safety: Office facility resources </strong>&ndash; More invasive and time-consuming surgical procedures are now offered to patients in an office-based setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-based-anesthesia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, private physician offices may be less safe than other surgical care settings due to fewer resources (eg, personnel, equipment, and access to specialists in other disciplines), which may be critically important when procedural or anesthetic complications occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-based-anesthesia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In some instances, the demand for office-based procedures by patients with challenging comorbidities (eg, obesity) may exceed the qualifications of the office-based surgical team. Ideally, these procedures should be performed in an accredited facility (eg, the Association for Accreditation of Ambulatory Surgical Facilities) by board-certified surgeons who are credentialed for the same procedures at a local hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-based-anesthesia/abstract/4-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Although there are no randomized prospective trials, two literature reviews of adverse outcomes and mortality after office-based surgical procedures concluded that office-based surgery is safe and cost-effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-based-anesthesia/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Adverse incidents occurred in 0.05 percent and deaths in 0.0017 percent of office-based surgeries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-based-anesthesia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Several other studies support the safety of office-based surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-based-anesthesia/abstract/5-9,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9,12,13</a>]. However, in a study of cases in Florida between 2000 and 2002 that compared adverse event rates in offices with those in ambulatory surgery centers, the risk of adverse incidents and death was approximately 10-fold higher in office-based settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-based-anesthesia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].<sup> </sup>This difference may be due to methodologic limitations in the study, particularly the way the adverse event rate was calculated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Safety: Anesthetic techniques </strong>&ndash; Another safety consideration is whether any particular anesthetic technique (eg, deep sedation or general anesthesia) is less safe in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-based-anesthesia/abstract/6,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,14</a>]. Most studies support the safety of general anesthesia as well as other techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-based-anesthesia/abstract/9,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12,13</a>]. In a large study (n = 23,000) of plastic surgical procedures performed under general anesthesia in an office-based setting, there were no deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-based-anesthesia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The largest prospective study of patients enrolled in an evaluation of anesthetic techniques in an office-based setting included 34,391 patients undergoing oral and maxillofacial surgery during a one-year period in 2001 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-based-anesthesia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In this study, 71.9 percent received deep <span class=\"nowrap\">sedation/general</span> anesthesia, 15.5 percent received conscious sedation, and the remainder received local anesthesia. There were no deaths and only two hospitalizations. The authors concluded that conscious sedation, deep sedation, general anesthesia, or local anesthesia were all safe options for oral and maxillofacial surgery in an office setting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Safety: Regulation </strong>&ndash; A third safety consideration is that office-based surgical facilities have little regulation in the United States, with no oversight or control at the federal level, unlike acute care hospitals and licensed ambulatory surgical facilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-based-anesthesia/abstract/3,4,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,15</a>]. State laws vary, and many lack regulations specific for office-based settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-based-anesthesia/abstract/2,3,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,14</a>]. The paucity of guidance and regulation implies additional responsibility for anesthesiologists practicing in office-based settings.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1016692191\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The selection of appropriate patients for office-based anesthesia is an important decision made by surgeons and anesthesiologists.</p><p>A review of the patient&rsquo;s medical records should include current medications, any drug or latex allergies, psychological history, family history (to assess presence of malignant hyperthermia), and evaluation for high-risk medical conditions (eg, morbid obesity, potentially difficult airway, or obstructive sleep apnea) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-based-anesthesia/abstract/3,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,16</a>] (see <a href=\"#H1034081760\" class=\"local\">'Poor candidates'</a> below). Use of a detailed screening questionnaire that the patient completes has been suggested to ensure a thorough risk assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-based-anesthesia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The anesthesiologist, in consultation with the patient&rsquo;s primary care physician <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> specialist(s), determines whether medical conditions (eg, asthma, diabetes, hypertension) have been optimally managed prior to scheduling the procedure.

The surgeon and anesthesiologist must determine whether the patient will be able to recover from the procedure and be discharged within a reasonable timeframe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-based-anesthesia/abstract/3,11,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,11,14</a>].</p><p>The likely duration and complexity of the procedure are considered. As newer surgical and anesthetic techniques have been developed, longer and more complicated procedures have been performed in an office-based setting. However, duration has been correlated with a higher incidence of unplanned hospital admission as well as increased incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, pain, and bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-based-anesthesia/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. The American Society of Plastic Surgery has recommended that procedures be limited to six hours, and be completed by 3:00 PM as long as the office remains fully staffed to meet the patient recovery needs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-based-anesthesia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Other procedure-related considerations include the type of anesthesia that will be required, expected blood loss, and likelihood of need for postoperative opioids. Some surgical procedures are not appropriate for the office setting, including those associated with blood loss that may require transfusion, major fluid shifts, or moderate to severe postoperative pain. Other considerations include the capabilities of the facility and the adequacy of postdischarge observation at the patient&rsquo;s home. (See <a href=\"#H1379685802\" class=\"local\">'Recovery and discharge'</a> below and <a href=\"#H377582919\" class=\"local\">'Regional anesthetic techniques'</a> below.)</p><p>Examples of procedures that are often performed in the office include gastrointestinal endoscopy, liposuction, aesthetic facial and breast surgery, oral and maxillofacial surgery, orthopedic surgery (including podiatry procedures), gynecologic and genitourinary surgery, and ophthalmologic and otolaryngology procedures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H703642258\"><span class=\"h1\">REQUIREMENTS FOR OFFICE ANESTHESIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Careful inspections of all anesthesia and emergency equipment are necessary prerequisites to providing anesthesia care (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F99792\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99792 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-based-anesthesia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Examination of the anesthesia work area should be performed to ensure that space requirements are met.

Either general anesthesia or moderate-to-deep sedation may be used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F99795\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99795 \">table 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-based-anesthesia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. This tumescent technique uses large volumes (eg, 1 to 4 mL for each 1 mL of fat to be removed) of an infiltrate solution such as 0.9% saline or Ringer&rsquo;s lactate with epinephrine 1:1,000,000 and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> 0.025% to 0.12%. </p><p>Since the large injectate volumes that are employed may result in hypervolemia, close attention to fluid and electrolyte balance is particularly important in the intraoperative and postoperative periods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-based-anesthesia/abstract/3,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,14</a>]. Patients are also at risk for hypothermia because the injectate fluids are not typically warmed. Active warming devices (eg, forced air warmers) are used in many plastic surgery offices to avoid and treat hypothermia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-based-anesthesia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. We agree with the guidelines of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons stating that the total volume of aspirant, including supernatant fat and fluid, should be limited to 5000 mL if the liposuction procedure is performed in isolation, or 2000 mL if performed with a concurrent aesthetic surgical procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-based-anesthesia/abstract/3,11,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,11,22</a>]. Body mass index is taken into account; the volume of aspirate removed should be proportional to the patient&rsquo;s overall size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-based-anesthesia/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Generally, aspirate volumes &gt;5000 mL are performed in an acute-care hospital or licensed <span class=\"nowrap\">/accredited</span> facility due to increased risk of complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-based-anesthesia/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. </p><p>The dose of epinephrine in the infiltrate solution used for the tumescent technique should not exceed 0.07 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (eg, &lt;5 mg in a 70 kg patient) in order to minimize risk for cardiovascular effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-based-anesthesia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Although epinephrine is rapidly metabolized with a half-life of about two minutes, sustained peak levels have been demonstrated during and after tumescent liposuction, possibly due to local vasoconstriction that results in delayed or reduced systemic absorption. One small study in five patients undergoing tumescent liposuction noted epinephrine peak blood concentrations ranging from 5.8 to 9.7 mg (0.08 to 0.12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> one to four hours after injection, with return to baseline levels after approximately 20 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-based-anesthesia/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. The total amount of absorbed epinephrine that was estimated for each patient ranged from 1.8 to 2.2 mg (equivalent to 25 to 32 percent of the infiltrated dose). Although none of the participants in this study exhibited any signs of toxicity after exposure to these high epinephrine doses, timing for presentation of catecholamine toxicity is unpredictable since drug absorption is variable. Severe reactions have been reported during or after subcutaneous epinephrine doses as low as 3 mg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-based-anesthesia/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. </p><p>Also, the dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> in the infiltrate solution used for the tumescent technique is typically 35 to 55 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> which is considerably higher than the 4.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> maximum recommended dose for regional anesthetic techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-based-anesthesia/abstract/53-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-55</a>]. These high doses are usually well-tolerated because the tumescent technique results in single compartment clearance, similar to that of a sustained-release medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-based-anesthesia/abstract/53,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,56</a>]. However, absorption of local anesthetic from the subcutaneous tissue is variable; thus, timing for onset of symptoms of lidocaine toxicity is unpredictable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-based-anesthesia/abstract/55,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,57</a>]. Although blood lidocaine levels typically peak 12 to 16 hours after initial injection of infiltrate solution, peaks may occur within two hours of injection, particularly if tumescent lidocaine without epinephrine is used (eg, for endovenous laser therapy). Thus, close postoperative monitoring in the office-based recovery area is necessary, and lipid emulsion should be immediately available for prompt treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F107887\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107887 \">table 9</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/office-based-anesthesia/abstract/14,55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,55,56</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1016692191\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Procedures that are generally inappropriate for office-based surgery include those associated with a prolonged duration (more than six hours), significant blood loss or fluid shifts, or moderate to severe postoperative pain. (See <a href=\"#H1016692173\" class=\"local\">'Procedure selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We use standard American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) monitoring in all office-based procedures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F110080\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110080 \">table 5</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2623106100\" class=\"local\">'Standard monitors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We use routine and crisis checklists to further ensure patient safety. (See <a href=\"#H703641895\" class=\"local\">'Checklists'</a> above and <a href=\"#H703642092\" class=\"local\">'Crisis checklists (emergency manuals)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sedation with monitored anesthesia care (MAC), deep sedation, general anesthesia, and regional anesthesia are each suitable anesthetic techniques in appropriate office-based surgical procedures. (See <a href=\"#H1108389987\" class=\"local\">'Anesthetic techniques'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To facilitate a rapid discharge after the procedure, only short-acting agents are used to produce either sedation or general anesthesia. Similarly, short-acting opioid agents are used to control pain. (See <a href=\"#H1108389012\" class=\"local\">'Selection of anesthetic agents: Goals'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1108389969\" class=\"local\">'Short duration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We use a multimodal approach to avoid <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> treat postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), including multiple drugs targeting different receptors, alternate anesthetic techniques (eg, total intravenous anesthesia with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>, regional anesthesia), adequate hydration, and nonopioid analgesics, particularly in patients at high risk for PONV. (See <a href=\"#H1108389012\" class=\"local\">'Selection of anesthetic agents: Goals'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1108389999\" class=\"local\">'Avoidance of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We use a multimodal approach to postoperative pain management, including combinations of drugs (eg, nonopioid analgesics with an opioid analgesic if necessary) and techniques (eg, long-acting local anesthetics). (See <a href=\"#H1108390223\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative pain control'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Safe recovery and discharge depend on the office-based staff&rsquo;s ability to deliver appropriate intensity and duration of postoperative monitoring. Complications such as respiratory events, delayed emergence from anesthesia, pain, nausea or vomiting, urinary retention, and hypothermia must be recognized and treated. Standard discharge criteria are used to supplement the assessment of the responsible anesthesiologist for release home.
