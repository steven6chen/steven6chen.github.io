Two factors are required for the genesis and then maintenance of metabolic alkalosis: a process that raises the plasma bicarbonate concentration and a process that prevents excretion of the excess bicarbonate in the urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Treatment of metabolic alkalosis should be aimed at reversing these two factors.</p><p>This topic will provide a brief overview of the pathogenesis of metabolic alkalosis followed by a discussion of how to treat affected patients. The pathogenesis of metabolic alkalosis is reviewed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-metabolic-alkalosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of metabolic alkalosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The etiology and evaluation of patients with metabolic alkalosis are discussed separately.

Initially, a process that raises the plasma bicarbonate concentration occurs, and then another process prevents excretion of the excess bicarbonate in the urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9319111\"><span class=\"h2\">Factors that increase plasma bicarbonate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several mechanisms can increase the plasma bicarbonate concentration. They include (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F57489\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57489 \">table 1</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-metabolic-alkalosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of metabolic alkalosis&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hydrogen loss from the body due to removal of gastric secretions (as with vomiting or tube drainage), loss in the stool when gastrointestinal bicarbonate and chloride transport is abnormal (chloride wasting diarrhea), or excessive urinary acid secretion (due, for example, to loop or thiazide diuretics or primary mineralocorticoid excess).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shift of hydrogen ions from the extracellular fluid (ECF) into the cells.

This number increases if the serum HCO3 concentration is elevated. Thus, a high serum bicarbonate concentration could be readily corrected by excretion of the excess bicarbonate into the urine. However, such correction will not occur if kidney filtration is markedly reduced or the renal tubules avidly reabsorb the filtered bicarbonate. The importance of reduced bicarbonate excretion for maintenance of metabolic alkalosis was illustrated in a study of adults who had a gastric or duodenal ulcer and were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> at a dose ranging from 8 to 24 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/kg</span> per day (approximately 500 to 1500 mEq per day) for two to three weeks. These large doses of sodium bicarbonate produced only small elevations in the plasma bicarbonate concentration of approximately 3 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> because nearly all of the ingested bicarbonate was excreted in the urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A major rise in serum bicarbonate requires a major reduction in renal bicarbonate excretion.</p><p>The most common cause of impaired bicarbonate excretion in patients with metabolic alkalosis is a reduction in arterial blood volume or in the effective arterial blood volume (EABV), also called effective circulating volume. EABV is a difficult-to-measure entity that refers to the arterial volume that perfuses the tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A reduction in EABV stimulates the kidney to retain sodium salts and, because bicarbonate must be excreted with sodium or potassium to maintain electroneutrality, this sodium avidity limits the excretion of bicarbonate. The net effect is that renal bicarbonate excretion is largely eliminated by the presence of a reduced arterial blood volume or volume-reduced EABV. Under these circumstances, patients may excrete a &quot;paradoxically&quot; acid urine (paradoxical aciduria) despite the presence of metabolic alkalosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>].</p><p>The most common causes of a true volume depletion associated with metabolic alkalosis are vomiting or diuretic therapy. The most common causes of reduced EABV are heart failure and cirrhosis.</p><p>Hypokalemia can also reduce renal bicarbonate excretion because it stimulates renal ammoniagenesis and ammonium excretion (ammonium excreted with chloride generates more bicarbonate, while ammonium excreted with bicarbonate has no net acid-base impact).</p><p>In addition, acute and chronic kidney disease reduces the capacity to excrete bicarbonate. Thus, bicarbonate administration or generation in such patients will generate a persistent metabolic alkalosis. However, metabolic acidosis is much more common in patients with reduced kidney function as a result of an inability to excrete the normal daily dietary acid load.</p><p>Virtually all clinical situations associated with true arterial volume contraction, or a reduced EABV, generate avid renal chloride reabsorption. Reduced renal chloride delivery markedly impairs the kidney's capacity to excrete bicarbonate and thereby prevent the development, or correct the presence, of metabolic alkalosis. The mechanisms by which these changes occur are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-metabolic-alkalosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of metabolic alkalosis&quot;, section on 'Hypokalemia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-metabolic-alkalosis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of metabolic alkalosis&quot;, section on 'Chloride depletion'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-consequences-and-treatment-of-metabolic-acidosis-in-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, consequences, and treatment of metabolic acidosis in chronic kidney disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9857754\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of metabolic alkalosis should be aimed at the source of bicarbonate generation (or administration) and at reversing those factors that prevent the kidneys from excreting the excess bicarbonate. In order to accomplish this, two questions must be answered:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the increase in plasma bicarbonate concentration due to gastrointestinal or renal hydrogen ion loss (eg, vomiting, diuretic therapy), contraction of the extracellular fluid (ECF) volume, an intracellular shift of hydrogen ions, an exogenous load of alkali or alkali precursors, or a combination of these factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F57489\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57489 \">table 1</a>)?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Why is the excess bicarbonate not being excreted in the urine? As discussed above, the major causes of reduced renal bicarbonate excretion are reduced arterial blood volume or effective arterial blood volume (EABV; associated with chloride depletion or inadequate distal tubule chloride delivery), hypokalemia, and acute or chronic kidney disease. (See <a href=\"#H9319118\" class=\"local\">'Factors that impair bicarbonate excretion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1863594\"><span class=\"h2\">Treat the underlying cause</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The underlying etiology of the alkalosis should be addressed (eg, treat the cause of vomiting, stop or reduce the removal of gastric secretions, reduce the acid content of the gastrointestinal secretions, and, if possible, stop loop or thiazide diuretics). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-metabolic-alkalosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of metabolic alkalosis&quot;, section on 'Gastrointestinal hydrogen loss'</a>.)</p><p>Patients who develop metabolic alkalosis as a result of persistent vomiting or gastric suction can be effectively treated with drugs that reduce gastric hydrochloric acid (HCl) secretion. Both H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors have been utilized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>All exogenous sources of alkali should be discontinued to the extent possible. This includes sodium or potassium bicarbonate and sodium or potassium salts of any organic anion that is metabolized to bicarbonate, such as citrate or lactate. Bicarbonate administered to patients with organic metabolic acidosis (usually lactic or ketoacidosis) can also be considered &quot;excess&quot; bicarbonate (to the extent that the organic anion has been retained in body fluids) and can result in a &quot;rebound&quot; or post-correction metabolic alkalosis. This occurs because, after correction of the hypotension or insulin deficiency, metabolism of the lactate or beta-hydroxybutyrate regenerates bicarbonate. Thus, the exogenously administered <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> will then represent &quot;excess&quot; bicarbonate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bicarbonate-therapy-in-lactic-acidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bicarbonate therapy in lactic acidosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-ketoacidosis-and-hyperosmolar-hyperglycemic-state-in-adults-treatment#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state in adults: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Bicarbonate and metabolic acidosis'</a>.)</p><p>Hypokalemia commonly occurs in these patients and, if present, should be reversed.

If the arterial volume depletion can be treated and reversed with isotonic saline (sodium chloride), this will simultaneously restore arterial volume, correct the chloride deficit, and increase renal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> excretion.</p><p>All forms of reduced arterial blood volume and EABV promote persistence of metabolic alkalosis since the kidney is stimulated to retain sodium, and this limits the ability to excrete bicarbonate. Causes of true volume depletion include vomiting, nasogastric suction, diuretic therapy, marked sweat loss (especially with a high sweat salt concentration as in cystic fibrosis), blood loss, loss of fluid into the &quot;third&quot; space, and, rarely, villous adenoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F57489\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57489 \">table 1</a>). Causes of EABV depletion include heart failure and cirrhosis. These causes of low EABV do not respond to saline volume expansion, and such treatment can result in clinical deterioration.

Usually, this is accomplished with isotonic saline, which expands the extracellular fluid (ECF) and intravascular compartment. A reasonable regimen in patients with mild-to-moderate hypovolemia is to administer isotonic saline at a rate that is about 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> greater than the sum of urine output plus other fluid losses that may be present (eg, gastrointestinal losses). More aggressive therapy is required in patients with severe hypovolemia.

This is often due to diuretic therapy. Treatment with isotonic saline is generally <strong>contraindicated</strong> in edematous patients for two reasons: It will increase edema, ascites, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> effusions, and it will <strong>not</strong> correct the metabolic alkalosis since the underlying renal sodium avidity will persist, limiting urinary excretion of the excess bicarbonate. These patients are usually hypokalemic and potassium depleted. In such patients, the metabolic alkalosis is often improved or even corrected by administering <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium chloride</a>. The addition of potassium-sparing diuretics such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiloride</a> may also be helpful.

Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that primarily inhibits proximal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> reabsorption, thereby increasing urinary bicarbonate excretion.

The resulting kaliuresis can cause or worsen hypokalemia. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Potassium chloride</a> replacement may be necessary. Contraindications to acetazolamide therapy include hypersensitivity to sulfonamides, severe liver disease, hypokalemia (as noted), and severe kidney disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1864673\"><span class=\"h4\">Chloride depletion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As mentioned above, sodium and potassium should be given with chloride to correct metabolic alkalosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/7,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11</a>]. Volume expansion with chloride salts reduces proximal tubule bicarbonate reabsorption and increases the distal tubule delivery of sodium and chloride where the chloride is reabsorbed in exchange for bicarbonate in the connecting segment and collecting tubules by a luminal <span class=\"nowrap\">chloride/bicarbonate</span> exchanger called pendrin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F62465\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62465 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Whether resolution of hypovolemia or repletion of the chloride deficit is the key factor responsible for correcting metabolic alkalosis in response to saline infusion is the subject of ongoing debate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Some experimental models support the principal role of chloride depletion. As an example, administration of chloride with a non-sodium cation (such as choline chloride) can correct some experimental forms of metabolic alkalosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] but administration of sodium salts with a non-chloride anion (such as sulfate or nitrate) does not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/2,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13</a>]. However, anions such as sulfate and nitrate are freely filtered and delivered to the distal renal tubules, where they cannot be readily reabsorbed. Under those conditions, reabsorption of sodium without an accompanying anion causes the anion to be excreted with ammonium (NH4), titratable acid (H2PO4), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> potassium, preventing correction of the metabolic alkalosis and further depleting potassium stores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/1,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9857783\"><span class=\"h3\">Potassium depletion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium chloride</a> is an important component of the treatment of metabolic alkalosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/1,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14</a>].</p><p>Potassium depletion with hypokalemia enhances proximal tubule bicarbonate reabsorption and also activates a collecting tubule H-K-ATPase that reabsorbs potassium in exchange for secreted hydrogen.

The movement of administered potassium into cells occurs, in part, in exchange for intracellular hydrogen ions to maintain electroneutrality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The movement of hydrogen ions out of cells and the repletion of intracellular potassium have several important effects, each of which will lower the plasma bicarbonate concentration:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The hydrogen ions entering the ECF buffer extracellular bicarbonate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In renal tubular cells, the reduction in intracellular hydrogen concentration raises the intracellular pH.

Although several studies reported that acetazolamide improved the respiratory acidosis, as manifested by a fall in arterial PCO2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>], one study that compared treated patients with historical controls found <strong>no</strong> improvement in arterial PCO2 and no accelerated weaning from the respirator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Red blood cell carbonic anhydrase plays a role in the transport of CO2 from red blood cells to the alveolar space. Thus, inhibition of this enzyme with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetazolamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetazolamide</a> can cause a small and transient rise in the arterial PCO2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/17,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,21</a>]. This effect is not clinically significant in most patients.</p><p>Other forms of metabolic alkalosis can also complicate chronic respiratory acidosis (gastric aspiration, glucocorticoid treatment, aggressive diuresis, etc), and correction of this superimposed derangement can improve respiratory status, as reflected in lower PCO2 levels and improved oxygen exchange in critically ill patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9857825\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of metabolic alkalosis with acute or chronic kidney disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Metabolic alkalosis can develop in patients with acute or chronic kidney disease in whom therapies aimed at increasing urinary bicarbonate excretion are less likely to be effective (unless their kidney dysfunction is largely due to reversible ECF volume depletion). In some cases, dialysis will be indicated. Dialysis with a low-bicarbonate bath concentration will rapidly improve the alkalosis. However, it may be difficult to markedly reduce bicarbonate bath concentrations. Because the patient's bicarbonate in such cases is usually higher than a standard dialysis bicarbonate bath concentration, routine dialysis should improve the metabolic alkalosis, albeit less effectively than dialysis with a low-bicarbonate bath [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p>Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) can be used to correct metabolic alkalosis in patients requiring renal replacement therapy. When high rates of ultrafiltration are used, the composition of the replacement fluid can markedly alter the electrolyte and acid-base status of the patient. If the replacement fluid contains relatively high concentrations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a>, or precursors of sodium bicarbonate such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-lactate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium lactate</a> or sodium citrate (potential bicarbonate), then the bicarbonate concentration of the patient can be rapidly increased. Conversely, adjusting the replacement fluid to reduce the concentration of sodium bicarbonate, and potential bicarbonate salts, can rapidly reduce the patient's bicarbonate concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-metabolic-alkalosis/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].

It does <strong>not</strong> take into account continuing acid losses (as with nasogastric suction), changes in volume status, changes in bicarbonate distribution space related to the bicarbonate concentration, potassium balance, or renal function. If acid infusion is prescribed, the goal should be partial correction of the alkalosis with intermittent reassessment. Thus, in these rare instances in which acid therapy is used, we recommend that only one liter of solution (containing 100 mEq of HCl or NH4Cl) be infused. Then, serum chemistries should be remeasured, and the clinical status should be reassessed to determine whether or not additional acid therapy is required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3016554255\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

(See <a href=\"#H1039092\" class=\"local\">'Overview of the pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common causes of impaired renal bicarbonate excretion in patients with metabolic alkalosis are a reduction in the effective arterial blood volume (EABV; also called effective circulating volume), chloride depletion, hypokalemia, and acute and chronic kidney disease. (See <a href=\"#H9319118\" class=\"local\">'Factors that impair bicarbonate excretion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of metabolic alkalosis should be aimed at reversing the etiology of bicarbonate generation and reversing the factors that prevent the excretion of the excess bicarbonate. In order to accomplish this, two questions must be answered (see <a href=\"#H9857754\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Is the increase in plasma bicarbonate concentration due to an exogenous alkali load, gastrointestinal or renal hydrogen ion loss (eg, vomiting, diuretic therapy) with or without contraction alkalosis, an intracellular shift of hydrogen ions, or a combination of these disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F57489\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57489 \">table 1</a>)?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Why is the excess bicarbonate not being excreted in the urine?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The underlying etiology of the alkalosis should be reversed (eg, treating the cause of vomiting, stopping or slowing the removal of gastric secretions and reducing the acidity of these secretions, and stopping loop or thiazide diuretics). Any exogenous sources of alkali should be discontinued. Hypokalemia, which is often present, should be corrected. (See <a href=\"#H1863594\" class=\"local\">'Treat the underlying cause'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintenance of metabolic alkalosis is due to a reduction in the renal excretion of the excess bicarbonate. The reversal of metabolic alkalosis requires the renal excretion of bicarbonate whenever possible. (See <a href=\"#H1863671\" class=\"local\">'Increase renal bicarbonate excretion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced EABV and chloride depletion usually occur together, and the treatment of EABV depletion with isotonic saline (sodium chloride) simultaneously corrects the volume and chloride deficits. This generally increases renal bicarbonate excretion in patients with true volume depletion. However, isotonic saline is not indicated when the EABV depletion is caused by conditions such as heart failure or cirrhosis. (See <a href=\"#H1863706\" class=\"local\">'Reduced arterial or effective arterial blood volume and chloride depletion'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1864356\" class=\"local\">'True volume depletion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When metabolic alkalosis develops in patients with reduced EABV due to conditions such as heart failure or cirrhosis, treatment includes the administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium chloride</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a potassium-sparing diuretic or, uncommonly, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetazolamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetazolamide</a> if further diuresis is required.

The administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium chloride</a> corrects both the potassium deficit and helps reverse the metabolic alkalosis. (See <a href=\"#H9857783\" class=\"local\">'Potassium depletion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic respiratory acidosis, which is most often due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, is initially associated with increased renal acid excretion and, later, with increased bicarbonate reabsorption. This produces a compensatory increase in the serum bicarbonate concentration that mitigates the fall in arterial pH (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F63315\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63315 \">figure 2</a>). If the chronic respiratory acidosis improves as a result of mechanical ventilation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> medical intervention, a posthypercapnic metabolic alkalosis may develop. Many patients with posthypercapnic metabolic alkalosis can be effectively treated with isotonic saline infusion, which corrects EABV and chloride deficits. Another option for the treatment of posthypercapnic metabolic alkalosis is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetazolamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetazolamide</a>, which increases urinary bicarbonate excretion.

One example is metabolic alkalosis developing in patients with advanced acute or chronic kidney disease. Such patients can often be treated with dialysis.
