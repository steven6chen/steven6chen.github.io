Patients aged 15 to 39 years old at their initial diagnosis constitute the adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivorship population, which includes approximately 70,000 patients diagnosed each year, or 2 percent of all invasive cancers diagnosed in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>] and less than 10 percent of all cancer survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Although the incidence of invasive cancer in AYAs is lower than in younger children or older adults, the psychosocial needs of AYAs often exceed those seen in older adults.</p><p>This section reviews the evidence related to psychosocial issues in AYA cancer survivors, including prevalence, risk factors, and interventions that address the psychosocial needs of AYA cancer survivors. For purposes of this discussion, we will address survivorship as it pertains to AYA patients who have completed initial treatment for cancer and who are without evidence of disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H451250759\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cancer in the adolescent and young adult (AYA) population crosses many diagnoses. The United States National Cancer Institute reported the most common types of cancer occurring between 1975 and 2000 using data derived from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program, and these included [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymphoma (21 percent), with Hodgkin lymphoma accounting for almost 12 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Melanoma (15 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cancer of the male genital system (11 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cancer involving the endocrine system (11 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cancer of the female genital tract (9 percent), predominantly consisting of cancers of the cervix and ovary</p><p/><p>Other less common cancers included those involving the brain and spinal cord (6 percent), leukemias (6 percent), breast cancer (5 percent), malignancies of the digestive tract (4 percent), soft tissue sarcomas (3 percent), bone sarcoma (3 percent), and cancers of the oral <span class=\"nowrap\">cavity/pharynx,</span> urinary tract, and respiratory system (each 2 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H609475115\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For numerous reasons, both biological and psychosocial, the needs of adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors appear to be distinct from both older adult and pediatric survivors: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Survival rates for AYAs have not improved to the extent that they have for younger children or older adult cancer populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Some data suggest that the poorer outcomes in AYAs (particularly those with colon or breast cancer) are in part related to their biology, including different genomic risks, tumor histopathology, oncogenic pathway deregulation, and chemotherapy sensitivities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. In addition, there appears to be a tendency for AYA patients to be diagnosed at later stages compared with older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AYAs with cancer appear to have different side effect profiles to chemotherapy and other cancer-related treatments. For example, younger colon cancer patients reported more nausea and vomiting than older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AYAs have been underrepresented in clinical trials, particularly when compared with pediatric populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. </p><p/><p>More research and clinical trials need to be done with AYAs to better understand their cancer biology and to optimize treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, beyond these biologic differences, psychosocial issues are primary concerns for AYA cancer survivors post-treatment and require attention from providers, as reinforced by a recent Institute of Medicine report and multiple population-based surveys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H609475184\"><span class=\"h2\">Rationale for a focus on AYA cancer survivors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An emphasis on the issues faced by AYAs with cancer has evolved in large measure because of the developmental issues that may affect AYAs differently than children or older adults such as their emphasis on education attainment, career development, and fertility issues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/20-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-26</a>]. Based on qualitative interviews and a systematic review, AYAs were found to have needs in three areas: social well-being, information, and health care services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Since AYAs do not necessarily fit in either pediatric or adult oncology settings, some have advocated for a dedicated AYA oncology service to better target their needs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p>As AYA cancer survivors age into mature adulthood, they may have deficits in quality of life compared with age-matched controls without a history of cancer. Therefore, it is important to assess and treat symptoms and quality of life deficits before they become chronic, since AYAs will spend the majority of their lives with these consequences of diagnosis and treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. </p><p>In large measure, what we know about needs of 15 to 39 year old cancer survivors derives not from those diagnosed as AYAs, but from childhood cancer survivors who have aged into being AYAs. The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) is the largest cohort of childhood and adolescent cancer survivors in North America, with 25 participating institutions and 14,054 survivors diagnosed under the age of 21, a majority of whom have been assessed as AYAs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The CCSS has found that poor mental health is reported by 30 percent of those who are on average over 20 years after a diagnosis of cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. This is consistent with other research demonstrating poorer emotional well-being in survivors diagnosed as AYAs compared with age-matched controls or other survivor populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], and 41 percent of AYAs report an unmet need for counseling 12 months after diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. For AYAs who were a median of 11 months after diagnosis, two-thirds reported moderate to high levels of unmet informational needs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. These findings indicate the importance of understanding AYA psychosocial needs and determining strategies to meet those needs.

For example, one study that utilized data from the 2009 United States population-based Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), which included 4054 AYA cancer survivors and 345,592 respondents without a history of cancer (controls), reported that AYA cancer survivors reported a higher prevalence of [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoking compared with controls (26 versus 18 percent, respectively)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obesity (31 versus 27 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic health conditions (14 versus 7 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poorer mental health (20 versus 10 percent) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poorer physical health (24 versus 10 percent) </p><p/><p>A study using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health found similar findings for daily smoking in AYAs (34 percent) versus healthy matched controls (20 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Using data from the National Health Interview Surveys, 33 percent of the AYAs were current smokers compared with 22 percent in the comparison group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Using The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System data, female AYAs (27 percent) smoked more than controls (14 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Ethnicity could be a protective factor as Latino AYAs were less likely to be lifetime smokers than non-Hispanic whites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. AYAs also report more fatigue than controls (odds ratio [OR] 2.47) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Their health-related quality of life is worse than those without a cancer history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>] as is their social functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. AYAs also report more moderate (23 versus 16 percent) and severe (8 versus 3 percent) emotional distress than controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Compared with age-matched peers, AYAs report more financial problems indicating financial toxicity is a concern for this group too [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>These disparate outcomes in the young adult (YA) population are likely related to multiple factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Barriers to care &ndash; These include lack of health insurance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>], which may change due to a provision in the Affordable Care Act that allows children through the age of 26 to be on their parents&rsquo; health insurance, but does not cover the full age spectrum of AYAs. There is some indication that those in the older ages (25 to 39 years old) are more likely to be without insurance than younger AYAs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. <br/><br/>Access to health care insurance could be an important factor, as those without health insurance report worse psychosocial outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Latino AYAs are less likely to be insured than white AYAs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Knowledge barriers &ndash; AYAs appear to lack adequate information about cancer treatments they received, cancer recurrence or second cancer risks, and the other survivorship follow-up they need based on the type of cancer and treatments they had [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. This may be made even more complicated by a lack of perception that they need subsequent health care, as well as avoidance behaviors with regard to subsequent care. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Competing priorities &ndash; For AYA cancer survivors, competing priorities may be a barrier to better care. These include the need to balance non-health priorities such as career, home and family, and limited practical and economic resources [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/36,53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,53,54</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychosocial outcomes &ndash; The challenges, transitions, choices, and developmental milestones related to education, employment, identity, relationships, and family concerns of AYAs differ from older adults who may be retired or have had the children that they wish to have. In qualitative interviews with adolescent cancer survivors, they report feeling isolated and different from their peers who have not had cancer and consequently can withdraw from their peers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>], while other barriers to care may block their seeking of resources to meet their psychosocial needs. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical scars and body changes &ndash; Some AYA survivors may be challenged by physical deformities, particularly during this phase of life when body image is critical to their sense of self. In interviews with AYA survivors, they reported thinning hair, scars, and stretch marks as negatively affecting their body image [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. In addition, data from the CCSS show that 67 percent of AYAs who survived a childhood cancer reported some kind of disfigurement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Female AYAs are more at risk for negative body image than males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Learning and communication styles &ndash; AYAs have distinctive types of learning and communication needs that differ from those of younger or older survivors of cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>]. These may influence their responsiveness to health education and recommended health care. For example, online groups may be a way to disseminate information to this group of survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Video, text messaging, and use of social media may be other avenues for connecting that resonate with this population; language choice also needs to be age appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/17,61-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,61-63</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1576238272\"><span class=\"h1\">PSYCHIATRIC AND PSYCHOSOCIAL NEEDS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12956132\"><span class=\"h2\">Cancer-related distress</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cancer-related distress includes the consequences of living with heightened awareness of the uncertainties in life and is common in survivors. This distress has components of worry about recurrence, hypervigilance about symptoms, concerns about family and finances, and the stress of managing health needs, as well as changes in self-perceptions, body image, and feelings of vulnerability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. It may also include levels of discomfort that do not meet full clinical criteria for anxiety or depressive disorders, and often includes somatic symptoms at rates above those in the general population, such as difficulty with concentration, fatigue, and sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/50,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,65</a>].</p><p>Within the first four months after a diagnosis, 12 percent of adolescent and young adult (AYA) survivors report distress, which persists at 6 and 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/33,66-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,66-68</a>].

For survivors who have received alkylating agents or radiotherapy, treatment can lead to genital tissue changes and hormone deficiencies that include not only estrogen or testosterone, but also hypothalamic and pituitary hormones. These changes affect sexual function as well as energy and sexual desire.</p><p>When compared with age-matched controls or older survivors, AYAs consistently report poorer sexual function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/74,108\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,108</a>]. At a time of life when many young adults (YAs) feel vulnerable about their body image, cancer can exacerbate this self-consciousness, with as much as 60 percent of AYA survivors reporting a negative body image, which may in turn impact sexual function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The age and sex of the survivor are important factors to consider, even within subgroups of AYA survivors.

Furthermore, it is important to reassess these concerns as AYAs transition from the end of active treatment to survivorship, and over time as priorities change [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>]. Adolescents and young adults (AYAs) may feel awkward and distressed by a need to discuss infertility, premature menopause, and sexual function adaptations such as lubricants with their partners many years before these issues would normally arise.

Despite this, one study of young breast cancer survivors reported that only 34 percent reported having this kind of a discussion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/128\" class=\"abstract_t\">128</a>], although other studies report a more encouraging rate of engagement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>].

Therefore, health care teams need to establish standard procedures for discussing these options with AYAs and their parents or partners so that referrals can be made that will give AYAs a chance to start families once they are ready [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/140,141\" class=\"abstract_t\">140,141</a>].

Examples of findings in the literature include that:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AYAs report feeling closer to their family at the end of treatment and indicate that their family is a major source of emotional support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/153\" class=\"abstract_t\">153</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Younger caregivers report more distress than older caregivers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/154\" class=\"abstract_t\">154</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mothers often accompany their AYA survivors to their follow-up visits well past the age that most young adults (YAs) would be independently managing their own health care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/155\" class=\"abstract_t\">155</a>]. Among Latinos, AYA survivors appear to more commonly welcome the involvement of their mother in subsequent care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/156\" class=\"abstract_t\">156</a>]. This may be important, as there is some indication that Latino AYAs may suffer worse psychosocial outcomes, and inclusion of the family may help prevent negative outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. </p><p/><p>Researchers have begun to measure development with AYA caregivers to assess their needs, and thus far many focus on obtaining information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/157\" class=\"abstract_t\">157</a>]. One measure for mothers of AYA survivors found that four factors emerged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/158\" class=\"abstract_t\">158</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Social competence</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Health perceptions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Satisfaction with health care</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Health apprehension </p><p/><p>Measures for siblings and grandparents of AYAs have also been devised to measure their psychosocial needs, but have not yet been widely tested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/159,160\" class=\"abstract_t\">159,160</a>]. </p><p>It may be useful to measure the effects of survivorship on AYAs and their caregivers' family functioning. In a study of AYAs and their caregivers, each person's depressive symptoms impacted family functioning, whereas only the caregiver's depressive symptoms were related to family cohesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/161\" class=\"abstract_t\">161</a>]. Parents and AYAs report similar levels of posttraumatic growth, and for AYAs who used more active coping, their parents reported feeling less distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/162\" class=\"abstract_t\">162</a>].</p><p>Little is known about the economic costs to AYAs and their caregivers during survivorship. Parents of AYAs often have to bear a significant economic burden, as they may have to stop working in addition to paying the uninsured costs of cancer care over the course of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/163\" class=\"abstract_t\">163</a>]. This study may underestimate the economic costs, as they used only administrative data and did not ask the families directly about other costs that may be significant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12956328\"><span class=\"h1\">INTERVENTIONS FOR PSYCHOSOCIAL ISSUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interventions have been developed to assist cancer survivors with many of the psychosocial issues they face, but most have been tested during the early diagnostic or treatment phases of care and have not been developed specifically for adolescents and young adults (AYAs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/164\" class=\"abstract_t\">164</a>]. In a systematic review of psychological interventions for AYAs, only two specifically recruited participants diagnosed as young adults rather than those diagnosed in childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/165\" class=\"abstract_t\">165</a>]. Among AYAs, those in late adolescence are the least studied, so clearly, more work is needed to design interventions for those between ages 15 and 19 years and to enroll young adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/166\" class=\"abstract_t\">166</a>]. </p><p>Among the few randomized controlled trials focused on AYAs, a Facebook-based physical activity intervention was effective in increasing activity levels in young adult survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/167\" class=\"abstract_t\">167</a>]. A pilot study of a mindfulness-based intervention was effective in reducing distress and improving quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/168\" class=\"abstract_t\">168</a>].</p><p>A fair amount is known about what interventions AYAs want. Primary among their interests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ability to meet other AYAs to be able to share their cancer experience with survivors in their similar age group, which appears to be of a higher priority than even support from family and friends [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/169\" class=\"abstract_t\">169</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Greater access to information on psychosocial resources [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/170\" class=\"abstract_t\">170</a>], which could include retreats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/171\" class=\"abstract_t\">171</a>], workshops [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/172\" class=\"abstract_t\">172</a>], cognitive behavioral therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/173\" class=\"abstract_t\">173</a>], psychosexual education [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/174\" class=\"abstract_t\">174</a>], and group-based cognitive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/175\" class=\"abstract_t\">175</a>]. Improving self-efficacy in self-management seems especially important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/176\" class=\"abstract_t\">176</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Online social networking, including social media and web-based interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/175,177-185\" class=\"abstract_t\">175,177-185</a>]. For example, a mobile app has also been developed for pain management in adolescents with cancer that could be used as a model for targeting psychosocial outcomes in survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/186,187\" class=\"abstract_t\">186,187</a>], but needs to be tested in randomized trials to prove efficacy. In addition, a web-based intervention for smoking cessation was developed for AYAs, and the quit rates were comparable to those who received print materials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/188\" class=\"abstract_t\">188</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H609475909\"><span class=\"h2\">Support groups</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Support groups may be helpful for adolescents, but have not been tested in randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/189\" class=\"abstract_t\">189</a>]. One pilot study evaluated a six-month rehabilitation program that included goal setting, physical activity, psycho-educational methods, and peer support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/190\" class=\"abstract_t\">190</a>]. While not randomized, it demonstrated that participants reported improvements in health-related quality of life. Despite its strengths, its applicability may be limited because the first part of the intervention required a three-week residential rehabilitation program. Online groups may be easier for AYAs to discuss more sensitive topics such as sexual function compared with face-to-face groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/191\" class=\"abstract_t\">191</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H609475915\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical activity-based interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exercise interventions demonstrate the strongest evidence for efficacy in improving outcomes. This is supported by a systematic review, though while not specific to AYA, included studies with AYA participants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/192\" class=\"abstract_t\">192</a>]. A review that focused on participants between the ages of 13 and 39 found that exercise interventions had better outcomes than health promotion interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/165\" class=\"abstract_t\">165</a>]. The modes of intervention varied widely from strength training to walking, cycling, yoga, Qigong, or Tai Chi, and the durability of the effects have not been well examined. However, the incorporation of exercise was beneficial in terms of:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overall quality of life</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Body image</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Self-esteem</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Emotional well-being</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sexuality</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Social functioning</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anxiety</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fatigue</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain</p><p/><p>Another approach with particular appeal to AYAs may be an outdoor adventure program, which has demonstrated beneficial effects in improving body image and decreasing depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/193\" class=\"abstract_t\">193</a>]. Clearly, further testing of activity-based, online methods, and group support interventions for AYAs is needed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-roles-of-diet-physical-activity-and-body-weight-in-cancer-survivorship\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The roles of diet, physical activity, and body weight in cancer survivorship&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1576238981\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO AYA CANCER SURVIVORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Screening of adolescent and young adult (AYA) survivors&rsquo; needs in the various psychosocial areas that have been discussed is an essential first step toward meeting their needs. Assessment is needed early after treatment and at least annually, as needs may change over time and with life stages. The process can be started by asking survivors how they are doing and what they are looking forward to. At this time, it is unclear what the best screening tools are for this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/194,195\" class=\"abstract_t\">194,195</a>], so it will require health care providers to ask about psychosocial symptoms. In addition, there is very little agreement between AYAs and their oncology providers' perceptions about these concerns, so it is imperative to be asking the survivors directly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/196\" class=\"abstract_t\">196</a>]. Communication is related to satisfaction with health care, so it is necessary to make space to discuss topics that are important to individual survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/197\" class=\"abstract_t\">197</a>]. However, clinical research is still needed to evaluate the best way to transition AYAs into survivorship, help them adjust to confident adult health care particularly if they began in pediatrics, and to make sure that their needs are met as they continue their lives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/198\" class=\"abstract_t\">198</a>]. </p><p>Appropriate referrals to psychosocial services can help AYA survivors cope with the myriad issues that may arise in survivorship, so that the issues do not become entrenched with the passage of time and thus be more difficult to treat. This is especially true in the area of sexual function, where early intervention may be key to recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>], and an early referral to a sexual health specialist could be crucial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/51,197,199-201\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,197,199-201</a>]. Finally, the promotion of healthy lifestyles and attention to screening and prevention efforts are essential for these patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-roles-of-diet-physical-activity-and-body-weight-in-cancer-survivorship\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The roles of diet, physical activity, and body weight in cancer survivorship&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cancer-survivorship-care-for-primary-care-and-oncology-providers#H11934000\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cancer survivorship care for primary care and oncology providers&quot;, section on 'Preventive care'</a>.)</p><p>Providing and discussing survivorship care plans can provide an opportunity to help AYAs bring up uncomfortable topics, find resources they need, and feel confident about their ability to manage survivorship [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Receiving a care plan is associated with lower unmet needs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/202\" class=\"abstract_t\">202</a>]. These care plans provide clear communication for survivorship in terms of what to potentially expect as these psychosocial issues can be a barrier for participating in adherence for their health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/203,204\" class=\"abstract_t\">203,204</a>]. In addition, ensuring care is coordinated across specialists and their primary care provider may help ensure compliance with these and other issues. Technology, such as texting, may improve survivorship behaviors by helping with scheduling appointments to monitor late effects and providing reminders for appointments or other planned behaviors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-survivorship-in-adolescent-and-young-adults/abstract/205\" class=\"abstract_t\">205</a>].

However, a substantial proportion of this population appear to have posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) and do not meet the clinical criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD.
