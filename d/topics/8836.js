It is distressing for the infant, the parents, and the clinician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-management-and-outcome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The parents of the infant may view the crying as an indictment of their caregiving ability or as evidence of illness in their child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-management-and-outcome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Colic is a benign, self-limited condition that resolves with time. However, the family's beliefs concerning the cause of crying and their interactions with the health care system related to the crying may affect the way in which they view the child and the health care system long after the crying has resolved.</p><p>The management of infantile colic is reviewed here. The clinical features, proposed etiologies, and diagnosis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infantile-colic-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infantile colic: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H620225416\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We broadly define colic as crying for no apparent reason (eg, hunger, soiled diaper, etc) that lasts for &ge;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">hours/day</span> and occurs on &ge;3 days per week in an otherwise healthy infant &lt;3 months of age. Stricter definitions include criteria for minimum duration (eg, three weeks) or associated clinical features. Other terms that are interchangeable with colic include &quot;cry-fuss behavior,&quot; &quot;excessive crying,&quot; &quot;unsettled infant behavior,&quot; and &quot;period of PURPLE crying&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-management-and-outcome/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].

In a systematic review and meta-analysis of 28 diary studies including 8690 infants, colic (defined as <span class=\"nowrap\">crying/fussing</span> &ge;3 hours per day on &ge;3 days in any one week) was documented in 17 to 25 percent of infants age &lt;6 weeks, 11 percent of those age 8 to 9 weeks, and 0.6 percent of those age 10 to 12 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-management-and-outcome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Some parents and families tolerate crying better than others.</p><p>Interventions are targeted to decrease crying and bolster the infant-family relationship. The goals of management are to help the parents cope with the child's symptoms and to prevent long-term sequelae in the parent-child relationship [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-management-and-outcome/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>Parental support is the mainstay of management. First-line interventions consist of addressing feeding problems and suggesting techniques to soothe the infant <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> decrease environmental stimuli. Parents can be encouraged to experiment with these interventions to see which, if any, work. Although the evidence supporting first-line interventions is limited, they are inexpensive, unlikely to be harmful, and may be helpful for parents who find it hard to have nothing to do while awaiting spontaneous remission (which confirms the diagnosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-management-and-outcome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Several interventions for colic have been evaluated in randomized trials; however, most of the trials had methodologic weaknesses (eg, small sample size, inadequate blinding) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-management-and-outcome/abstract/16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-20</a>]. The lack of strong supporting evidence for any one strategy, combined with the number of proposed etiologies, may lead practitioners to recommend a variety of interventions, alone or in combination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-management-and-outcome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Each of the soothing techniques may work in some infants or in a given infant, some of the time, but none of the interventions work all of the time.

In a controlled clinical trial in which parents of colicky infants were counseled regarding effective responses to crying, the crying decreased from 2.6 to 0.8 hours per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-management-and-outcome/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In a randomized trial, parental counseling was more effective than dietary changes (crying decreased from 3.2 to 1.1 hours per day in the counseling group and from 3.2 to 2.0 hours per day in the dietary change group) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-management-and-outcome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Home-based nursing intervention or contact with other parents who have or had infants with colic also may be beneficial.

In another study of 92 mother-infant pairs, specific care suggestions provided by a trained lay counselor were associated with greater reduction in crying (51 percent reduction) than empathetic counseling by a lay counselor (37 percent reduction) or no treatment (35 percent reduction) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-management-and-outcome/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H683887288\"><span class=\"h2\">First-line interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As first-line interventions for colic, we suggest changes to the feeding technique <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> experimenting with a number of techniques to soothe the infant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-management-and-outcome/abstract/24,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,30</a>]. These interventions address some of the potential etiologies of colic (eg, swallowed air, overstimulation). We generally initiate changes to feeding and soothing techniques at the same time, explaining the theories of the etiology of colic that they are meant to address. Although the evidence supporting these interventions is limited, they cost nothing, are unlikely to be harmful, and may be helpful for parents who find it hard to have nothing to do while awaiting spontaneous remission (which confirms the diagnosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-management-and-outcome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H683887444\"><span class=\"h3\">Feeding technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Feeding changes may be helpful for infants whose colic is associated with feeding problems (eg, underfeeding, overfeeding, inadequate burping). Bottle-feeding the baby in a vertical position (using a curved bottle) in combination with frequent burping may reduce swallowed air. Using a bottle with a collapsible bag also may help reduce air swallowing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-management-and-outcome/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Changes to breastfeeding technique also may be warranted. However, the management of breastfeeding problems should be individualized. Consultation with a lactation specialist may be warranted.

The soothing techniques can be tried in any order <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> combination. Parents can be instructed to try a technique for several minutes and if it does not work, move on to another soothing technique. The success or failure of individual soothing techniques may vary from one episode of colic to the next.

Other infants whose parents are coping well and have strong support networks can be seen less frequently (eg, at regularly scheduled health maintenance visits).

Some researchers have postulated that colic may disturb the child-parent interaction and thus have long-term effects on the family and child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-management-and-outcome/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. However, the data on the sequelae of colic are conflicting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h2\">Temperament and behavior</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies show that temper tantrums are more common among formerly colicky infants. In two follow-up studies, parents of formerly colicky infants reported more frequent temper tantrums at three and four years of age than parents of control children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-management-and-outcome/abstract/94,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">94,95</a>]. In a meta-analysis of longitudinal studies, the risk of behavior problems in later childhood was increased when colic persisted at five months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-management-and-outcome/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. The risk was greatest when persistent colic was accompanied by other regulatory problems (eg, feeding, sleeping) and psychosocial risk factors, which makes it difficult to establish a causal relationship [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-management-and-outcome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Parents of formerly colicky children perceive their toddlers' temperaments as more difficult than parents of noncolicky children. In a follow-up study, parents described their formerly colicky children as more emotional at age four years (eg, &quot;cries easily&quot; or &quot;tends to be somewhat upset&quot;) than noncolicky infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-management-and-outcome/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. Mothers in another one-year follow-up survey also rated their formerly colicky children as more difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-management-and-outcome/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. However, these children did not differ from control children according to the Toddler Temperament Scale. The discrepancy between the mother's perception of the child's temperament and the child's actual temperament may reflect the long-term effects of colic on mother-child interaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-management-and-outcome/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. Another possibility is that factors that predispose an infant to colic also cause problems with mother-child interactions.</p><p>In a prospective study, 48 infants (31 to 87 days of age) who were hospitalized with severe colic and 48 infants without chronic or severe illness who were hospitalized for problems unrelated to colic, gastrointestinal, allergic, or psychologic disease were followed up with at 10 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-management-and-outcome/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>].

In a case-control study, family functioning was assessed at one year of age in families of infants with and without colic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-management-and-outcome/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. Families in the severe colic group had more difficulties in communication, unresolved conflicts, dissatisfaction, and lack of empathy and flexibility. However, another case-control study performed when the child was three years old found no difference in family psychologic characteristics between case and control families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-management-and-outcome/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. Perhaps the effects of colic on family functioning are present early on but do not persist to three years of age.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h2\">Asthma and atopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prospective studies evaluating the development of asthma and atopy among infants with colic have conflicting results. In a study in which 983 infants were followed from infancy through 11 years of age, the prevalence of colic was approximately 9 percent. No association was found between infantile colic and asthma, allergic rhinitis, peak flow variability, or markers of atopy (total serum immunoglobulin E and allergy skin prick test) at any age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-management-and-outcome/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. In a subsequent smaller study with shorter follow-up, there was an association between infantile colic and allergic disorders (eg, allergic rhinitis, atopic eczema, food allergy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-management-and-outcome/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h2\">Cognitive development</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Colic does not appear to influence long-term cognitive development. In a prospective study of 327 children, approximately 15 percent had a history of colic (defined as &quot;daily uncontrolled crying without any obvious cause, persisting for at least two weeks&quot;), and 5 percent had a history of prolonged crying (colic-like crying that was reported at both 6 and 13 weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infantile-colic-management-and-outcome/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>].
