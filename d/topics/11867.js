The distribution of the modes of transmission of HIV infection varies in different countries. In the United States, male-to-male sexual contact and injection drug use (IDU) account for more than half of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-nonoccupational-exposures-to-hiv-and-hepatitis-b-and-c-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In contrast, in certain resource-limited areas (eg, Sub-Saharan Africa), penile-vaginal intercourse is responsible for 70 to 80 percent of HIV infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-nonoccupational-exposures-to-hiv-and-hepatitis-b-and-c-in-adults/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. </p><p>The risk of HIV infection also varies by the type of sexual or parenteral exposure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F60145\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60145 \">table 1</a>). Risk factors for HIV transmission include a high HIV viral load in the source, the presence or absence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), lack of circumcision, and certain host and genetic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-nonoccupational-exposures-to-hiv-and-hepatitis-b-and-c-in-adults/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].

Although the data supporting nPEP are limited, feasibility and safety data have led to widespread acceptance of this practice, which has been advanced by expert guideline committees [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-nonoccupational-exposures-to-hiv-and-hepatitis-b-and-c-in-adults/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H823699269\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of post-exposure prophylaxis'</a> below.)</p><p>The decision to initiate nPEP depends upon several factors. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of HIV acquisition. As an example, a person who engages in condomless receptive anal sex has a much greater estimated risk of HIV acquisition than a person who has oral sex (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F60145\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60145 \">table 1</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The amount of time that has elapsed after exposure, since nPEP should be administered as soon as possible and within 72 hours.

We consider <strong>any</strong> of the following to be a high-risk exposure:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Condomless receptive or insertive anal or vaginal intercourse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A percutaneous exposure to blood (or body fluids contaminated with blood)</p><p/><p>For patients who have had a high-risk exposure, we recommend initiating nPEP if the source is HIV-infected. We also suggest nPEP when the HIV status of the source is unknown if the source is at high risk for being HIV-infected (eg, man who has sex with men, injection drug user, sex worker), or if the patient was sexually assaulted. A more detailed discussion of the management of sexual assault victims is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-adult-and-adolescent-sexual-assault-victims#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of adult and adolescent sexual assault victims&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p>Some patients may desire nPEP if they had condomless sex with a source whose risk factors are unknown. For such patients, the decision to initiate nPEP depends upon the patient's exposure risk, such as the route of exposure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F60145\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60145 \">table 1</a>), and other cofactors that heighten risk of transmission (eg, presence of genital ulcer disease). If the indications for nPEP are unclear, clinicians can call the National Clinician's Post-Exposure Prophylaxis Hotline at 888-448-4911 for expert advice.</p><p>Certain patients repeatedly present with exposures that could qualify for nPEP (eg, discordant sex partners who rarely use condoms or injection drug users who often share injection equipment). For such patients, we do not offer nPEP repeatedly. Instead, we discuss the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis as an effective option for reducing the risk of subsequent HIV infection. Patients who adhere to their pre-exposure prophylaxis regimen do not require additional post-exposure prophylaxis for HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-nonoccupational-exposures-to-hiv-and-hepatitis-b-and-c-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Administration of pre-exposure prophylaxis against HIV infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For most patients, the duration of nPEP is 28 days. However, if the source is available and agrees to testing, post-exposure prophylaxis may be able to be discontinued if the HIV RNA is suppressed or if HIV testing returns negative. (See <a href=\"#H1728875958\" class=\"local\">'Duration of post-exposure prophylaxis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2651386458\" class=\"local\">'HIV and other testing'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H145249835\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing of HIV prophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonoccupational post-exposure prophylaxis should be given within 72 hours of an exposure. Once the need for nPEP has been identified, the patient should receive an immediate dose. The first dose should not be delayed pending HIV testing of either the exposed patient or the source. (See <a href=\"#H2651386458\" class=\"local\">'HIV and other testing'</a> below.)</p><p>Animal data suggest that there is a small window of opportunity to interrupt HIV transmission. A meta-analysis that included data from 25 nonhuman primate studies found a significant association between timing of post-exposure prophylaxis and reduced seroconversion after exposure to a closely related virus, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-nonoccupational-exposures-to-hiv-and-hepatitis-b-and-c-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In an early study of 24 macaques who received post-exposure prophylaxis with an experimental nucleoside analog, there was no evidence of viral replication if treatment was started within 24 hours of exposure; however, the efficacy of post-exposure prophylaxis decreased when the time between exposure and treatment was extended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-nonoccupational-exposures-to-hiv-and-hepatitis-b-and-c-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2973007501\"><span class=\"h2\">Antiviral therapy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2221781125\"><span class=\"h3\">Choice of regimen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We administer a three-drug regimen for nPEP given the efficacy of this combination in patients with chronic HIV infection, the improved tolerability of available treatment regimens, and the demonstrated safety of these agents.

Compared with the preferred regimens, there is an increased risk of drug interactions when a pharmacologic-boosting agent (ie, cobicistat or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ritonavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ritonavir</a>) is used. Information about specific drug interactions can be found in the Lexicomp drug interaction program within UpToDate.</p><p>A new form of tenofovir, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenofovir-alafenamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tenofovir alafenamide</a> (TAF), has less bone and renal toxicity compared with TDF, and is effective in suppressing HIV RNA when used as part of a combination regimen for HIV-infected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-nonoccupational-exposures-to-hiv-and-hepatitis-b-and-c-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, there are insufficient data to support the use of TAF in place of TDF for nPEP. TAF results in lower mucosal tenofovir levels compared with TDF, and may therefore be less effective in preventing HIV transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-nonoccupational-exposures-to-hiv-and-hepatitis-b-and-c-in-adults/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Although studies evaluating the use of TAF for nPEP are unlikely, studies evaluating TAF for pre-exposure prophylaxis are planned. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=administration-of-pre-exposure-prophylaxis-against-hiv-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Administration of pre-exposure prophylaxis against HIV infection&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3805638578\"><span class=\"h3\">Special considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When choosing a regimen special considerations include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the source is HIV-infected &mdash; We prefer a regimen that uses <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dolutegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dolutegravir</a> as the third agent if the source is known to be HIV-infected and there are concerns for drug-resistant virus (eg, the patient has failed multiple regimens or does not take their antiretroviral medications as prescribed). Alternatively, a pharmacologically-boosted protease inhibitor (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=darunavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">darunavir</a>) can be used. Resistance to either dolutegravir or darunavir is uncommon. The regimen can then be modified based upon the results of drug resistance testing, should they become available.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced kidney function &mdash; For individuals with reduced kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min),</span> we initiate TDF plus FTC at doses adjusted according to the patient's renal function. Refer to the Lexicomp drug information topics within UpToDate for specific dosing recommendations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some experts prefer to avoid TDF for nPEP in patients with reduced kidney function given concerns for renal toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-nonoccupational-exposures-to-hiv-and-hepatitis-b-and-c-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, the nephrotoxicity associated with TDF typically occurs with long-term administration, and we feel alternative NRTI combinations (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-and-lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine-lamivudine</a>) are associated with reduced tolerability, and even greater toxicity (eg, anemia).

Approximately one-third of the participants took nPEP. Over a median of 24 months, there were 11 HIV seroconversions (10 among non-nPEP users and 1 on nPEP).

The higher incidence of seroconversion in those who were prescribed and used post-exposure prophylaxis may reflect higher risk behavior in that group. Of note, 8 of the 11 nPEP users who were infected with HIV seroconverted more than three months following nPEP use, suggesting that their infections were not related to nPEP failure, but continued high-risk exposure.

(See <a href=\"#H145249835\" class=\"local\">'Timing of HIV prophylaxis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1345985201\" class=\"local\">'Determining the HIV status of the exposed person'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3217452234\" class=\"local\">'Determining the HIV status of the source'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients, we suggest a three-drug regimen using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate-and-emtricitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-emtricitabine</a> <strong>plus</strong> an integrase strand transfer inhibitor (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raltegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">raltegravir</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dolutegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dolutegravir</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, if the source is HIV-infected and there are concerns for multidrug-resistant virus, we prefer a regimen that uses dolutegravir or a pharmacologically-boosted protease inhibitor (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=darunavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">darunavir</a>) as the third agent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F83598\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83598 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2973007501\" class=\"local\">'Antiviral therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients receiving nPEP for HIV should receive a 28-day course of ART. After nPEP is discontinued, patients should have repeat HIV testing approximately 6 and 12 weeks after the exposure to assess for seroconversion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F66128\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66128 \">table 3</a>). If the source is known and is willing to be tested, nPEP may be able to be discontinued sooner. (See <a href=\"#H1728875958\" class=\"local\">'Duration of post-exposure prophylaxis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H69157132\" class=\"local\">'Patient monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a potential nonoccupational exposure to HIV should also be evaluated for HBV and HCV. If their status is unknown, we test the exposed patient for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc), hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs), and hepatitis C antibody. If the source is willing, they should be evaluated for these infections as well. Patients with a sexual exposure should also be offered <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> treated for other sexually transmitted infections, depending upon the type of exposure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F66128\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66128 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2722246844\" class=\"local\">'Testing for hepatitis B and C virus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a potential sexual or percutaneous exposure to HIV should also be evaluated for HBV post-exposure prophylaxis. If the source is HBsAg-positive or the HBV status is unknown, the need for immediate post-exposure prophylaxis depends primarily upon the exposed patient's HBV immune status and their vaccination history. (See <a href=\"#H3700952635\" class=\"local\">'Exposure to hepatitis B virus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no medications or immunizations to reduce the risk of acquiring HCV after a possible exposure. Thus, post-exposure management depends upon close monitoring and referral for treatment if infection does occur. We perform HCV testing in patients who have had a percutaneous exposure or a high-risk sexual exposure (eg, condomless receptive anal intercourse, sexual assault) unless the source tests negative for HCV RNA.
