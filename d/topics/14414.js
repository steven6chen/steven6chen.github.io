These events mostly occur in patients with evidence for ischemia due to coronary artery disease, disease of the myocardium (due to hypertrophy, fibrosis, scar replacement, or other myocardial abnormality that may or may not have been previously diagnosed), valvular abnormalities, or congenital channelopathies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and etiology of sudden cardiac arrest&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The event is referred to as SCA (or aborted SCD) if an intervention (eg, defibrillation) or spontaneous reversion of the heart rhythm restores circulation. The event is called SCD if the patient dies. However, the use of SCD to describe both fatal and nonfatal cardiac arrest persists by convention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-sudden-cardiac-death#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of sudden cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death&quot;, section on 'Definitions'</a>.)</p><p>The prognosis of patients who have SCA will be reviewed here.

As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A report analyzed outcomes for over 12,000 patients treated by emergency medical services (EMS) personnel in Seattle over 24 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-outcomes-following-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Survival to hospital discharge for those treated between 1998 and 2001 was not significantly better than for those treated between 1977 and 1981 (15.7 versus 17.5 percent). In contrast, the long-term outcome among patients who survive until hospital discharge following SCA appears to be improving [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-outcomes-following-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among a nationwide cohort of 547,153 patients in Japan with out-of-hospital SCA between 2005 and 2009, survival to hospital discharge with favorable neurologic status improved approximately twofold in several groups over the five-year period (from 1.6 to 2.8 percent among all patients with out-of-hospital SCA, from 2.1 to 4.3 percent among bystander-witnessed SCA, and from 9.8 to 20.6 percent among bystander-witnessed SCA with ventricular fibrillation as the initial rhythm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-outcomes-following-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, in spite of this doubling of neurologically favorable survival, overall survival following SCA remains poor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 70,027 US patients prospectively enrolled in the CARES registry following out-of-hospital SCA between 2005 and 2012, survival to hospital discharge improved significantly from 5.7 percent in 2005 to 8.3 percent in 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-outcomes-following-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Improvements were also noted in pre-hospital survival and neurologic function at hospital discharge. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a Canadian study of 34,291 patients who arrived at the hospital alive following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest between 2002 and 2011, survival at both 30-day and one-year increased significantly between 2002 and 2011 (from 7.7 to 11.8 percent for one-year survival) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-outcomes-following-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Similarly, among a cohort of 6999 Australian patients with out-of-hospital SCA resuscitated by EMS between 2010 and 2012, 851 patients (12.2 percent) survived for at least one year, with more than half of patients reporting good neurologic recovery and functional status at one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-outcomes-following-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p>The reasons for the continued poor survival of patients with SCA are not certain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-outcomes-following-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although some aspects of acute resuscitation have improved over time (increased bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and shortened time to defibrillation), these positive trends have been off-set by adverse trends in clinical features of patients presenting with SCA (such as increasing age and decreasing proportion presenting with ventricular fibrillation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-outcomes-following-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-adults/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>]. In addition, the response times of both basic life support (BLS) and advanced life support (ALS) services have increased, possibly as a result of population growth and urbanization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-outcomes-following-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>Marked regional differences in the incidence and outcome of SCA have been observed. In a prospective observational study of 10 North American regions, the adjusted incidence of EMS-treated out-of-hospital SCA ranged from 40.3 to 86.7 (median 52.1) per 100,000 census population; known survival to discharge ranged from 3.0 to 16.3 percent (median 8.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-outcomes-following-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The adjusted incidence of ventricular fibrillation ranged from 9.3 to 19.0 (median 12.6) per 100,000 census population; known survival to discharge ranged from 7.7 to 39.9 (median 22) percent. These regional differences highlight the importance of local health care and EMS systems to SCA outcomes. A pilot study comparing the feasibility of EMS transport to a regional cardiac arrest center (with increased transit time) versus transport to the closest hospital suggested no difference in 30-day mortality or major adverse cardiac events, results which should be considered hypothesis-generating for larger scale studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-outcomes-following-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1887028294\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurologic prognosis following sudden cardiac arrest</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Survivors of SCA have variable susceptibility to hypoxic-ischemic brain injury, depending on the duration of circulatory arrest, extent of resuscitation efforts, and underlying comorbidities. The prognosis following hypoxic-ischemic brain injury is discussed in detail separately.

Only 10 percent of patients with out-of-hospital arrests and initial asystole survive until hospital admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-outcomes-following-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-adults/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>] and only 0 to 2 percent until hospital discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-outcomes-following-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-adults/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. The poor outcome in patients with asystole or bradycardia due to a very slow idioventricular rhythm probably reflects the prolonged duration of the cardiac arrest (usually more than four minutes) and the presence of severe, irreversible myocardial damage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury-in-adults-evaluation-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in adults: Evaluation and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Factors associated with successful resuscitation of patients presenting with asystole include witnessed arrest, younger patient age, shorter time to arrival of EMS personnel, and no further need for treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a> for a bradyarrhythmia after initial resuscitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-outcomes-following-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-adults/abstract/12,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulseless electrical activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who have SCA due to pulseless electrical activity (PEA) (also called electrical-mechanical dissociation) also have a poor outcome. In one study of 150 such patients, 23 percent were resuscitated and survived to hospital admission; only 11 percent survived until hospital discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-outcomes-following-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Ventricular tachyarrhythmia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The outcome is much better when the initial rhythm is a sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia. The most frequent etiology is ventricular fibrillation (VF). Approximately 25 to 40 percent of patients with SCA caused by VF survive until hospital discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-outcomes-following-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-adults/abstract/1,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16,17</a>].

Patients with witnessed VF had a significantly greater likelihood of surviving to hospital discharge than those with other rhythms (34 versus 6 percent).</p><p>Acute myocardial infarction (MI) or myocardial ischemia is the underlying cause of VF for many of the patients who survive to hospital discharge. In a series of 79 such patients from the Mayo Clinic, 47 percent had an acute MI, while in a series of 47 such patients from the Netherlands, 51 percent had an acute MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-outcomes-following-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-adults/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>Survival is approximately 65 to 70 percent in patients who present with hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia (VT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-outcomes-following-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The prognosis may be better in patients found in monomorphic VT because of the potential for some systemic perfusion during this more organized arrhythmia. In addition, patients with VT tend to have a lower incidence of a previous infarction and a higher ejection fraction when compared with those with VF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-outcomes-following-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H594215622\"><span class=\"h2\">SCA due to noncardiac causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As many as one-third of cases of SCA are due to noncardiac causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-outcomes-following-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-adults/abstract/1,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,20</a>].

Electrical defibrillation is the <strong>only</strong> way to reestablish organized electrical activity and myocardial contraction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardioversion-for-specific-arrhythmias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardioversion for specific arrhythmias&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Increasing duration of VF has two major adverse effects: it reduces the ability to terminate the arrhythmia and, if VF continues for more than four minutes, there is the beginning of irreversible damage to the central nervous system and other organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-outcomes-following-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-adults/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. As a result, the longer the duration of the cardiac arrest, the lower the likelihood of resuscitation or survival with or without neurologic impairment even if CPR is successful. It has been suggested that without CPR, survival from a cardiac arrest caused by VF declines by approximately 10 percent for each minute without defibrillation, and after more than 12 minutes without CPR, the survival rate is only 2 to 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-outcomes-following-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-adults/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Time to resuscitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These observations constitute the rationale for attempts to provide more rapid resuscitation in patients with out-of-hospital SCA. One approach is optimizing the EMS system within a community to reduce the response interval to less than eight minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-outcomes-following-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>However, as noted above, the response times of both BLS and ALS services have actually increased, possibly as a result of population growth and urbanization. In the Seattle series of over 12,000 EMS-treated patients, the BLS response interval increased from 3.8 to 5.1 minutes between 1977 and 2001, and the ALS response interval increased from 8.4 to 9.0 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-outcomes-following-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Thus, bystander CPR and even defibrillation have been recommended and have been implemented in some settings. Such interventions permit more rapid responses than those provided by ALS or BLS personnel, with better survival as a result. In the Seattle series, the odds ratio for survival to discharge for patients who received bystander CPR to those who did not was 1.85 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-outcomes-following-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Bystander CPR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The administration of CPR by a layperson bystander (bystander CPR or bystander-initiated CPR) is an important factor in determining patient outcome after out-of-hospital SCA. As described in more detail below, survival after SCA is greater among those who have bystander CPR when compared with those who initially receive more delayed CPR from EMS personnel. In addition to improved survival, early restoration or improvement in circulation is associated with better neurologic function among survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-outcomes-following-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-adults/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>].</p><p>For adults with sudden out-of-hospital SCA, compression-only bystander CPR (without rescue breathing) appears to have equal or possibly greater efficacy compared with standard bystander CPR (compressions plus rescue breathing). The 2010 American Heart Association (AHA) Guidelines for CPR recommended that bystanders perform compression-only CPR to provide high-quality chest compressions prior to the arrival of emergency personnel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-outcomes-following-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-adults/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H93796253\" class=\"local\">'Chest compression-only CPR'</a> below.)</p><p>The importance of bystander CPR and support for compression-only bystander CPR comes from a combination of retrospective and prospective studies. An initial report from the Seattle Heart Watch program in the late 1970s evaluated 109 consecutive patients resuscitated at the scene by a bystander trained in CPR and compared their outcomes with those of 207 patients who initially received CPR from EMS personnel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-outcomes-following-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-adults/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. There was no difference between the two groups in the percentage of patients resuscitated at the scene and admitted alive to the hospital (67 versus 61 percent), but the percentage discharged alive was significantly higher among those with bystander CPR (43 versus 22 percent). The most important reason for the improvement in survival in this study was that earlier CPR and prompt defibrillation were associated with less damage to the central nervous system. More patients with bystander CPR were conscious at the time of hospital admission (50 versus 9 percent), and more regained consciousness by the end of hospitalization (81 versus 52 percent).</p><p>These observations were subsequently confirmed in larger studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-outcomes-following-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-adults/abstract/40,41,45-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41,45-49</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a nationwide study of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Japan between 2005 and 2012, during which time the number of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests grew by 33 percent (n = 17,882 in 2005 compared with n = 23,797 in 2012), rates of bystander CPR increased (from 39 to 51 percent), and recipients of bystander CPR had a significantly greater chance of neurologically intact survival (8.4 percent versus 4.1 percent without bystander CPR; odds ratio 1.52; 95% CI 1.45-1.60) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-outcomes-following-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

Although these data are promising, further studies will be required to validate the GO-FAR score in routine clinical practice. Until these studies are available, the GO-FAR score might best be used as an aid for patients <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> families to better understand the likely goals and outcomes of care.

The 2008 International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation cited preclinical evidence of harm from hyperoxia and suggested a goal arterial oxygenation of 94 to 96 percent post SCA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-outcomes-following-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-adults/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>].</p><p>A study to examine this issue was performed using a multicenter database including 6326 patients with arterial blood gas analysis within 24 hours after ICU arrival following cardiac arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-outcomes-following-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-adults/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. The study included patients with in-hospital and out-of-hospital SCA (57 percent were hospital inpatients and 43 percent were from the emergency department). Oxygenation status was categorized according to the first ICU arterial blood gas value, with hyperoxia defined as PaO2 &ge;300 mmHg, hypoxia as PaO2 &lt;60 mmHg, and the remaining as normoxia. The majority of patients had hypoxia (63 percent) with similar numbers having hyperoxia (18 percent) and normoxia (19 percent). The hyperoxia group had higher in-hospital mortality compared with the normoxia and the hypoxia groups (63 percent versus 45 percent and 57 percent). In a multivariable model, hyperoxia was an independent risk factor for death (OR 1.8; 95% CI, 1.5-2.2). Hypoxia was also an independent risk factor (OR 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.5). Further data are needed to determine the impact of oxygen titration during and after resuscitation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">LONG-TERM OUTCOME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reported long-term survival of resuscitated SCD is variable and may depend upon multiple factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with out-of-hospital ventricular fibrillation, was early defibrillation achieved?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do the data come from randomized trials, in which many, often sicker, patients are excluded, or from community-based observations?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Was the patient treated with early revascularization, antiarrhythmic drugs, or an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the patient have other risk factors, particularly a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do patients with seemingly transient or reversible causes of SCA have a better prognosis?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Did the episode of SCA begin as ventricular fibrillation (VF) or ventricular tachycardia (VT)?</p><p/><p>The potential effect of successful early defibrillation on long-term outcome following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to VF was assessed in a population-based study of 200 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-outcomes-following-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-adults/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. Over 70 percent of these patients survived until hospital admission, and 40 percent of these patients were discharged with mild or absent neurologic impairment. Among these 79 patients, 43 underwent coronary revascularization and 35 received an ICD, 13 of whom had subsequent shocks for VT or VF. The expected five-year survival of the study population (79 percent) was the same as that of age-, sex-, and disease-matched controls who did not have out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, but significantly lower than age- and sex-matched controls in the general population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

The reasons for the continued poor outcomes are likely multifactorial (eg, delayed bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation [CPR], delayed defibrillation, advanced age, decreased proportion presenting with ventricular fibrillation). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis following sudden cardiac arrest'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When SCA is due to a ventricular tachyarrhythmia, the outcome of resuscitation is better compared with those with asystole or pulseless electrical activity. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Outcome according to etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among the many factors that appear to have an influence on the outcome of SCA, the elapsed time prior to effective resuscitation (ie, establishment of an effective pulse) appears to be the most critical element. There are several ways to decrease the time to the onset of resuscitative efforts:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Rapid Emergency Medical System response &ndash; Optimizing the EMS system within a community to reduce the response interval to eight minutes or less has been proposed as a way to improve the outcomes of SCA. However, due to a variety of factors, EMS response time of eight minutes or less cannot always be achieved. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Time to resuscitation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Bystander CPR &ndash; The administration of CPR by a layperson bystander (bystander CPR) is an important factor in determining patient outcome after out-of-hospital SCA, as early restoration or improvement in circulation has been shown to result in greater survival and better neurologic function among survivors. Bystander CPR, however, is not always performed, primarily due to the bystander&rsquo;s lack of CPR training <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> concerns about possible transmission of disease while performing rescue breathing. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Bystander CPR'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Early defibrillation &ndash; The standard of care for resuscitation of SCA has been defibrillation as soon as possible when indicated. Shorter defibrillation response intervals correlate with greater survival to hospital discharge. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Timing of defibrillation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advanced-cardiac-life-support-acls-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Automated external defibrillators &ndash; The use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) by early responders is another approach to more rapid resuscitation. In most, but not all studies, AEDs have been found to improve survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=automated-external-defibrillators\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Automated external defibrillators&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several observational studies evaluating compression-only CPR versus standard CPR including rescue breathing reported no significant differences in survival or long-term neurologic function between the two groups, suggesting that compression-only CPR could be safely delivered (as long as the arrest is not a respiratory arrest). Three randomized trials of compression-only CPR versus standard CPR have all shown a trend toward improved outcomes in the compression-only CPR group, and a 2010 meta-analysis of the three randomized trials reported an increased survival to hospital discharge among patients who received compression-only CPR. As such, if a sole bystander is present or multiple bystanders are reluctant to perform mouth-to-mouth ventilation, we encourage the performance of CPR using chest compressions only. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Bystander CPR'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-life-support-bls-in-adults#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic life support (BLS) in adults&quot;, section on 'Chest compressions'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The induction of mild to moderate hypothermia (target temperature 32 to 34&ordm;C for 24 hours) may be beneficial in patients successfully resuscitated after a cardiac arrest. Improved neurologic outcome and reduced mortality has been demonstrated in series of patients with VF arrest in whom spontaneous circulation was restored, even when the patient remains comatose after resuscitation.
