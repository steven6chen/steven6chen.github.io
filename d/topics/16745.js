By 2030, this group will comprise about 20 percent of the total population, and among elderly persons, the percentage of patients &gt;75 and &gt;85 years old will increase disproportionately. A similar aging of the population is present in Western Europe and Japan.</p><p>The importance of this demographic increase in the number of elderly persons is magnified by the sharp rise in the incidence of most types of cancer after age 60 years. Currently, approximately 50 percent of all cancers and 70 percent of cancer deaths occur in those &ge;65 years old, and this fraction is expected to increase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-cancer-in-elderly-persons/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Despite the frequency with which cancer occurs in the elderly population, this group is significantly underrepresented in clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-cancer-in-elderly-persons/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Elderly patients who are enrolled in clinical trials represent a carefully selected subset. A systematic review of 345 cooperative group trials found no evidence of poorer survival or increased treatment-related mortality with experimental treatments compared with younger patients, despite concerns about an increased risk of toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-cancer-in-elderly-persons/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Even when substantial numbers of older patients are included, the results cannot be extrapolated to the entire elderly population. Patients with a poor performance status or renal, hepatic, or bone marrow dysfunction generally have been excluded, thus raising questions about the general applicability of data derived from such trials. This is particularly true for patients over 80 years.</p><p>Challenges specific to older patients with advanced cancer and the treatment of common malignancies in the elderly population will be reviewed here. Detailed discussions of the therapy of specific malignancies are presented separately, and additional information on specific chemotherapy drugs can be found in the UpToDate drug database.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CHALLENGES SPECIFIC TO ELDERLY PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The essential principles of treating advanced cancer in the elderly are the same as in younger patients. However, older patients, who may have age-related organ function decline and medical comorbidity, require special attention to the risks of chemotherapy (both treatment-related toxicity and quality of life [QOL] issues), particularly in the context of estimated life expectancy.</p><p>The following age-related changes should be considered when assessing the risk of systemic chemotherapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Age-related organ function decline</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aging is commonly accompanied by a decline in the function of critical organ systems, and this declining organ function probably underlies age-related loss of physiologic reserve. Older patients with little reserve are at risk for decompensation upon exposure to severe stresses such as chemotherapy. This has several implications for elderly patients undergoing chemotherapy.</p><p>Chronologic age may not correlate with physiologic impairment and decline in functional reserve, both of which vary substantially between individuals. Thus, treatment of cancer in elderly persons should focus on the extent of comorbidity and functional status rather than chronologic age.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Liver</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aging is associated with a decline in hepatic volume and hepatic blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-cancer-in-elderly-persons/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. As a result, drug metabolism and elimination may be slowed, potentially exposing patients to higher drug concentrations for longer periods of time. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Liver function and metabolism'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with a large burden of liver metastases may have a greater than expected degree of hepatic decompensation. In the setting of decreased volume of normal hepatic parenchyma, careful monitoring of liver function is recommended in older patients, particularly when drugs metabolized by the liver are being used. In addition, comorbidities such as alcohol abuse or a history of viral hepatitis may be relevant considerations in treatment decisions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chemotherapy-hepatotoxicity-and-dose-modification-in-patients-with-liver-disease#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chemotherapy hepatotoxicity and dose modification in patients with liver disease&quot;, section on 'Impact of preexisting liver disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Kidney</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Renal function, as measured by the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), falls with age. However, age-related loss of muscle mass makes the serum creatinine concentration alone less reliable as a marker of GFR in older patients. Estimation equations have been derived to estimate GFR. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Kidney function and drug excretion'</a> below.)</p><p>Because of the diminished renal reserve in elderly patients, volume depletion can lead to exaggerated reductions in renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-cancer-in-elderly-persons/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Thus, careful attention should be paid to fluid management in patients who develop chemotherapy-associated vomiting or diarrhea.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Bone marrow function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bone marrow reserve diminishes as a part of normal aging, placing older patients at greater risk for severe and prolonged chemotherapy-related cytopenias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-cancer-in-elderly-persons/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Dose reduction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> delay may be necessary; another alternative is the use of hematopoietic growth factor support during treatment. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Bone marrow'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Heart</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normal aging is associated with an increasing risk of coronary artery disease, an increased frequency and severity of valvular heart disease, and a decrease in ventricular compliance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-cancer-in-elderly-persons/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The possibility of exacerbating age-related abnormalities should be considered when potentially cardiotoxic drugs are being used. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-monitoring-and-diagnosis-of-anthracycline-induced-cardiotoxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, monitoring, and diagnosis of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-management-of-anthracycline-cardiotoxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and management of anthracycline cardiotoxicity&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiotoxicity-of-trastuzumab-and-other-her2-targeted-agents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiotoxicity of trastuzumab and other HER2-targeted agents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiotoxicity-of-nonanthracycline-cancer-chemotherapy-agents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiotoxicity of nonanthracycline cancer chemotherapy agents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H717698673\"><span class=\"h3\">Muscle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sarcopenia, increased age, and inactivity may all contribute to loss of muscle mass. Unlike cachexia, sarcopenia, which is defined by loss of skeletal muscle mass two standard deviations below sex-specific normal values for young adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-cancer-in-elderly-persons/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], does not require the presence of weight loss. Whereas most people with cachexia are sarcopenic, most sarcopenic individuals are not considered cachectic. Muscle loss without the loss or gain in fat is known as sarcopenic obesity, which is prevalent in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-cancer-in-elderly-persons/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>] and is also noted in advanced cancer. The causes of sarcopenia are multifactorial and can include disuse; changing endocrine function; chronic diseases; inflammation; insulin resistance; nutritional deficiencies; some forms of cancer treatment, notably <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorafenib</a> and androgen deprivation therapy; and specific cancers, notably non-small cell lung cancer.

The most common conditions are anemia (often from occult blood loss related to the primary tumor), hypertension, gastrointestinal diagnoses, and heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-cancer-in-elderly-persons/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>For seriously ill patients with severe comorbid illness that results in a short life expectancy (particularly one year or less), the risks of chemotherapy often outweigh its benefits. Most of these patients should receive supportive care rather than chemotherapy, with attention to palliation of symptoms. Available prognostic tools for use in clinical decision-making for older adults are available through <a href=\"http://eprognosis.ucsf.edu/&amp;token=FEE6F0JlRVF1b9TeuaII9KQd7CLxTAQWAQ1djW/ZYbXIC4LkjJFTXUWC0NEtoVA7&amp;TOPIC_ID=2823\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://eprognosis.ucsf.edu/</a>.

The available data suggest that older patients are just as willing to try chemotherapy as their younger counterparts, but less willing to endure severe treatment-related side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-cancer-in-elderly-persons/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>There are few data about how chemotherapy affects QOL in older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-cancer-in-elderly-persons/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A major unanswered issue is whether the higher response rates and generally longer survival seen with modern combination regimens (as compared with a strategy of sequential single agents) are outweighed by the greater likelihood of side effects and adverse impact on QOL.

These pharmacokinetic differences may be caused by alterations in excretion, metabolism, distribution, and absorption.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Kidney function and drug excretion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a gradual decline in kidney function with age in most people, including those without hypertension or known renal disease. This decline results in a significant percentage of the elderly population with a calculated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Impaired renal function can result in higher peak drug levels and more prolonged exposure to chemotherapy, causing excessive toxicity with agents that are dependent upon renal excretion for their clearance (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a>), particularly when they are combined with other agents that also are associated with renal dysfunction (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]). </p><p>The serum creatinine is <strong>not</strong> a reliable indicator of renal function in elderly patients, since a reduction in the GFR may be obscured by a simultaneous loss of muscle mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-cancer-in-elderly-persons/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. Various equations are used to estimate the creatinine clearance; these are based upon measurement of a <strong>stable</strong> serum creatinine, as well as age and body weight. A calculator is available to calculate the creatinine clearance based upon the ideal body weight and the serum creatinine level (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-creatinine-clearance-estimate-by-cockcroft-gault-equation-in-adults-and-older-adolescents-age-18-years\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>).

This more polar compound is then excreted, either in the bile or by the kidneys.</p><p/><p>Although liver size and hepatic blood flow are decreased with aging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-cancer-in-elderly-persons/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], these changes are not of sufficient magnitude to require routine dose modification in elderly individuals. However, concurrent hepatic impairment, due to the malignancy or other comorbid conditions, may necessitate dose adjustments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Distribution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The distribution of drugs is affected by body composition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-cancer-in-elderly-persons/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In the elderly population, the fat content doubles from approximately 15 to 30 percent of body weight, while intracellular water decreases (33 versus 42 percent in the average 25 year old) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-cancer-in-elderly-persons/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. These changes increase peak blood concentrations of more polar drugs while decreasing peak concentrations but lengthening half-lives of lipid-soluble drugs. In addition, decreases in plasma albumin and red blood cell concentration are often present with aging, and this can affect the pharmacokinetics of agents that are bound to albumin or erythrocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-cancer-in-elderly-persons/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>These pharmacokinetic alterations in drug distribution in the elderly population have not been shown to necessitate dose modifications based upon age.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Absorption</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atrophy of the intestinal mucosa and decreases in gastrointestinal motility, splanchnic blood flow, and secretion of digestive enzymes all can contribute to a decreased rate of drug absorption in elderly adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-cancer-in-elderly-persons/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Although absorption of orally administered drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capecitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capecitabine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temozolomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">temozolomide</a> may be affected by changes in the gastrointestinal tract, the magnitude of such changes does not justify dose modification based upon age. Furthermore, the emphasis on oral therapy makes compliance an important issue in treatment, as a significant number of patients fail to take oral anticancer therapy as prescribed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-cancer-in-elderly-persons/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">COMORBIDITY AND FUNCTIONAL STATUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aging is a highly individualized, multidimensional process. Chronologic age does not reliably predict physiologic decline.</p><p>The process of aging has been represented as a continuum ranging from functional independence to pre-death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-chemotherapy-for-cancer-in-elderly-persons/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. At one end of this spectrum, a healthy older individual has no significant limitations in activity and only minimally reduced functional reserve. With progressive increase in comorbidity, an individual becomes more vulnerable and has a decreased functional reserve. This physiologic decline results in significant limitations, although there may be the ability for some recovery. Frailty, the far end of the spectrum, is characterized by severe limitations with little or no ability to withstand treatment or serious illness.</p><p>Chronologic age alone is not an indication for a change in therapeutic plan or drug dosing in elderly adults. If renal function is normal and there is no significant comorbidity, most chemotherapy agents can be given in full doses.

For appropriately selected patients with minimal comorbidity and a good performance status who are candidates for chemotherapy, combination chemotherapy rather than single-agent chemotherapy may be preferred. For patients who, in the judgment of the treating clinician, cannot tolerate combination chemotherapy, single-agent therapy may be considered.
