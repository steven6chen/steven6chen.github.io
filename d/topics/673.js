Toxic ingestion causes a syndrome of acute gastroenteritis within minutes to hours of consumption followed by delayed onset renal failure within one week. Although uncommon, <em>Amanita smithiana</em> poisoning has increased in frequency over the last two decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amanita-smithiana-mushroom-poisoning/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It represents the only known mushroom poisoning syndrome where ingestion of a single type of mushroom can have immediate acute effects that are followed by serious delayed toxicity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77875\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77875 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>This topic will discuss the epidemiology, toxicity, clinical manifestations, and management of <em>Amanita smithiana</em> mushroom poisoning.

Ingestion has also been reported in Southeast Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amanita-smithiana-mushroom-poisoning/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. <em>A. smithiana</em> mushrooms grow in the autumn until the time of the first frost, typically growing near dead or rotting wood. </p><p>Toxicity from <em>Amanita smithiana</em> was first described in 1964, although its toxic effects were misattributed to <em>A. phalloides</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amanita-smithiana-mushroom-poisoning/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Following the initial report, almost 30 years passed without a documented case. In the 1990s, <em>A. smithiana</em> mushroom poisoning became more commonly described in association with increasing culinary popularity and economic value of the matsutake or pine mushroom (<em>Tricholoma</em> <em>magnivelare</em>), which has a similar habitat and appearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amanita-smithiana-mushroom-poisoning/abstract/2,5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5-7</a>]. Publication of the book &quot;Matsutake Mushroom: White gold rush of the 1990s&quot; in 1997 coincided with the largest spike in reports of these ingestions in 1997 and 1998 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amanita-smithiana-mushroom-poisoning/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In all cases of poisoning reported to date, <em>A. smithiana</em> have been ingested by individuals collecting and preparing the look-alike matsutake or pine mushroom (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69427\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69427 \">picture 1</a>) for personal culinary use. </p><p>Matsutake mushrooms are also extremely desirable for commercial culinary use. Matsutakes have been gathered in regions where <em>A. smithiana</em> is native and sold to restaurants in areas where <em>A. smithiana</em> is not, making poisoning possible outside of the West coast of North America or Southeast Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amanita-smithiana-mushroom-poisoning/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Children are also at risk from unintentional sampling of the <em>A. smithiana</em> mushroom although exploratory mushroom ingestions in children typically consist of one bite and serious poisoning in this setting is rare.

Smithiana</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amanita-smithiana-mushroom-poisoning/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Although these mushrooms were not found to contain allenic norleucine, the purported toxin in <em>A. smithiana</em>, they did have a substance identified by thin layer chromatography that was also found in a toxic extract from <em>A. smithiana</em>. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5480951\"><span class=\"h1\">MUSHROOM APPEARANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mushroom identification is usually not readily available during the acute phase of care, and most mushrooms causing toxicity are never correctly identified. However, if possible, determination of the specific type of mushroom ingested can be helpful for treatment recommendations and prognosis. Consultation with a medical toxicologist and professional mycologist is strongly advised when attempting mushroom identification (US regional poison control center: 1-800-222-1222 or access the World Health Organization's list of international poison centers [<a href=\"http://www.who.int/gho/phe/chemical_safety/poisons_centres/en/index.html&amp;token=vYXClxsD0hnrf4M8kYcoD1kMICrGjKQRRaFc8pA0pw9qlhpVmsmYh2e3Gi7webw9H9uSzH3nipQ0rPpTLYBWhGP+/wpQqUegRzvggwgKA6s=&amp;TOPIC_ID=13895\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.who.int/gho/phe/chemical_safety/poisons_centres/en/index.html</a>]).</p><p><em>Amanita smithiana</em> is usually white, though color can vary (brown, gray, or yellow) based upon weather during growth.

Both raw and cooked <em>A. smithiana</em> appear to cause toxicity, suggesting allenic norleucine is a heat-stable toxin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amanita-smithiana-mushroom-poisoning/abstract/2,5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5-7</a>].</p><p>Allenic norleucine is not related to amatoxin found in other more commonly ingested and phylogenetically related Amanita mushrooms such as <em>Amanita phalloides, A. virosa</em>, <em>A. verna</em>, or <em>A. bisporigera</em>. </p><p>Several observations indicate that allenic norleucine rather than orelline or other toxins cause the renal toxicity seen in <em>Amanita smithiana</em> poisoning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amanita-smithiana-mushroom-poisoning/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allenic norleucine and <em>A. smithiana</em> extract caused identical renal tubular epithelial cell necrosis within 12 hours in a cell culture model. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal tubular epithelial cells incubated with orelline (the toxin from the largest group of delayed renal toxicity mushrooms) displayed a different pattern of toxicity and slower onset of cell death.

A regional poison control center should be contacted to discuss likely mushroom species ingested based upon clinical findings, identification of any mushrooms available for analysis, and treatment of specific toxic effects. Most poison control centers maintain active call lists of mycologists who are knowledgeable concerning local prevalence of mushroom genera and species and can assist in mushroom identification.

The recommendation for AC administration soon after <em>A. smithiana</em> mushroom consumption derives from indirect evidence of benefit in volunteers who ingested other toxins, animal studies, and evidence of benefit following ingestions of other mushrooms. Mushrooms, like most complex xenobiotics, bind well to activated charcoal. Because diarrhea is a common occurrence after <em>A. smithiana</em> poisoning, the combination of a cathartic (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorbitol</a>) and AC should be avoided. The greatest benefit occurs if AC is given within one hour of ingestion. Of note, AC is unlikely to be of benefit in most instances of <em>A. smithiana</em> poisoning because patients do not typically seek medical attention until days after mushroom consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/amanita-smithiana-mushroom-poisoning/abstract/2,5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5-7</a>]. </p><p>The efficacy of AC as a function of time from ingestion is discussed in detail separately.

This recommendation is based upon randomized controlled trials showing minimal benefit and possible risk to patients who undergo gastric emptying after poisoning.
