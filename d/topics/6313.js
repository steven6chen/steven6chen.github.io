It most commonly presents in childhood, but one-fourth of cases are diagnosed in adults. T1DM remains the most common form of diabetes in childhood, accounting for approximately two-thirds of new diagnoses of diabetes in patients &le;19 years of age in the United States, despite the increasing rate of type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p>The epidemiology, presentation, and diagnosis of T1DM in children and adolescents are presented here. The pathogenesis of T1DM and the management and complications of childhood T1DM are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of type 1 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-and-screening-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications and screening in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The assessment and management of individuals presenting during infancy with hyperglycemia also are discussed separately.

In Europe and China, the risk appears to rise as the geographical latitude (distance from the equator) increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. This North-South variation is not found in the United States, even after adjusting for racial and ethnic variation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. When people relocate from a region of low to high incidence, their risk of developing T1DM also increases, suggesting a causative role for environmental factor(s). However, wide variations in incidence occur between neighboring areas of similar latitude, suggesting the presence of other contributing risk factors and demonstrating the complexity of the pathogenesis of T1DM. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The highest reported incidences of T1DM occur in Finland and Sardinia (37 to 65 per 100,000 children younger than the age of 15 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

In the United States, the incidence of T1DM in non-Hispanic white children and adolescents is 23.6 per 100,000 per year, and rates are substantially lower in other racial or ethnic groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Some parts of Canada, such as Newfoundland, have a higher incidence (36 per 100,000 per year) than the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Overall, about 45 percent of children present before 10 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>Although most autoimmune diseases are more common in females, there appears to be no gender difference in the overall incidence of childhood T1DM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, in select populations, T1DM occurs more frequently in males. As an example, older males of European origin (&ge;13 years of age) are more likely to develop T1DM than females of similar age and geographic location, with an approximate 3:2 male to female ratio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. The same 3:2 male to female ratio also was reported in children younger than six years of age in an observational study from Massachusetts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22151378\"><span class=\"h2\">Time trends</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of childhood T1DM is rising worldwide, with reported increases of 2 to 5 percent per year in Europe, the Middle East, and Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/11,24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,24-27</a>]. In the United States, the overall incidence of T1DM also appears to be rising in most age and ethnic groups, with an average annual increase of about 2 percent, and higher rates among Hispanic compared with non-Hispanic white youth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. The reasons for the increasing incidence are unknown. </p><p>The rise appears to be primarily in younger children. A report using data from 17 European countries revealed an annual rate increase of 5.4, 4.3, and 2.9 percent for the age groups 0 to 4, 5 to 9, and 10 to 14 years, respectively, over the 15-year period from 1989 to 2003; the overall increase was 3.9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. If these trends continue, the number of new cases of T1DM in children younger than five years of age may double in some regions between 2005 and 2020; furthermore, prevalent cases in children under 15 years will rise by 70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Data reported from Philadelphia show that the incidence in children less than five years of age increased by 70 percent between 1985 and 2004 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The trend towards younger age of onset is not seen in all populations. One study from Sweden reported increases in age at diagnosis for children born in or after 2000, reversing the previous trend [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

Patients typically present with the following symptoms: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polyuria &ndash; Polyuria occurs when the serum glucose concentration rises significantly above 180 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> exceeding the renal threshold for glucose, which leads to increased urinary glucose excretion. Glycosuria causes osmotic diuresis (ie, polyuria) and hypovolemia. Polyuria may present as nocturia, bedwetting, or daytime incontinence in a previously continent child. In children who are not toilet trained, parents may note an increased frequency of wet diapers <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diapers that are unusually heavy (wet). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polydipsia &ndash; Polydipsia is due to enhanced thirst because of increased serum osmolality from hyperglycemia and hypovolemia. Despite the hypovolemia, patients may not have the classic signs of dry mucus membranes or decreased skin turgor. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss &ndash; Weight loss is a result of hypovolemia and increased catabolism. Insulin deficiency in diabetic children impairs glucose utilization in skeletal muscle and increases fat and muscle breakdown. Initially, appetite is increased, but over time, children are more thirsty than hungry, and ketosis leads to nausea and anorexia, contributing to weight loss.</p><p/><p>Patients with these symptoms usually present in the ambulatory setting appearing slightly ill, with vague complaints, such as weight loss and lethargy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

The classic symptoms of polyuria and polydipsia are present in more than 90 percent of patients, but these are not always the initial complaints and may become apparent only after obtaining a careful history (eg, nocturia and bedwetting, increased frequency <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> unusually wet diapers, and persistent thirst). Weight loss is a presenting symptom in about half of children. </p><p>Other presentations include perineal candidiasis, which is a relatively common presenting symptom in young children and in girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Symptoms are similar but usually more severe than those of patients without acidosis. In addition to polyuria, polydipsia, and weight loss, patients with ketoacidosis may present with a fruity-smelling breath and neurologic findings including drowsiness and lethargy. DKA can be misinterpreted as an acute vomiting illness because classic pediatric symptoms of dehydration (decreased urination) are masked by the polyuria that is associated with glycosuria.

In addition, children younger than six years of age are more likely to present with DKA, because health care personnel and families less often suspect diabetes in this age group. This leads to a prolonged duration of illness and more severe metabolic decompensation before diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/23,48,53,56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,48,53,56,57</a>]. </p><p>Children in this age group also have polydipsia and polyuria, but these symptoms are difficult to detect if the child is in diapers or is nonverbal and unable to communicate thirst.

The history or presence of prolonged or recurrent candidal infection (usually in the diaper area) is an important clue that should raise suspicion about the possibility of diabetes mellitus in young children. Candidal infection was present at diagnosis in a significant proportion of children younger than six years with T1DM, and especially in those younger than two years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>These patients often have been seen by a clinician for nonspecific complaints before the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

The initial step is to diagnose diabetes. The second step is to differentiate T1DM from other causes of diabetes based upon the clinical presentation of the patient and laboratory studies.

This criterion is more useful to diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T<strong>2</strong>DM) in adults, and should be confirmed by hyperglycemia.</p><p/><p>Based upon the guidelines of the American Diabetes Association (ADA), these diagnostic criteria resemble those used in adults with diabetes. Unless unequivocal symptomatic hyperglycemia is present, the diagnosis should be confirmed by repeat testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-diabetes-mellitus-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of diabetes mellitus in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A1C measures the percent of hemoglobin A bound to glucose via non-enzymatic glycation, and indicates the average blood sugar levels for 10 to 12 weeks before the time of measurement. A1C &ge;6.5 percent is now an accepted criterion for diagnosis of diabetes in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. However, the diagnostic utility of A1C for children is less well established than for adults. A1C values &ge;6.5 percent are diagnostic of diabetes in adults, but levels &lt;6.5 percent do not exclude diabetes. Of note, in one study from Germany, all children with symptomatic, new-onset T1DM had a glycated hemoglobin &ge;6.35 percent, whereas those with transient hyperglycemia had A1C values ranging from 4.5 to 6.1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. </p><p>Individuals with abnormal hemoglobins or rapid destruction of red blood cells may have a measured A1C value that does not accurately reflect their average blood sugar values. The accuracy of measurements in individuals with abnormal hemoglobins will improve with use of improved techniques for assessing A1C and with standardization of A1C measurements. For example, hemoglobin variants and derivatives interfere very minimally with the commercially available boronate-affinity chromatography technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].

For example, patients with renal glucosuria or Fanconi syndrome will present with glycosuria but have normal plasma glucose concentration. Similarly, the presence of islet-specific autoantibodies supports the diagnosis of T1DM (as discussed in the next section), but is not sufficient to make the diagnosis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Type 1 versus type 2 diabetes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>T1DM is characterized primarily by insulin deficiency, whereas type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is characterized primarily by insulin resistance with relative insulin deficiency. As the incidence of T2DM increases in children and adolescents, it becomes increasingly important to distinguish type 1 from type 2 disease, because long-term management differs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-diabetes-mellitus-and-genetic-diabetic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of diabetes mellitus and genetic diabetic syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>No set of criteria or diagnostic test can consistently distinguish between T1DM and T2DM.

In contrast, children with T1DM are usually not obese and often have a recent history of weight loss, although up to 25 percent are overweight (BMI &ge;85<sup>th</sup> to 95<sup>th</sup> percentile) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age &ndash; Patients with T2DM generally present after the onset of puberty, whereas those with T1DM often present at an earlier age. About 45 percent of children with T1DM present before 10 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Age and gender'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insulin resistance &ndash; Patients with T2DM frequently have acanthosis nigricans (a sign of insulin resistance), hypertension, dyslipidemia, and polycystic ovary syndrome (in girls). These findings are less likely in children with T1DM. As an example, in studies in the United States, 50 to 90 percent of youth diagnosed with T2DM have acanthosis nigricans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,63</a>]. Among those clinically diagnosed with T1DM, up to 25 percent have biochemical evidence of insulin resistance, and about 12 percent have acanthosis nigricans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family history &ndash; Up to 10 percent of patients with T1DM have an affected close relative, whereas 75 to 90 percent of those with T2DM have an affected close relative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/2,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,64</a>].</p><p/><p>Laboratory testing &ndash; The following laboratory tests are often helpful in differentiating between T1DM and T2DM. We suggest including them in the evaluation: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibodies &ndash; Although there is no specific test to distinguish between the two types of diabetes, T1DM is suggested by the presence of circulating, islet-specific, pancreatic autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65), the 40K fragment of tyrosine phosphatase (IA2), insulin, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8). However, the absence of pancreatic autoantibodies does not rule out the possibility of T1DM. Up to 30 percent of individuals with the classical appearance and presentation of T2DM have positive autoantibodies and may have a slowly progressive type of autoimmune diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].

Levels are inappropriately low or in the normal range relative to the concomitant plasma glucose concentration in T1DM. At presentation, insulin and C-peptide levels may be suppressed by severe hyperglycemia and illness. It is usually best to assess these levels after the newly diagnosed patient has recovered from acute illness. </p><p/><p>Insulin deficiency in T1DM most commonly results from autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells and is referred to as type 1A diabetes (approximately 85 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Patients with clinical features of T1DM but without detectable autoantibodies are categorized as having type 1B diabetes (approximately 15 percent). In these patients, there is no evidence of autoimmune beta-cell destruction and no other cause has been identified. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-diabetes-mellitus-and-genetic-diabetic-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of diabetes mellitus and genetic diabetic syndromes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some patients may have mixed features, and are difficult to classify. As an example, in a registry study in the United States, pediatric diabetes was classified based upon the presence or absence of beta cell autoimmunity and the presence or absence of insulin sensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. More than 70 percent of patients fell into traditional categories of autoimmune and insulin sensitive T1DM (55 percent) or nonautoimmune and insulin resistant T2DM (16 percent). An additional 20 percent had both autoimmunity and insulin resistance, a pattern typical for obese patients with T1DM. The remaining 10 percent of patients were insulin sensitive in the absence of islet cell autoimmunity, most of whom were clinically categorized as T1DM (ie, type 1B diabetes), and the remainder as T2DM (suggesting that these patients need additional evaluation for the possibility of monogenic diabetes, formerly referred to as maturity onset diabetes of the young [MODY]).

This is usually best accomplished by measuring 24-hour urinary cortisol excretion or salivary cortisol at 11 PM or midnight two or more times; additional testing may be required. It is important to recognize that children with Cushing syndrome may not manifest the classic features seen in adults. However, a deceleration of growth velocity despite increasing weight should raise concern for Cushing syndrome in a growing child. It is very rare for a child with Cushing syndrome to present with hyperglycemia, although relatively common in adults.

Many different genetic abnormalities have been identified, each leading to a different type of disease. Monogenic diabetes should be suspected in a patient presenting with non-insulin-dependent diabetes at a young age (&lt;25 years), with autosomal dominant transmission across three generations, lack of islet autoantibodies, and lack of acanthosis nigricans.

Although no one diagnostic test can distinguish between the two types of diabetes, T1DM is suggested by the presence of serum autoantibodies against islet cells, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65), the 40K fragment of tyrosine phosphatase (IA2), insulin, or zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8), and by low or inappropriately normal fasting C-peptide and insulin levels with concomitant hyperglycemia. C-peptide and insulin levels are generally not required to make the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Type 1 versus type 2 diabetes'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Other causes of diabetes'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of T1DM is often missed in young children because it is not considered, and because it may be difficult to recognize the symptoms of hyperglycemia in this age group. Children younger than two years of age are particularly likely to have a delay in diagnosis. In these patients, a history or presence of prolonged candidal infection should prompt consideration of diabetes mellitus and measurement of blood and urine glucose concentrations.
