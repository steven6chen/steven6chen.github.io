There are three types of ACS: ST elevation (formerly Q-wave) MI (STEMI), non-ST elevation (formerly non-Q wave) MI (NSTEMI), and unstable angina (UA). The first two are characterized by a typical rise <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fall in biomarkers of myocyte injury.</p><p>Two multicenter, international surveys published in 2002, the Euro Heart Survey and the GRACE registry, determined the relative frequency of these disorders in approximately 22,000 patients admitted with an ACS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].

These criteria were epidemiological and aimed at specificity. A joint European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and American College of Cardiology committee proposed a more clinically based definition of an acute, evolving, or recent MI in 2000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In 2007, the Joint Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology, American College of Cardiology Foundation, the American Heart Association, and the World Heart Federation <span class=\"nowrap\">(ESC/ACCF/AHA/WHF)</span> refined the 2000 criteria and defined acute MI as a clinical event consequent to the death of cardiac myocytes (myocardial necrosis) that is caused by ischemia (as opposed to other etiologies such as myocarditis or trauma) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Due to the insensitivity of creatine kinase MB fraction (CK-MB) compared to troponin, the finding of a normal CK-MB does not entirely exclude the diagnosis of MI using the current definition. Elevations of troponin with contemporary assays probably take two to three hours, while elevations for CK-MB take longer. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Cardiac biomarkers'</a> below.)</p><p>UA and NSTEMI are frequently indistinguishable at initial evaluation. ST segment <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> T wave changes are often persistent in NSTEMI, while, if they occur in UA, they are usually transient. Regardless, of the category, ST segment change defines a higher-risk group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H107850186\"><span class=\"h2\">After revascularization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The definitions of MI in the setting of PCI or CABG are presented above. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Acute MI'</a> above.)</p><p>Following revascularization with either CABG or PCI, cardiac biomarkers may rise. Transient elevations in troponins may represent necrosis, although the mechanism is unknown. Higher elevations are associated with worse prognosis after CABG. A discussion of MI following PCI is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=periprocedural-myocardial-infarction-following-percutaneous-coronary-intervention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Periprocedural myocardial infarction following percutaneous coronary intervention&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The Joint <span class=\"nowrap\">ESC/ACCF/AHA/WHF</span> Task Force for the Redefinition of Myocardial Infarction addressed the issue of biomarker rise after revascularization procedures (Type 4a) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. For patients undergoing PCI, a normal baseline troponin value (&ge;99<sup>th</sup> percentile URL) is mandatory in order to use the definition above. If the baseline value is elevated or rising, it is impossible to tell if elevations post-procedure are related to the initial insult or to additional injury. However, they also state that if the troponin values are stable or falling before revascularization, the use of the reinfarction criteria may be reasonable. We also believe it is reasonable to obtain a troponin prior to (within six hours of) PCI (a baseline value). (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Recommended approach'</a> below.)</p><p>No criteria have been established to separate expected rises (such as needle trauma to the myocardium at CABG) from those that represent a complication of the procedure (such as unexpected coronary artery dissection due to wire trauma at PCI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

For example, in 2013, the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions proposed the following definition for &ldquo;clinically relevant MI&rdquo; after coronary revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. For patients undergoing PCI or CABG who have a normal baseline CK-MB, MI was defined as that resulting in CK-MB &ge;10 X the upper limit of normal (ULN), or a lower threshold of &ge;5 X the ULN in patients in whom new pathologic Q-waves in &ge;2 contiguous ECG leads (or new persistent LBBB) develop after PCI. Separate criteria were given for individuals without a normal value for CK-MB at baseline.</p><p>Although we and others agree that there are likely to be changes to the Universal Definition based on a better understanding of the relationship between elevated postprocedural troponin values and the subsequent risk of clinical events, we recommend use of the Universal Definition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Prior MI</span></p><p>According to the third universal definition of MI, any one of the following three criteria satisfies the diagnosis for a prior (established) MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pathologic Q waves (&ge;0.04 sec) with or without symptoms in the absence of non-ischemic causes</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pathologic findings of a healed or healing MI</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evidence from an imaging study of a region of loss of viable myocardium that is thinned and fails to contract in the absence of a nonischemic cause.

In the Registry report, patients without chest pain were much less likely to be diagnosed with a confirmed MI on admission (22 versus 50 percent in those with chest pain) and were less likely to be treated with appropriate medical therapy and to receive fibrinolytic therapy or primary angioplasty (25 versus 74 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Not surprisingly, these differences were associated with an increase in in-hospital mortality (23.3 versus 9.3 percent, adjusted odds ratio 2.21, 95 percent confidence interval 2.17 to 2.26).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">ECG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a mainstay in the initial diagnosis of patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS). It allows initial categorization of the patient with a suspected myocardial infarction (MI) into one of three groups based on the pattern:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ST elevation MI (STEMI; ST elevation or new left bundle branch block [LBBB])</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>non-ST elevation ACS, with either non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI) or unstable angina (UA; ST-depression, T wave inversions, or transient ST-elevation)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Undifferentiated chest pain syndrome (nondiagnostic ECG)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">ST elevation MI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with acute STEMI, the ECG evolves through a typical sequence.

Thereafter, the ST segment elevates in the leads recording electrical activity of the involved region of the myocardium; it has the following appearance:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initially, there is elevation of the J point and the ST segment retains its concave configuration</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Over time, the ST segment elevation becomes more pronounced and the ST segment becomes more convex or rounded upward.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ST segment may eventually become indistinguishable from the T wave; the QRS-T complex can actually resemble a monophasic action potential.</p><p/><p>The joint European Society of Cardiology, American College of Cardiology Foundation, the American Heart Association, and the World Heart Federation <span class=\"nowrap\">(ESC/ACCF/AHA/WHF)</span> committee for the definition of MI established specific ECG criteria for the diagnosis of ST elevation MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/6,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,13</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>New ST segment elevation at the J point in two contiguous leads with the cut-points: &gt;0.1 mV in all leads other than leads V2-V3.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For leads V2-V3, the following cut points apply: &ge;0.2 mV in men &ge;40 years, &ge;0.25 mV in men &lt;40 years, or &ge;0.15 mV in women. </p><p/><p>Over time, there is further evolution of these ECG changes; the ST segment gradually returns to the isoelectric baseline, the R wave amplitude becomes markedly reduced, and the Q wave deepens. In addition, the T wave becomes inverted. These changes generally occur within the first two weeks after the event, but may progress more rapidly, within several hours of presentation.</p><p>In addition to patients with ST elevation on the ECG, two other groups of patients with an ACS are considered to have an STEMI: those with new or presumably new LBBB and those with a true posterior MI.

In patients clinically suspected of having an acute MI in whom the ECG is nondiagnostic, it is recommended that the ECG should be repeated at 20- to 30-minute intervals for any patient with ongoing pain in whom the suspicion of ACS remains high.

This value for troponin and CK-MB will vary depending on the assay used. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=troponin-testing-clinical-use\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Troponin testing: Clinical use&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The following discussion will emphasize the diagnostic role of cardiac markers. These markers as well as many other factors are important for risk stratification. These issues for both ST elevation and non-ST elevation MI (STEMI and NSTEMI) are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-stratification-after-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk stratification after acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-stratification-after-non-st-elevation-acute-coronary-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk stratification after non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-adverse-outcomes-after-non-st-elevation-acute-coronary-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for adverse outcomes after non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An elevation in the concentration of troponin or CK-MB is required for the diagnosis of acute MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. If both are measured and the troponin value is normal but the CK-MB is elevated, MB is likely due to release from noncardiac tissue. Follow-up on such individuals reveals that they do extremely well without subsequent events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Troponin is the preferred marker for the diagnosis of myocardial injury for all diagnostic categories because of its increased specificity and better sensitivity compared to CK-MB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/1,2,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,11</a>]. However, an elevation in cardiac troponins must be interpreted in the context of the clinical history and electrocardiogram (ECG) findings since it can be seen in a variety of clinical settings and is therefore not specific for an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The new guidelines endorse the concept that if there are elevations of cardiac troponin (cTn) in a situation where ischemia is not present, the term cardiac injury should be used.

The two discordant groups were treated similarly with antithrombotic agents and percutaneous coronary intervention, so differences in outcomes are less likely to be explained by differences in therapy.
