Of late, knowledge of normal male sexual function and the causes of sexual dysfunction have become better understood, and more effective treatments are available.</p><p>This topic review will provide an overview of normal and abnormal sexual function in men. Male sexual dysfunction includes erectile dysfunction (ED), diminished libido, and abnormal ejaculation. The evaluation and treatment of men with sexual dysfunction and sexual dysfunction associated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-male-sexual-dysfunction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of male sexual dysfunction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-male-sexual-dysfunction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of male sexual dysfunction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-dysfunction-caused-by-selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-ssris-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sexual dysfunction caused by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs): Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2095227\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGY OF MALE SEXUAL FUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normal male sexual function requires interactions among vascular, neurologic, hormonal, and psychological systems. The initial obligatory event required for male sexual activity, the acquisition and maintenance of penile erection, is primarily a vascular phenomenon, triggered by neurologic signals and facilitated only in the presence of an appropriate hormonal milieu and psychological mindset.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2095279\"><span class=\"h2\">Neural influences</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychogenic erections are triggered by neural impulses originating in discrete loci of the central and peripheral nervous systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Sexual images may originate in response to erotic visual or auditory stimuli or be generated via fantasy. The centrally perceived sensual input is relayed by neural signals to a spinal cord neural center located at T-11 to L-2 (the thoracolumbar erection center). From there, neural impulses flow to the pelvic vascular bed, redirecting blood into the corpora cavernosa.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reflex erections are created by tactile stimulus to the penis or genital area which activates a reflex arc with sacral roots originating at S-2 to S-4 (the sacral erection center). Psychogenic erections are more common during man's early sexually active years, whereas reflex erectile activity dominates during his mature years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonsexual, nocturnal erections, occurring three to four times nightly, start in early adolescence. Nocturnal erectile activity may go unnoticed by sleeping men, although most men will be aware of an erection when they arise in the morning. These early morning erections often fade after urination, creating the incorrect impression that they are a reflex response to a full bladder.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Nocturnal erections occur only during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F56491\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56491 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Men who sleep fitfully and depressed men rarely experience REM sleep and do not have nocturnal or early morning erections. Nocturnal erections persist throughout life, although, for as yet unexplained reasons, nocturnal erectile activity is not as tightly coupled to REM sleep in older men.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2095400\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of blood flow and nitric oxide</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normal erections require blood to flow from the hypogastric arterial system into specialized erectile chambers, the paired corpora cavernosa flanking the penile urethra, and the corpus spongiosum at the glans penis. As blood flow accelerates, the pressure within the intracavernosal spaces increases dramatically, preventing penile venous outflow from emissary veins. This combination of increased intracavernosal blood flow and reduced venous outflow allows a man to acquire and maintain a firm erection.</p><p>High levels of intrapenile nitric oxide act as a local neurotransmitter to facilitate the relaxation of intracavernosal trabeculae, thereby maximizing blood flow and penile engorgement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Nitric oxide is formed under the influence of the enzyme nitric oxide synthase, which, in conjunction with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and oxygen, transforms the substrate amino acid arginine to citrulline and nitric oxide.</p><p>The absolute prerequisites for penile erectile activity are an adequate arterial inflow to provide a constant source of intracavernosal oxygen and sufficient nitric oxide synthase to generate nitric oxide. Nitric oxide acts by promoting the generation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP).</p><p>Detumescence (loss of erection) occurs when nitric oxide-induced vasodilation disappears because of metabolism of cyclic GMP, which is primarily mediated by intracavernosal type 5 cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Detumescence also is in part regulated by norepinephrine pathways.</p><p>The role of nitric oxide may have important therapeutic implications for patients with erectile dysfunction (ED). Low intracavernosal nitric oxide synthase levels are found in cigarette smokers and patients with diabetes and testosterone deficiency, which may explain why these factors are associated with a high frequency of ED. On the other hand, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sildenafil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sildenafil</a>, as well as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vardenafil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vardenafil</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tadalafil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tadalafil</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=avanafil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">avanafil</a>, are all phosphodiesterase (PDE-5) inhibitors. All four PDE-5 inhibitors enhance intracavernosal cyclic GMP levels to improve the erectile response to sexual stimulation in many men with ED. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-male-sexual-dysfunction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of male sexual dysfunction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Interference with oxygen delivery or nitric oxide synthesis can prevent intracavernosal blood pressure from rising to a level sufficient to impede venous outflow, leading to an inability to acquire or sustain a rigid erection. Examples include decreased blood flow and inadequate intracavernosal oxygen levels when atherosclerosis involves the hypogastric artery or other feeder vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], and diabetes mellitus, which is associated with suboptimal nitric oxide synthase activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2095523\"><span class=\"h2\">Hormonal influences</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testosterone plays an integral role in normal male sexual function. The onset of adolescent nocturnal erections coincides with the pulsatile release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) activation of Leydig cell testosterone secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Testosterone deficiency results in impotence in experimental animals and men, and sexual potency returns when testosterone levels are normalized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testosterone acts through psychogenic channels to enhance libido.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testosterone is necessary for maintenance of intrapenile nitric oxide synthase levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63447781\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal sexual activity with age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sexual activity is affected by age, health status, and gender. In a population-based survey, men were more likely than women to be sexually active and report a good quality sex life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Gender differences increased with age and were most noticeable in the 75 to 85 year-old group: 39 percent of men versus 17 percent of women were sexually active.</p><p>Men and women in good health were more likely to be sexually active compared to those in fair or poor health. Men lost more years of sexually active life as a result of poor health than women.</p><p>Although men may remain sexually active, there are a number of age-associated changes in sexual function in men including delay in erection, diminished intensity and duration of orgasm, and decreased force of seminal emission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63447488\"><span class=\"h1\">SEXUAL DYSFUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Male sexual dysfunction includes erectile dysfunction (ED), diminished libido, and abnormal ejaculation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63447840\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 1994 survey, the Massachusetts Male Aging Study (MMAS), revealed that male sexual dysfunction, presenting as ED, diminished libido, or abnormal ejaculation, first emerges as a common problem for men in their early 40s and increases with advancing age. At age 40 years, as an example, 40 percent acknowledged some level of impaired sexual function and another 10 percent recognized a waning sexual prowess or interest with each succeeding decade (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F107343\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107343 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. A nine-year longitudinal follow-up study of this same cohort confirmed the age-associated declines in most domains of sexual function: sexual intercourse, erection frequency, sexual desire, satisfaction with sex, and orgasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The high prevalence of sexual problems was confirmed by data derived from the National Health and Social Life Survey [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Even in a cohort of younger men ages 18 to 59 years, 31 percent suffered from sexual dysfunction. In this population-representative national survey, comparably<strong>-</strong>aged women reported a somewhat higher degree of sexual dysfunction (41 percent). The factors responsible for maintaining normal sexual function in the female are less well characterized than in the male. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sexual dysfunction in women: Epidemiology, risk factors, and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The age-associated increase in the prevalence of sexual dysfunction noted in the MMAS was strongly confirmed by a larger cross-sectional analysis of data from a prospective cohort study of 31,742 men ages 53 to 90 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2095582\"><span class=\"h2\">Decreased libido</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of reduced libido is estimated to be 5 to 15 percent in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. It increases with age and it frequently accompanies other sexual disorders. Men with ED may experience loss of libido as a secondary consequence of ED. This usually is ascertained from a detailed sexual history, including the chronology of the disorder. However, most patients who complain of ED do not complain of reduced libido or sexual desire.</p><p>The causes of low libido include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medications (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs], anti-androgens, 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, opioid analgesics)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alcoholism</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depression</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fatigue</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypoactive sexual disorder</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recreational drugs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relationship problems</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other sexual dysfunction (fear of humiliation)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sexual aversion disorder</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic illness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testosterone deficiency</p><p/><p>Most of these conditions are potentially treatable, so it is important to take a good medical history, perform a careful examination, and obtain relevant laboratory studies to determine if any of them are present.

(See <a href=\"#H63447781\" class=\"local\">'Normal sexual activity with age'</a> above.)</p><p>In men, the most common sexual problem is ED. A number of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies suggest a high prevalence of ED in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/12-15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15,17</a>]. A multinational study of 27,839 men in eight countries (United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Mexico, and Brazil) was conducted with the same survey instrument [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The ages ranged from 20 to 75 years, and the overall prevalence of ED was 16 percent. It was 8 percent in men 20 to 30 years of age and 37 percent in men 70 to 75 years of age.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2095608\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In one study, exercise was associated with a lower risk of ED, while obesity, smoking, watching television, and the presence of comorbid conditions were associated with a higher risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The lowest prevalence was noted in men without chronic medical problems who engaged in healthy behaviors. In obese men with ED, weight loss and increased physical activity are associated with an improvement in erectile function in about one-third of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Frequency of sexual activity appears to predict the development of ED. This was illustrated in a five-year longitudinal cohort study of 989 men ages 55 to 75 years, who did not have ED at baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. After adjusting for comorbidities and other major risk factors, men who reported intercourse less than once per week developed ED at twice the rate as men who reported intercourse once per week (79 versus <span class=\"nowrap\">33/1000</span> relative risk [RR] 2.2).</p><p>In a prospective, cohort study of 570 men followed for approximately 25 years, the presence of risk factors for coronary heart disease (smoking, obesity, dyslipidemia) in midlife (mean age 46 years) were associated with incident ED (mean age 72 years at the time of follow-up) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>In addition to age, the best predictors of ED are diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, smoking, and medication use (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F97650\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97650 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/12-14,21-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14,21-26</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H189242047\" class=\"local\">'Drugs'</a> below.)</p><p>Obstructive sleep apnea is a risk factor for ED, independent of other confounders such as obesity and smoking; treatment with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) may improve or preserve sexual function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Restless leg syndrome (RLS) was also identified as an independent risk factor for ED in a prospective study of over 10,000 men (mean age 63 years) followed for six years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The impact of RLS treatment on ED has not yet been investigated. Men who present with sleep disorders should also be questioned about the presence of ED.</p><p>Other diseases associated with ED include systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), Peyronie's disease, and prostate cancer treatment (eg, brachytherapy, prostatectomy) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F97650\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97650 \">table 1</a>).

In one report from a large community diabetes clinic, the prevalence increased from 6 percent in men aged 20 to 24 years to 52 percent in those aged 55 to 59 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In addition to increasing age, the main factors associated with ED were peripheral or autonomic neuropathy, retinopathy, long duration of diabetes, and poor glycemic control.</p><p>In a similar study, the severity of ED severity was positively correlated with diabetes duration, poor glycemic control, diuretic therapy, and presence of microvascular or cardiovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In addition, observational studies suggest that the presence of ED is a predictor of cardiovascular events in men with diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>], as it is for men without diabetes. (See <a href=\"#H189242040\" class=\"local\">'Association with cardiovascular disease'</a> below.)</p><p>Not surprisingly, men with diabetes who develop ED experience a significant decline in quality-of-life measures as well as an increase in depressive symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Conversely, depression is a well-recognized contributor to ED. Unfortunately, ED may go undetected as many clinicians do not inquire about sexual health. As an example, a large epidemiologic survey reported that the majority of men with diabetes and ED had never been asked by their clinicians about their sexual function and, therefore, did not receive treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H189242040\"><span class=\"h3\">Association with cardiovascular disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ED and cardiovascular disease share many risk factors, and their pathophysiology is mediated through endothelial dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-male-sexual-dysfunction/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].

Few of these men typically seek treatment for their condition. The prevalence of premature ejaculation varies among countries and different ethnic groups. For example, the prevalence of PE in Asian countries tends to be higher, while the prevalence in European countries tends to be lower.

Psychological factors such as a history of sexual abuse, impaired self-body image, depression, and performance anxiety may play a role in the development of PE.
