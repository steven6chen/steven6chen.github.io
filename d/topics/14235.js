Factors implicated in the pathogenesis of BPD include prematurity, and inflammation caused by mechanical injury, oxygen toxicity, and infection. Many strategies have been attempted to prevent BPD. Success has been limited, in part, because the etiology of the disorder is multifactorial and multiple interventions are needed.</p><p>Potential strategies to prevent BPD are reviewed here. The pathogenesis, clinical features, management, and prognosis of this disorder are discussed separately.

In particular, trials have consistently confirmed a significant reduction in the frequency of RDS among neonates who received antenatal glucocorticoid therapy resulting in less need for mechanical ventilation and oxygen supplementation, which are risk factors for BPD. Thus, antenatal glucocorticoid therapy should be given to any pregnant woman from 23 to 34 weeks of gestation who is at risk for preterm delivery within the next seven days. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antenatal-corticosteroid-therapy-for-reduction-of-neonatal-respiratory-morbidity-and-mortality-from-preterm-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antenatal corticosteroid therapy for reduction of neonatal respiratory morbidity and mortality from preterm delivery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, antenatal glucocorticoid therapy has not decreased the incidence of BPD because the increased survival rate associated with its use results in more infants at risk for BPD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Postnatal glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The administration of postnatal systemic corticosteroids reduces the rate of BPD at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) and improves short-term lung function in infants with established BPD. However, the potential benefits of systemic glucocorticoids, particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dexamethasone</a>, appear to be outweighed by their known short-term and long-term adverse effects, including cerebral palsy (CP). As a result, we follow the recommendation of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Canadian Paediatric Society (CPS), and do <strong>not</strong> routinely administer postnatal glucocorticoids to very low birth weight (VLBW) infants to prevent or treat BPD. The use of postnatal systemic glucocorticoid therapy to prevent BPD is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postnatal-use-of-corticosteroids-in-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postnatal use of corticosteroids in bronchopulmonary dysplasia&quot;, section on 'Systemic steroids'</a>.)</p><p>There is no evidence that inhaled glucocorticoid prevents BPD in at-risk preterm infants. As a result, we follow the recommendation of the AAP and the CPS, and do <strong>not</strong> administer inhaled glucocorticoids to at-risk preterm infants to prevent BPD.

However, similar to antenatal glucocorticoid therapy, surfactant has not reduced the incidence of BPD because of the increased survival rate of VLBW infants who are at risk for BPD. The use of early surfactant to prevent and treat RDS is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-respiratory-distress-syndrome-in-preterm-infants#H23056094\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants&quot;, section on 'Surfactant therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4198180483\"><span class=\"h3\">Late surfactant therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Late deficiency of postnatal surfactant production or surfactant dysfunction may play a role in the pathogenesis of BPD because it may be associated with episodes of respiratory deterioration in ventilator-dependent preterm infants. However, it appears that late administration of surfactant does not reduce the risk of BPD. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a French trial of 118 very preterm infants (gestational age [GA] &lt;33 weeks) who still required mechanical ventilation on day 14 of life with fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) of more than 0.30, there were no differences in the time to first successful extubation and the secondary outcome of BPD or death at 36 weeks PMA between patients who were randomly assigned to surfactant therapy (200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=poractant-alfa-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">poractant alfa</a>) and those who received placebo (air) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second trial reported trends towards lower oxygen requirements and risk of mortality and BPD in ventilator-dependent infants (birth weight [BW] range 600 to 900 g) treated with surfactant between 3 and 10 days of age compared with those who received placebo but this did not reach statistical significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a third trial, 85 ELBW infants were randomly assigned to receive a pulmonary surfactant protein B (SP-B) containing surfactant plus inhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitric-oxide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">nitric oxide</a> (iNO) compared with iNO alone. Clinical status and recovery of SP-B from tracheal aspirates were transiently improved. However, these effects waned after one day and favorable pulmonary effects were not maintained. Late surfactant administration had minimal acute adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Fluid restriction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Positive fluid balance defined as a lack of postnatal weight loss during the immediate postnatal period has been proposed as a predisposing risk factor for BPD. This hypothesis is supported by a retrospective report of premature infants (BW between 401 and 1000 g) from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Neonatal Research Network study that found infants who either died or developed BPD had a higher fluid intake and a lower weight loss during the first 10 days of life compared with those who survived without BPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>However, small trials of fluid restriction have not shown a consistent effect on the development of BPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In one study, 168 ventilated infants (GA 23 to 33 weeks) were randomly assigned to receive routine fluid volumes (60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> on the first day, progressing to 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> on the seventh day) or 80 percent of routine volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Similar proportions in each group had BPD (26 versus 25 percent) and survived without oxygen treatment at 36 weeks PMA (58 versus 52 percent). However, significantly fewer restricted infants received postnatal corticosteroid treatment (19 versus 43 percent), suggesting that their clinicians may have considered they had less severe disease than controls. In addition, colloid infusion (primarily albumin used to treat low blood pressure) increased the duration of oxygen requirement.</p><p>Fluid restriction may reduce pulmonary edema and potentially minimize lung injury that contributes to BPD. This was suggested by a trial of infants &le;1750 g who were randomly assigned to restricted or routine fluid intake for four weeks after birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. At four weeks, significantly more infants in the restricted group survived without radiographic signs of BPD.</p><p>Modest fluid restriction may also lower the risk of BPD by reducing the likelihood of developing a symptomatic patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), thereby reducing the left-to-right shunting and pulmonary overcirculation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-patent-ductus-arteriosus-in-premature-infants#H10685880\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of patent ductus arteriosus in premature infants&quot;, section on 'Bronchopulmonary dysplasia'</a>.)</p><p>Despite the mixed results regarding the effect of fluid restriction on clinical outcome, it seems prudent to minimize fluid intake as much as possible. This strategy results in avoidance of excessive pulmonary fluid and the development of pulmonary edema or a symptomatic PDA that may contribute to the pathogenesis of BPD.</p><p>There are no data to support the use of diuretic therapy in maintaining a neutral or negative fluid balance. In our practice, diuretic therapy is tried in chronically ventilator-dependent infants with moderate to severe lung function impairment after a trial of fluid restriction (130 to 140 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg)</span> has failed to significantly improve their pulmonary status; the diuretic is continued if improvement is seen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Protective ventilation strategies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mechanical ventilation has been a lifesaving intervention in the care of premature infants with premature lung development. However, mechanical ventilation causes tissue injury and inflammation that contribute to BPD. As a result, the following strategies have been developed as attempts to reduce or avoid the trauma of mechanical ventilation, in the hopes of decreasing BPD. However, the optimal approach for mechanical ventilation to reduce the incidence of BPD remains uncertain.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimal ventilation with permissive hypercapnia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Volume-targeted ventilation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High frequency oscillatory ventilation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early application of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Noninvasive mechanical ventilation</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Minimal ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mechanical ventilation with high tidal volumes results in mechanical injury to the lung, and the use of small tidal volumes may protect the lung from mechanical injury. Because it is difficult to measure delivered tidal volume in preterm infants, neonatal randomized trials comparing low versus high tidal volume ventilation have not been performed. Permissive hypercapnia (defined as partial pressure of carbon dioxide [PaCO<sub>2</sub>] between 50 and 55 mmHg) is used as a clinical surrogate for low tidal volume ventilation in studies of preterm infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and clinical features of bronchopulmonary dysplasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The benefit of minimal ventilation with permissive hypercapnia has not been definitively demonstrated in preterm infants at risk for BPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. In one trial, extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants requiring mechanical ventilation before 12 hours of age were randomly assigned to minimal ventilation (target PaCO<sub>2</sub> &gt;52 mmHg) or routine ventilation (PaCO<sub>2</sub> &lt;48 mmHg), as well as a course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dexamethasone</a> or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The trial was stopped after enrollment of 220 infants because of excess adverse events in infants treated with dexamethasone. Although there was no difference between ventilator groups in the combined primary outcome of death or BPD at 36 weeks PMA, the proportion of infants requiring mechanical ventilation was less in the minimal versus routine ventilation groups (1 versus 16 percent). Major morbidities and long-term outcome were comparable in both treatment groups.</p><p>The lack of difference in the combined outcome of death or BPD between the minimal and routine ventilation groups may be due, in part, to an insufficient sample size. Another reason may be that the PaCO<sub>2</sub> targeted values were not accurate clinical surrogates for low and high tidal volumes between the two groups. PaCO<sub>2</sub> differences between the groups were small. Because ventilated infants continued to breathe spontaneously, the measured PaCO<sub>2</sub> reflected both the selected airway pressure (which determines the tidal volume) and ventilator rate, and the infant's own ventilation. Spontaneous breathing may have resulted in an only modest increase in PaCO<sub>2</sub> in the minimal ventilation group and minimized the difference between groups resulting in the negative result.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Volume-targeted ventilation (VTV)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Volume-targeted techniques for neonatal ventilation include volume controlled ventilation and volume guarantee. Volume guarantee, combined with synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) or <span class=\"nowrap\">assist/control,</span> has been reported to decrease the number of high volume mechanical breaths and the peak inspiratory pressure of triggered ventilator breaths. The impact of VTV strategies in preterm infants requiring mechanical ventilation is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanical-ventilation-in-neonates#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanical ventilation in neonates&quot;, section on 'Volume-targeted ventilation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">High frequency ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV), a technique of rapid ventilation with very small tidal volumes, reduces lung injury in animal models compared with conventional positive pressure ventilation. However, nearly all trials comparing HFOV with conventional ventilation performed in preterm infants since surfactant replacement therapy has been available show no effect on the rate of BPD. Although BPD at 36 weeks PMA was reduced in a meta-analysis of two trials that compare high frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) with conventional ventilation as an initial strategy, there was a concern for more adverse neurologic outcome in the HFJV group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In a crossover trial using HFJV as a rescue strategy in preterm infants with pulmonary interstitial emphysema, analysis based on initial treatment assignment showed no difference in outcomes including BPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Despite the lack of data, a trial of high frequency ventilation, as rescue ventilation to minimize volutrauma, often is used in infants with persistent, severe respiratory failure unresponsive to conventional mechanical ventilation.

Early application of CPAP in preterm infants at risk for or with RDS reduces the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation. The use of CPAP in preterm infants to prevent and treat RDS is discussed separately.

It is an augmentation of CPAP, which superimposes inflations set to a peak pressure delivered through nasal prongs or mask.</p><p>Although initial limited data suggested that infants treated with NIPPV compared with either intubation or conventional ventilation or CPAP had a lower risk of the combined outcome of death and BPD, the evidence was not conclusive, and some of the preliminary studies focused only on short-term results during the postextubation period. However, in a trial comparing NIPPV with nasal CPAP (nCPAP) in 987 infants with BW less than 1000 g and GA less than 30 weeks either prior to intubation during the first seven days or following extubation within 28 days after birth, the rate of survival without BPD at 36 weeks PMA was not different between groups (38.4 versus 36.7 percent, odds ratio [OR] 1.09, 95% CI 0.83-1.43).

Infants who received caffeine compared with controls had a lower incidence of BPD, defined as oxygen treatment at 36 weeks PMA (36 versus 47 percent). The difference in the incidence of BPD was attributed in part to a shorter period (about one week) of positive pressure support in the caffeine-treated patients compared with the controls. Although evaluation of survivors at 18 to 21 months corrected age demonstrated caffeine compared with placebo was associated with a lower incidence of the primary combined outcome of death or neurodevelopmental disability (40.2 versus 46.2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], there was no difference between the two groups in death or survival with severe disability (defined differently than the main trial) at follow-up at five years corrected age (21.1 versus 24.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

At most, it appears that vitamin A supplementation given in optimal circumstances would only result in a modest reduction of BPD. Since the incidence of BPD varies among neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), the decision to use vitamin A supplementation may depend upon a balance of factors, such as the local incidence of BPD, the value of at most a modest decrease in BPD, the need for repeated intramuscular injections, and the availability of medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>A meta-analysis showed systemic supplementation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vitamin A</a> in sufficient quantities to establish normal serum retinol concentrations produced a small reduction in the combined outcome of death and BPD, defined as oxygen requirement at one month of age (relative risk [RR] 0.93, 95% CI 0.88-0.99), or defined as oxygen requirement at 36 weeks PMA (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.77-0.98) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].
