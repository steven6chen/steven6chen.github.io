Reperfusion therapies, including primary percutaneous coronary intervention and fibrinolytic therapy, promptly restore blood flow to ischemic myocardium and limit infarct size. </p><p>Paradoxically, however, the return of blood flow can result in additional cardiac damage and complications; this is referred to as reperfusion injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reperfusion-injury-of-the-heart/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Effective therapies to reduce or prevent reperfusion injury have proven elusive. Despite an improved understanding of the pathophysiology of this process and encouraging preclinical trials of multiple agents, most of the clinical trials to prevent reperfusion injury have been disappointing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reperfusion-injury-of-the-heart/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. Despite these problems, adjunctive therapies to limit reperfusion injury remain an active area of investigation.</p><p>This topic will discuss the pathophysiology and manifestations of reperfusion injury, as well as potential therapeutic strategies. The impact of the initial ischemic insult is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=angina-pectoris-chest-pain-caused-by-myocardial-ischemia#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Angina pectoris: Chest pain caused by myocardial ischemia&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia'</a>.)</p><p>General discussions of the use of reperfusion therapy in acute myocardial infarction are presented separately.

In the absence of reperfusion, and in the absence of an adequate collateral circulation, these injured cells die and scar tissue is formed.</p><p>In the presence of reperfusion, either spontaneous or consequent to reperfusion therapy, ischemic injury is halted but additional injury occurs as the result of reperfusion. Reperfusion injury is characterized by myocardial, vascular, or electrophysiological dysfunction that is induced by the restoration of blood flow to previously ischemic tissue. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When blood flow to cardiac myocytes is disrupted by occlusion of a coronary artery, a series of events is set in motion that results in cellular injury and death (termed acute ischemic injury). These processes are related to energy production and utilization and include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced energy production with a fall in intracellular <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a> triphosphate (ATP) levels</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A transition from aerobic to anaerobic energy utilization</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An accumulation of the products of anaerobic metabolism</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sodium and calcium overload and reduced intracellular pH</p><p/><p>These phenomena lead to dramatic distortions in myocyte physiology and architecture, including mitochondrial and sarcolemmal injury and alterations in intracellular calcium handling. Four important adverse intracellular events are opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, rapid normalization of pH, intracellular calcium overload, and generation of reactive oxygen species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reperfusion-injury-of-the-heart/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].</p><p>Initially, the damage is reversible, and restoration of blood flow during this period will lead to recovery of normal structures and function. However, if ischemia persists for an extended period of time, this damage becomes irreversible and cell death occurs.</p><p>Prior to cell death there is a period during in which the ischemic myocyte is viable but vulnerable to further injury if blood flow is restored (ie, reperfusion injury). Restoration of blood flow is associated with three events that may further injure myocytes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Microvascular obstruction</strong> &mdash; Although reperfusion removes obstruction to flow in the epicardial circulation, distal flow may remain significantly impaired due to (microvascular) obstruction to flow in small arterial vessels; obstruction may be due to:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Embolization of clot or plaque material from the original site of obstruction.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Formation of new thrombus due to intravascular activation of platelets, complement, and circulating leukocytes.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>External compression of the small vessels due to interstitial edema consequent to a leaky endothelium (endothelial damage).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Direct cellular toxicity.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Vasoconstriction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Preservation of the coronary microvasculature is essential to the ultimate recovery of myocardial function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reperfusion-injury-of-the-heart/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Microvascular dysfunction, or the &quot;no reflow&quot; phenomenon, refers to the impairment of resting blood flow within the postischemic vasculature. The clinical significance of microvascular dysfunction lies in its association with worse cardiovascular outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reperfusion-injury-of-the-heart/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=suboptimal-reperfusion-after-primary-percutaneous-coronary-intervention-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Suboptimal reperfusion after primary percutaneous coronary intervention in acute ST elevation myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'No-reflow phenomenon'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Damage due to local factors </strong>&mdash; Red blood cell deposits (hemorrhage) or local inflammation can further damage the microcirculation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Myocardial edema</strong> (intracellular and interstitial) occurs in a bimodal pattern after reperfusion. The first wave occurs soon after reperfusion and abates within days; the second wave that starts days later and is associated with healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reperfusion-injury-of-the-heart/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p/><p>Some of these factors act through mechanisms discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Myocyte hypercontracture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Restoration of blood flow to previously ischemic cells can result in myocyte hypercontracture and resultant contraction band necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reperfusion-injury-of-the-heart/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Factors that contribute to hypercontracture include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased intracellular calcium &ndash; During an ischemic period, intracellular calcium increases due to impaired calcium cycling and sarcolemmal damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reperfusion-injury-of-the-heart/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This process can be exacerbated with reperfusion. The restoration of a normal extracellular pH after reperfusion produces a hydrogen gradient across the cell membrane. The <span class=\"nowrap\">sodium/hydrogen</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(Na/H)</span> exchanger is activated and causes a net influx of sodium into the cytosol. Under normal conditions, the resulting increase in intracellular sodium would be corrected by the <span class=\"nowrap\">sodium/potassium</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(Na/K)</span> ATPase. However, this channel may not function normally after a period of ischemia due to a lack of energy and structural damage. In this setting, the sodium excess causes the <span class=\"nowrap\">sodium/calcium</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(Na/Ca)</span> channel to run in reverse, producing an influx of calcium into the already calcium-overloaded cell.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reoxygenation and re-energization of the myocyte &ndash; Return of blood flow provides oxygen and energy that stimulates myofibrils, and, in the setting of increased calcium, contraction is uncontrolled and excessive.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Restoration of normal acid-base status &ndash; Reduced cytosolic pH during ischemia inhibits myofibrillar contraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reperfusion-injury-of-the-heart/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. With restoration of blood flow, a normal pH is rapidly restored in the extracellular and then the intracellular space, removing the acidic inhibition to contraction.</p><p/><p>Mechanisms by which hypercontracture can result in additional cardiac injury include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reperfusion-injury-of-the-heart/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cytoskeletal elements can be significantly damaged, ultimately resulting in cell death.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myocytes tearing away from the tight intercellular junctions during hypercontracture can cause damage to the sarcolemma of adjacent cells.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Oxygen and other free radicals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Free radicals are produced within minutes of reperfusion and continue to be generated for hours after the restoration of blood flow to ischemic tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reperfusion-injury-of-the-heart/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Superoxide anion (O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypochlorous acid (HOCl)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nitric oxide-derived peroxynitrite</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hydroxyl radical (OH<sup>-</sup>) </p><p/><p>Several mechanisms have been proposed for the development of these free radicals including xanthine oxidase, activated neutrophils, electron leakage from ischemic mitochondrion, catecholamine oxidation, as well as cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase enzymes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reperfusion-injury-of-the-heart/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The relative importance of each of these pathways is not clear, but they are probably interrelated and may potentiate one another.</p><p>Free radicals damage myocytes directly by altering membrane proteins and phospholipids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reperfusion-injury-of-the-heart/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Because these membrane constituents play crucial roles as receptors, enzymes, and ion channels, free radical injury can lead to fatal metabolic and structural derangements. As an example, oxygen radicals injure the sarcolemma and may impair contractile function of the myocyte on this basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reperfusion-injury-of-the-heart/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The role for free radicals as a source of significant myocardial damage is further supported by studies showing that free radical scavengers, such as superoxide dismutase, administered during thrombolytic therapy help preserve myocardial function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reperfusion-injury-of-the-heart/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Finally, reactive oxygen species stimulate leukocyte activation, chemotaxis, and leukocyte-endothelial adherence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reperfusion-injury-of-the-heart/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Reactive oxygen species may trigger the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore.

Once in the extravascular space, leukocytes can release proteases and elastases that destroy the cell membrane and cause cell death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reperfusion-injury-of-the-heart/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. However, the roles of the various inflammatory mediators are complex and incompletely understood. Although they play a role in reperfusion injury, some also appear to have cardioprotective effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reperfusion-injury-of-the-heart/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Platelet activation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Circulating platelets become activated early during reperfusion, and their degree of activation is related to the duration of preceding ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reperfusion-injury-of-the-heart/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Furthermore, the degree of platelet activation was related to the extent of reperfusion injury.

Terminal complement cascade species directly injure the endothelium, rendering it incapable of elaborating vasodilatory compounds such as NO. This perpetuates a cycle of vasoconstriction and reduction in microvascular perfusion, leading to apoptosis not only within the infarct area, but also in the border zone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reperfusion-injury-of-the-heart/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Apoptosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, has a number of features that distinguish it from necrosis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apoptosis can occur in response to limited molecular damage that is otherwise not sufficient to cause a fatal loss of cellular integrity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apoptosis is an energy-dependent process.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apoptosis is an organized sequence of events triggered by specific signals.</p><p/><p>While ischemic damage occurs principally through necrosis, reperfusion injury may also act through apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reperfusion-injury-of-the-heart/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. In a rabbit model, markers of apoptosis found in reperfused tissue were not present in normal tissue or tissue injured solely by ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reperfusion-injury-of-the-heart/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Others have reported the appearance of apoptotic cells in the perinecrotic zone during reperfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reperfusion-injury-of-the-heart/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>] and suggested that understanding the different contributions of necrosis and apoptosis to reperfusion injury may help identify novel treatment strategies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reperfusion-injury-of-the-heart/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>A link between reperfusion and apoptosis is supported by studies demonstrating the role of magnesium-dependent superoxide dismutase and oxygen radical formation in the activation of proapoptotic factors. An apoptosis repressor is capable of inhibiting this process and reducing the extent of myocardial infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reperfusion-injury-of-the-heart/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL CORRELATES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It has been suggested that reperfusion injury accounts for up to 50 percent of the final myocardial damage in the setting of acute myocardial infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reperfusion-injury-of-the-heart/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Clinical manifestations of ischemic reperfusion injury include arrhythmias, microvascular dysfunction, myocardial stunning, and myocyte death.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Arrhythmias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reperfusion-induced arrhythmias are common in patients treated with thrombolytic therapy, primary percutaneous coronary intervention, and cardiac surgery. The arrhythmia that is most commonly associated with reperfusion is an accelerated idioventricular rhythm. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-ventricular-tachycardia-and-ventricular-fibrillation-during-acute-myocardial-infarction#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation during acute myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'Reperfusion arrhythmias'</a>.)</p><p>Reperfusion arrhythmias may be mediated by mitochondrial dysfunction. Following prolonged ischemia, the mitochondrion may not be able to restore or maintain its inner membrane potential, thereby destabilizing the action potential and increasing susceptibility to arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reperfusion-injury-of-the-heart/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p>Ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation can also occur after thrombolytic therapy; however, these arrhythmias are more likely to reflect persistent occlusion and infarction than a reperfused infarct-related artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reperfusion-injury-of-the-heart/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The pathogenesis of reperfusion arrhythmias is discussed extensively elsewhere.

It is thought to result from myocardial oxidative stress and calcium overload that continues after reperfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reperfusion-injury-of-the-heart/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Myocardial stunning is also associated with microvascular injury and better levels of regional and global myocardial function are seen when the microvasculature is structurally intact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reperfusion-injury-of-the-heart/abstract/10,42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,42-44</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-stunned-or-hibernating-myocardium\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of stunned or hibernating myocardium&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Because stunning can recover with time, inotropic agents can be used in the short term to improve cardiac function and organ perfusion. Several agents that may prevent its occurrence are being investigated. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Potential therapies'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Myocyte death</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most concerning consequence of reperfusion injury is myocyte death. If enough myocytes die, there may be manifestations of acute myocardial infarction.

This observation highlights the potential value of therapies that reduce or eliminate reperfusion injury. Despite an improved understanding of the processes associated with reperfusion injury, there is still uncertainty regarding the magnitude and significance of myocyte death associated with reperfusion.</p><p>Prolonged ischemia and subsequent reperfusion induce adverse cytosolic and mitochondrial changes, as discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.) Opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore and irreversible cardiomyocyte hypercontracture precede myocyte death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reperfusion-injury-of-the-heart/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">POTENTIAL THERAPIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the pathophysiology of reperfusion injury lends itself to potential therapeutic strategies, no treatment directed at reperfusion injury has been shown to lead to improvement in clinical outcomes. Potential reasons for the ultimate failure of agents that appeared promising in preclinical trials include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple mechanisms contribute to the consequences of myocardial infarction (MI) and reperfusion injury. Thus, the impact of a therapy targeted to a single component of the pathophysiology may be diluted in clinical practice.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some mechanisms, such as neutrophil stimulation, may be mediators of injury, but also play important roles in the healing process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reperfusion-injury-of-the-heart/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Targeting such mechanisms would have complex and unpredictable implications on outcomes.

As an example, myocardial blush grade has been used as a tool to evaluate myocardial level perfusion, and low blush grades correlate with myocardial dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/reperfusion-injury-of-the-heart/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>].
