A study based upon the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) estimated that 19 percent of men and 9 percent of women will be diagnosed with a kidney stone by the age of 70 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>In a report from the third NHANES, the population prevalence increased from 3.8 percent in the period from 1976 to 1980 to 5.2 percent in the period from 1988 to 1994 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The prevalence increased in men and women, and in whites and blacks. Although one study suggested that the incidence rates since then may have leveled off [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], the 2007 to 2010 NHANES data found a continued increase in prevalence to 8.8 percent in the United States population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Approximately 75 percent of patients with nephrolithiasis form calcium stones, most of which are composed primarily of calcium oxalate or, less often, calcium phosphate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>]. Pure uric acid stones make up less than 10 percent of all stones.</p><p>This topic provides an overview of the pathogenesis and risk factors for calcium nephrolithiasis. The evaluation and management of the patient with kidney stones, prevention of recurrent calcium stones, and related topics are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and acute management of suspected nephrolithiasis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-patient-with-established-nephrolithiasis-and-treatment-if-stone-composition-is-unknown\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult patient with established nephrolithiasis and treatment if stone composition is unknown&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of recurrent calcium stones in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stones are more likely to occur when one or more factors are present that lead sequentially to supersaturation of the urine, the formation of crystals, and their subsequent aggregation into a clinically detectable stone. Even individuals without nephrolithiasis can excrete crystals; however, calcium oxalate stone formers are more likely to have crystalluria than controls, and the presence of crystalluria substantially increases the likelihood of stone formation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F65169%7ENEPH%2F67694\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65169 graphicRef67694 \">picture 1A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>There is substantial debate about where the initiating event for stone formation occurs. In particular, it is unclear how crystals formed in the tubules become a stone in some patients, rather than being washed away by the high rate of urine flow. Emerging data suggest that the initial site of stone formation is the renal medullary interstitium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Calcium phosphate crystals may form in the interstitium, and they eventually get extruded and adhere to the renal papilla, forming the classic Randall's plaque [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate crystals may then deposit on top of this calcium phosphate nidus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In some situations, crystals may aggregate in dilated ducts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a number of metabolic, anatomic, urinary, and dietary factors that predispose to the development of calcium stones (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F78303\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78303 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/4,11-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,11-16</a>]. The frequency with which these different risk factors occur in patients with recurrent stone disease and the role of genetic susceptibility are reviewed at the end of this topic. The importance of individual risk factors varies by age and sex. A discussion of treatment options can be found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of recurrent calcium stones in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The urine pH contributes to the likelihood of formation of certain stones. An acid urine (typical for most individuals) favors uric acid precipitation when the pH is consistently 5.5 or less. Although uric acid crystal formation was previously believed to be a nidus for calcium oxalate stones, this has not been supported by multiple studies. An alkaline urine (as may be seen with urinary tract infections and renal tubular acidosis but also in individuals with higher dietary alkali intake) promotes calcium phosphate stone formation, typically when the pH is 6.5 or higher. Calcium oxalate stones are not pH dependent in the physiologic range. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Hypocitraturia'</a> below.)</p><p>Calcium phosphate and calcium oxalate stones share some risk factors such as low urine volume, high urine calcium, and low urine citrate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, there are also distinct risk factors for each type of stone. As an example, hyperoxaluria is a risk factor for calcium oxalate stones, while higher urine pH is a risk factor for calcium phosphate stones. Because the approach to stone prevention depends upon the composition of the stone, it is essential that every attempt is made to retrieve a passed or removed stone and to send it for analysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypercalciuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An elevated urinary calcium excretion, with or without other risk factors, is observed in up to one-half of idiopathic calcium stone formers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In addition to predisposing to stone disease, hypercalciuria may also cause hematuria in the absence of overt stone formation. It is presumed that the hematuria in this setting results from local tissue damage induced by small crystal aggregates. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and evaluation of hematuria in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Definition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypercalciuria has been variably defined, and each definition has limitations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinary calcium excretion greater than 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (6.24 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/day)</span> in women and greater than 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (7.49 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/day)</span> in men were the traditional definitions. However, there is no clear justification from the perspective of stone formation why a man is allowed to have more calcium in his urine than a woman. The cutpoints used in published research studies and clinical laboratories vary substantially, with some using the same value for both genders, such as greater than 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (4.99 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/day)</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinary calcium excretion greater than 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/kg)</span> per day is another definition. The problem with this definition is that it allows heavier individuals to have more calcium in their urine than lighter individuals. While this may be appropriate from a calcium balance standpoint, it does not make sense for stone formation. Since urine volume does not increase with weight gain, a &quot;normal&quot; urinary calcium excretion in a heavier person would result in a higher concentration of calcium in the urine (and a higher risk).</p><p/><p>An additional problem with both definitions is that the risk of stone formation rises with increasing urinary calcium excretion above 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/day),</span> not at some arbitrary threshold value. This was illustrated in a cross-sectional study of 3350 men and women, of whom 2237 had a history of nephrolithiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Stone disease was determined from biennial questionnaires; medical record review in the later part of the study confirmed the diagnosis in over 90 percent. Although stone composition was unknown in many cases, the demographics of the participants suggested that approximately 80 percent were likely to have had calcium oxalate stones.</p><p>Compared with a 24-hour urinary calcium excretion below 100 mg, the relative risk of being a stone former in older women was 1.52 for a urinary calcium of 150 to 199 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> 1.84 for a urinary calcium of 200 to 249 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (4.99 to 6.23 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/day),</span> and 1.93 for a urinary calcium of 250 to 299 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (6.24 to 7.48 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/day)</span>. The relative risk increased further at clearly hypercalciuric levels: 2.68 and 4.94 at urinary calcium of 300 to 349 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (7.49 to 8.72 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/day)</span> and greater than 350 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (8.73 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/day),</span> respectively. Similar results were found in men and younger women. The relation to risk appears to be continuous. Thus, the use of the term &quot;hypercalciuria&quot; is not ideal, because there is no clear threshold below which the risk is low and above which the risk is high.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Mechanisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Possible reasons for higher urine calcium in calcium stone formers include primary hyperparathyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>] and chronic acidemia. However, most calcium stone formers with higher urine calcium do not have either of these disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nephrolithiasis-in-renal-tubular-acidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nephrolithiasis in renal tubular acidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>High urine calcium excretion without an identifiable cause is often referred to as idiopathic hypercalciuria. Conceptually, it is useful to consider three contributions to higher urinary calcium excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased intestinal absorption (&quot;absorptive hypercalciuria&quot;) in which there is an increase in intestinal calcium absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. However, dietary calcium intake should not be restricted unless it is excessive (&gt; 1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span>. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Calcium'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased bone resorption (&quot;resorptive hypercalciuria&quot;) in which the source of the excess calcium may be bone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased renal losses (&quot;renal hypercalciuria&quot;) in which there is a defect in renal tubular calcium reabsorption.</p><p/><p>The clinical significance of this classification is uncertain. Most individuals with hypercalciuria exhibit more than one abnormality and may change categories over time. Thus, it is not necessary for clinical purposes to perform calcium loading or calcium restriction tests.</p><p>It has been suggested that idiopathic hypercalciuria is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. Reports have suggested gene defects localized to chromosomal areas 9q33.2-q34.2 and 1q23-q24 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>], but others have been unsuccessful in identifying a locus. This may be due to the likely substantial heterogeneity of this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. It is likely that the common form of nephrolithiasis is a complex genetic disorder that is influenced by environmental factors such as dietary intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p>Idiopathic hypercalciuria may be associated with a slightly higher plasma concentration of calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/4,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,31,32</a>], although the values are rarely above the normal range. A nested case-control study found that higher 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D was associated with a higher risk of incident stone formation in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. A high animal protein intake may contribute to both the high calcitriol levels and the tendency to kidney stone formation in this setting. The influence of plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D is uncertain. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Dietary risk factors'</a> below.)</p><p>Higher calcitriol levels can enhance calcium excretion both by increasing intestinal calcium absorption (absorptive hypercalciuria) and by promoting bone resorption (resorptive hypercalciuria) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The latter effect has important clinical implications since lowering calcium intake may not dramatically reduce urine calcium excretion and may result in negative calcium balance, with the lost calcium coming from bone. If prolonged, the negative calcium balance can lead to osteopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/31,35-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,35-38</a>]. This may be particularly important since some untreated patients with hypercalciuria already have diminished bone density, due possibly to increased bone resorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>The factors responsible for the higher calcitriol levels in some patients with idiopathic hypercalciuria are not well understood. It has been proposed that a urinary phosphate leak might be the primary defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], leading to a mild reduction in the plasma phosphate concentration that would then stimulate the synthesis of calcitriol.</p><p>In some patients, the mechanism for the urinary phosphate leak may be mutations in the sodium-hydrogen exchanger regulator factor 1 (NHERF1), which interacts with both renal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-phosphate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium phosphate</a> transporters to facilitate normal phosphate regulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Some evidence for this hypothesis was noted in a study of 94 patients with renal calcium lithiasis or bone demineralization, of whom seven had mutations in NHERF1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. All seven had low maximal reabsorption of phosphate, hypophosphatemia, and increased calcitriol levels. Expression of mutant NHERF1 proteins in kidney cells did not alter basal phosphate uptake; rather, they caused increased cyclic AMP generation by parathyroid hormone, resulting in the inhibition of phosphate transport. Further study is required to better clarify the increased risk of renal stone formation with abnormalities in NHERF1. A role for fibroblast growth factor-23 has also been suggested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. </p><p>Hypophosphatemia also has other effects that can promote stone formation, including increased bone resorption and reduced tubular calcium reabsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. This explanatory mechanism for high calcitriol levels probably applies to only a small number of patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-vitamin-d#H1172644\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of vitamin D&quot;, section on 'Metabolism'</a>.)</p><p>Experimental results in an animal model suggest that hyperresponsiveness of the gene for the vitamin D receptor to low concentrations of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 is one way to induce hypercalciuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In hypercalciuric stone-forming rats, stabilization of vitamin D receptor mRNA resulted in markedly increased levels of both the receptor and receptor-related events in response to minimal concentrations of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. A role for this receptor in humans is suggested by the finding that the genetic locus for the vitamin D receptor has been linked to the occurrence of at least one stone episode in a large cohort of French Canadians, but this has not been confirmed and other studies are needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Hyperoxaluria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of calcium oxalate stone formation increases as urine oxalate excretion increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. It was believed that a small increase in oxalate excretion represented a relatively large percentage change and, therefore, was more likely to promote calcium oxalate precipitation to a greater degree than a similar absolute increase in calcium excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>], but this has been questioned. The reported frequency of hyperoxaluria varies widely depending upon the gender and number of previous stones in the population studied (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F78303\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78303 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The widely used definition of normal urinary oxalate excretion is less than 45 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/day),</span> generally less than 20 percent that of calcium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. However, similar limitations of the chosen &quot;normal&quot; cutpoint also apply to oxalate. In fact, the risk of stone formation begins to increase significantly at urinary oxalate excretion above 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> well within the &quot;normal&quot; range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Thus, the risk of stone formation increases with increasing urine oxalate, even if the value is within the &quot;normal&quot; range.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Mechanisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The relative contribution of endogenous and exogenous oxalate to urine oxalate excretion remains uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/48,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,50</a>]. Although there is general agreement that increasing dietary oxalate increases urinary oxalate excretion, the amount of the increase varies substantially by the type of food (not just the oxalate content of the food); the impact of dietary oxalate on stone risk appears to be relatively small [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/48,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,51</a>], but it likely varies with some individuals more sensitive to dietary oxalate intake.</p><p>Endogenous oxalate is primarily derived from the metabolism of glycine and ascorbic acid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The actual contribution of dietary oxalate to urinary oxalate excretion has been difficult to ascertain, given incomplete information on the oxalate content and bioavailability in many foods. Dietary oxalate may have a more prominent effect in individuals with idiopathic calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis; these individuals seem to have a higher rate of oxalate absorption (and urinary excretion) than control patients given the same standard diet and amount of exogenous oxalate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>The importance of intestinal oxalate absorption is supported by observations regarding the effect of dietary calcium. Dietary calcium can decrease oxalate absorption in the gut by the formation of insoluble calcium oxalate salts in the intestinal lumen. When less calcium is available in the intestinal lumen to bind oxalate, oxalate absorption, and therefore urinary oxalate excretion, increases. Relatively common settings in which this occurs include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With a low-calcium diet, which is generally not recommended for idiopathic calcium stones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]&nbsp;(see <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Calcium'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With increased intestinal calcium absorption as may be seen in hypercalciuria</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Malabsorption syndromes, as with small bowel disease (eg, Crohn's disease), surgical bowel resection or diversion, including jejunoileal bypass for obesity (bariatric surgery), or cystic fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/53-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-60</a>]</p><p/><p>This last situation leads to the malabsorption of fatty acids and bile salts, and is called enteric hyperoxaluria. The increase in oxalate absorption and subsequent excretion is due both to binding of free calcium to fatty acids in the intestinal lumen and to increased colonic permeability to small molecules such as oxalate induced by exposure of the colon to nonabsorbed bile salts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/61-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-63</a>].</p><p>Patients with malabsorption may have additional factors predisposing to stone formation other than increased oxalate excretion (which can be as high as 80 to 200 mg [0.9 to 2.2 mmol] per day) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. The diarrheal fluid losses can lead both to a reduction in urine volume and, if the patient has a metabolic acidosis, a low urine pH and a marked decrease in citrate excretion (see below); these changes can promote uric acid as well as calcium oxalate stone formation.</p><p>Similarly, the rate of hyperoxaluric stone formation is higher in patients who have undergone modern bariatric surgery. In a series of 132 patients with nephrolithiasis who had undergone modern bariatric surgery, the average time to formation of the first stone was 3.6 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Acute kidney injury or chronic kidney disease due to intratubular or interstitial calcium oxalate precipitation also can occur, especially in the setting of volume depletion and decreased urinary flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/4,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,65</a>].</p><p>The magnitude of the increase in oxalate excretion was evaluated in the previously mentioned series of 132 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

Lower intake of fluid, calcium, potassium, and phytate and higher intake of sodium, sucrose, fructose, vitamin C, and possibly animal protein are associated with an increased risk for calcium stone formation. The type of beverage may also influence the risk. The effect of calcium intake is paradoxical, with a decreased risk with increased dietary calcium and an increased or no change in risk with calcium supplements.</p><p>The combination of dietary factors may also have a significant impact upon stone risk. As an example, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet is high in fruits and vegetables, moderate in low-fat dairy products, and low in animal protein.

This was suggested in a report from a cohort of men that also found an association between increased dietary calcium and decreased stone formation in men under the age of 60 years, but not in older men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>].</p><p>A possible explanation for this phenomenon of contrasting risks depending upon the source of calcium is related to the timing of calcium intake, as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dietary sources are ingested with oxalate in foods, binding dietary oxalate in the gut, leading to decreased oxalate absorption and excretion. The fall in oxalate excretion exceeds the rise in calcium excretion; the net effect is a reduction in the relative supersaturation of the urine with respect to calcium oxalate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/140\" class=\"abstract_t\">140</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Calcium supplements are often taken in the morning or before bedtime, and not with meals; thus, they would not be expected to effectively bind dietary oxalate. This would lead to both maintaining oxalate excretion and, by keeping calcium free in the intestinal lumen, increasing calcium absorption and excretion.</p><p/><p>It is also possible that there may be other inhibitory factors in dairy products, which are the major source of dietary calcium (though the risk was also lower with higher dietary calcium intake from nondairy sources) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/142\" class=\"abstract_t\">142</a>].</p><p>Some investigators have attempted to categorize individuals based upon their pattern of calcium absorption and excretion. In patients classified as having absorptive hypercalciuria, dietary calcium restriction reduced urinary calcium. However, since there would not be a concomitant change in urinary oxalate excretion, there would be a lesser reduction in the relative supersaturation of calcium oxalate, unless perhaps dietary oxalate were also restricted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/143\" class=\"abstract_t\">143</a>]. However, evidence is lacking that restriction of dietary calcium reduces the rate of stone formation in these patients, and there is substantial evidence that reducing dietary calcium intake could be harmful; thus, dietary calcium restriction is not recommended.</p><p>An understanding of all of these factors is essential for the appropriate evaluation and treatment of patients with calcium stone disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-patient-with-established-nephrolithiasis-and-treatment-if-stone-composition-is-unknown\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult patient with established nephrolithiasis and treatment if stone composition is unknown&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of recurrent calcium stones in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Oxalate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oxalate is found in many foods, typically in small amounts. Oxalate is also generated from the metabolism of glycine, hydroxyproline and vitamin C (ascorbic acid). Oxalate absorbed from dietary sources or produced from endogenous metabolism is eventually excreted in the urine. There is continued debate regarding the relative contribution of dietary and endogenously derived oxalate on urinary oxalate; it has been estimated that 10 to 50 percent of urinary oxalate is derived from dietary oxalate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Difficulties in measuring the oxalate content of individual foods has previously led to unreliable information. Reliable assays now exist for direct determination of oxalate in foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/48,144,145\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,144,145</a>]. There is currently a list of more than 200 foods analyzed with more modern methods, which can be downloaded from the following web address: <a href=\"https://regepi.bwh.harvard.edu/health/nutrition.html&amp;token=tNBv9GZbg9Tgg0eyEGmf20hEneIDl3YmTrQDjNMJCR31ChhQUCHp82EhBE/DJDbSKKx/am9ijqBlgEelLm1FgQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=7375\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">https://regepi.bwh.harvard.edu/health/nutrition.html</a>. The lack of information on food oxalate content has previously hindered efforts to examine the impact of dietary oxalate on stone formation.</p><p>To examine the relation between stone risk and oxalate intake, a prospective study was performed based upon food frequency questionnaires of three large cohorts: the Health Professionals follow-up study and the Nurse's Health Studies I and II [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. When individuals in the highest quintile for dietary oxalate intake were compared with the lowest quintile, there was a mild increase in the risk of stones for men (RR of 1.22, 95% CI 1.03-1.45) and for older women (RR of 1.21, 95% CI 1.01-1.44). This risk was higher in men with a decreased dietary intake of calcium. In addition, eight or more servings of spinach per month (which accounted for &gt;40 percent of oxalate intake) compared with fewer than one serving per month was associated with a similar increase in stone risk for older men and women. By contrast, dietary oxalate and spinach intake were not associated with an increased risk for younger women. Thus, dietary oxalate intake is only a modest risk factor for incident kidney stones in the general population, but this risk likely varies by individual.</p><p>Dietary intervention studies have also demonstrated that higher oxalate intake increases urinary oxalate and presumably increases the risk of stone formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/146\" class=\"abstract_t\">146</a>]. However, other factors also need to be considered, such as higher intake of calcium and magnesium, which may reduce the absorption of dietary oxalate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/147,148\" class=\"abstract_t\">147,148</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Hyperoxaluria'</a> above.)</p><p>Nevertheless, because the risk of stone formation increases with increasing urinary oxalate, a lower intake of dietary oxalate and vitamin C seems prudent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The challenge remains how to choose a low-oxalate diet without inappropriately restricting intake of fruits and vegetables. Aggressive restriction of dietary oxalate is not practical. Follow-up 24-hour urine oxalate measurements should be used to determine if the dietary oxalate restriction is beneficial; if not, then it should be discontinued.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Potassium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A higher dietary potassium intake was associated with a substantially reduced risk of incident stone formation in men and women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/149\" class=\"abstract_t\">149</a>]. One possible explanation is that higher potassium intake may reduce the risk of stone formation by reducing urinary calcium excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/150\" class=\"abstract_t\">150</a>].</p><p>Another mechanism is that higher potassium intake may increase urinary citrate excretion (since potassium-rich foods tend to have a high alkali content) thereby increasing the inhibitory properties of urine. Foods that are rich in potassium include fruits and vegetables. Although some have recommended a reduction in the intake of certain fruits and vegetables with the hope this would reduce oxalate intake and excretion, other studies found a slight protective effect of fruit ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/91,111\" class=\"abstract_t\">91,111</a>]. Overall, given that dietary potassium is associated with a lower risk and fruits and vegetables are a major source of dietary potassium, it seems that there is evidence to encourage intake of fruits and vegetables (while avoiding those that are very high in oxalate such as spinach, rhubarb, and potatoes).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Sodium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A high sodium intake will enhance the excretion of calcium, a relation that has been thought to be due in part to the reabsorption of calcium passively following that of sodium and water in the proximal tubule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/151\" class=\"abstract_t\">151</a>]. Thus, the decrease in proximal sodium reabsorption induced by volume expansion will lead to a parallel reduction in calcium transport and increased calcium excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/152,153\" class=\"abstract_t\">152,153</a>]. In one study of stone formers with idiopathic hypercalciuria, for example, increasing sodium intake from 80 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/day</span> led to almost a 40 percent rise in calcium excretion (from 278 to 384 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> [or 7 to 9.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/day])</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/152\" class=\"abstract_t\">152</a>]. This increase in calcium excretion may result in negative calcium balance, which would promote the development of osteopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p>A high-sodium diet may also produce an undesirable reduction in citrate excretion via an uncertain mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/153\" class=\"abstract_t\">153</a>]. In addition, the anion accompanying sodium appears to be a determinant of the effect on calcium excretion. In particular, chloride seems to be required for the calciuresis to occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/153\" class=\"abstract_t\">153</a>]. How chloride acts in this setting is not clear.</p><p>The clinical magnitude of these effects on stone formation is not clear. The Nurses' Health Study noted a relative risk of 1.30 for symptomatic stones in women in the highest quintile of sodium intake compared with those in the lowest quintile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. No association was seen in men or younger women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/16,127,128\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,127,128</a>], although the lack of an association may be due to the difficulty in accurately assessing sodium intake by questionnaires. In the study of over 3300 individuals with 24-hour urine collections, urine sodium excretion was not independently associated with likelihood of being a stone former [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], but these analyses were adjusted for calcium and citrate (the potential factors through which sodium may act). In the Women's Health Initiative, the risk of stone formation was 61 percent higher among women in the highest quintile of sodium intake compared with the lowest quintile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/154\" class=\"abstract_t\">154</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Protein</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different types of dietary protein may have different effects on the risk of kidney stones. As an example, a high animal protein intake has been associated with a slightly higher incidence of stone disease, at least in men; by contrast, vegetable protein intake has not been associated with stone risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/16,127,149\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,127,149</a>]. In addition, the risk of stones associated with animal protein intake may vary depending upon whether the source of the animal protein is dairy or nondairy. In one study, higher nondairy animal protein intake was associated with a modest but nonsignificant increase in stone risk, whereas higher dairy protein intake in young women was associated with a lower risk of stone disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/149\" class=\"abstract_t\">149</a>]. </p><p>Higher animal protein intake (both nondairy and dairy) is associated with higher urine calcium excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/106,149,155-157\" class=\"abstract_t\">106,149,155-157</a>]. In addition, higher nondairy animal protein intake is associated with lower urine citrate, whereas higher dairy protein intake is associated with higher urine citrate excretion and lower urine oxalate excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/149\" class=\"abstract_t\">149</a>]. Vegetable protein has a much lesser effect on calcium, uric acid, and citrate excretion since it has a lower sulfur content and therefore generates less acid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/156\" class=\"abstract_t\">156</a>]. </p><p>There are several factors that may explain the higher urine calcium excretion resulting from higher animal protein intake:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long term, a high-protein diet may produce hypercalciuria by increasing renal calcitriol production that may be mediated by an increase in renal mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/158\" class=\"abstract_t\">158</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acid generated from higher animal protein intake (from the metabolism of sulfur-containing amino acids) is buffered in part by bone salts, resulting in the release of calcium from bone and an increase in urinary calcium excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/106,155-157\" class=\"abstract_t\">106,155-157</a>]. However, neutralizing the acid load associated with high-protein diet does <strong>not</strong> ameliorate hypercalciuria. This was shown in a crossover study of 11 healthy adults fed a normal or high-protein diet in combination with either potassium citrate (an alkaline salt) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium chloride</a> (a neutral salt) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/159\" class=\"abstract_t\">159</a>]. Although supplementation with potassium citrate both prevented the fall in urinary citrate excretion associated with the high-protein diet and completely neutralized the acid load, the high-protein diet still produced a significant increase in urinary calcium excretion. </p><p/><p>The reduction in urine citrate excretion associated with higher nondairy animal protein intake may be due to enhanced proximal citrate reabsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/106,155,160\" class=\"abstract_t\">106,155,160</a>]. This effect is induced at least in part by the fall in tubular fluid pH resulting from the acid load. The increased availability of hydrogen ions will convert the trivalent citrate anion into the divalent anion, which is more easily reabsorbed via the sodium-citrate cotransporter in the luminal membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/160\" class=\"abstract_t\">160</a>]. The associated fall in intracellular pH also may contribute by increasing cell citrate utilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/161\" class=\"abstract_t\">161</a>]; the ensuing reduction in cell citrate levels favors passive citrate entry from the tubular lumen into the cell.</p><p>The ratio of nondairy animal protein intake to potassium intake, which estimates dietary net acid load, may also be important to the risk of kidney stones. In one study, a higher animal protein-to-potassium ratio was associated with a higher risk of stone formation, even after adjustment for animal protein and potassium intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/149\" class=\"abstract_t\">149</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Potassium'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Phytate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Higher amounts of dietary phytate may lower the risk of stone formation. In a study of nearly 100,000 younger female participants in the Nurses Health Study II, the adjusted relative risk of stone formation among those in the highest quintile of phytate intake, compared with those in the lowest, was 0.63 (95% CI 0.51-0.78) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/128\" class=\"abstract_t\">128</a>]. Although its mechanism of action is unclear, calcium oxalate crystal formation is strongly inhibited in vitro by phytate. The principal dietary sources of phytate in this population were cold cereal, dark bread, and beans.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H537058803\"><span class=\"h2\">Sucrose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Higher sucrose intake is associated with an increased risk of stone formation in younger and older women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/104,128\" class=\"abstract_t\">104,128</a>]. Nearly 40 years ago, Lemann showed that an oral glucose load increased urine calcium excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/162\" class=\"abstract_t\">162</a>]. Although the mechanism is unknown, higher insulin levels may lead to higher urinary calcium excretion; however, some data are contradictory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/163\" class=\"abstract_t\">163</a>]. Fructose intake should also be minimized, as higher fructose intake is associated with a higher risk of kidney stones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-calcium-stones-in-adults/abstract/164\" class=\"abstract_t\">164</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE OF URINARY RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The degree to which the above risk factors contribute to stone disease varies in different populations.
