Fibroids are abnormal growths of tissue that form in the uterus, the part of the woman's body that holds the baby if she is pregnant.</p><p>UAE is also called &quot;uterine fibroid embolization.&quot; It works by blocking the blood vessels that supply blood to fibroids, causing them to shrink. It is one of several ways doctors treat fibroids.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89192448\"><span class=\"h1\">Why might a woman get UAE?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UAE helps ease the heavy bleeding and lower belly pressure caused by fibroids. Compared with surgery to treat fibroids, UAE:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Takes less time</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does not require any cuts (incisions) in the belly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has a shorter recovery time</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89192463\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the downsides of UAE?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Compared with women treated with surgery, women treated with UAE are more likely to need a second surgery to control heavy bleeding.</p><p>UAE does not work well on certain types of fibroids. Also, women who want to get pregnant in the future should not have UAE. Your doctor can help you decide if UAE is right for you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89192478\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens during UAE?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you are having UAE, you will be treated in a hospital. You will get medicines (called &quot;anesthesia&quot;) to block pain in the lower half of your body and to make you feel relaxed. But you will stay awake.</p><p>The doctor will then insert a thin tube (called a &quot;catheter&quot;) into the artery at the top of one leg and advance it up to your uterus. With the tube in place, the doctor will inject a special dye that can be seen on X-rays to show the arteries that bring blood to the fibroid. Next, the doctor will inject tiny plastic beads into the artery to block the blood flow to the fibroid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F86790\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86790 \">figure 1</a>). Afterward, the doctor will repeat the same steps on the other side. The procedure takes about 1 hour. You will likely stay in the hospital overnight, where nurses can check you and give you pain medicines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89192512\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after UAE?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women have lower belly pain and cramping after the procedure. These symptoms are usually worst the first 2 days after the procedure and can last up to 7 days. Some women have discharge or bleeding from the vagina for 2 weeks after UAE. Sometimes, the bleeding lasts for months.</p><p>Some women also:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feel sick to their stomach (nausea)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Throw up (vomit)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feel tired and achy</p><p/><p>If you have these symptoms, your doctor can prescribe pain relievers and other medicines to treat them.</p><p>You should see your doctor for several follow-up visits during the first year to check that the procedure worked.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89192529\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is possible to get pregnant after UAE. But after UAE, pregnancy might not be safe for either the mother or the baby. Because of this, doctors advise women who want to get pregnant <strong>not</strong> to have this procedure. They also advise women to use birth control after the procedure to avoid pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89192544\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-fibroids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Uterine fibroids (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anesthesia (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-fibroids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Uterine fibroids (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=abnormal-uterine-bleeding-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Abnormal uterine bleeding (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
