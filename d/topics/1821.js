The clinical presentation is highly variable, and some cases lack the characteristic features originally described by Beckwith and Wiedemann [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beckwith-wiedemann-syndrome/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. BWS exhibits etiologic molecular heterogeneity, and some molecular alterations correlate with specific phenotypic features of BWS.</p><p>The epidemiology, genetics, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, management, and prognosis of BWS are reviewed in this topic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1618222\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>BWS is a panethnic disorder with an estimated population prevalence of 1 in 10,300 to 13,700 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beckwith-wiedemann-syndrome/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. This figure most likely represents an underestimate because milder phenotypes may not be ascertained. The prevalence is equal in males and females, with the notable exception of an increased frequency of female monozygotic twins versus male monozygotic twins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beckwith-wiedemann-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. BWS usually occurs sporadically (85 percent), but familial transmission occurs in approximately 15 percent of cases. Assisted reproductive technology (ART) is associated with an increased risk of imprinting disorders, with a 10-fold increased risk of BWS seen in live births from ART compared with natural conception in one Italian study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beckwith-wiedemann-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1618409\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Generally, both the maternally and paternally inherited alleles of each autosomal gene pair are expressed. Less than 100 genes across the genome are imprinted and expressed monoallelically in a parent of origin-specific manner (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F54712\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54712 \">figure 1</a>). That is, for a given imprinted gene pair, one parental allele is exclusively or preferentially expressed, whereas the other allele is silenced or weakly expressed. Genomic imprinting is regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. These include noncoding RNAs and chemical modifications extrinsic to the primary nucleotide sequence, such as DNA methylation and histone protein tail modifications. Different DNA methylation and histone modification states underpin the expression or silencing of imprinted alleles. Thus, imprinted alleles demonstrate differential DNA methylation. Imprinted genes occur in clusters referred to as imprinted domains and are regulated <em>in</em> <em>cis</em> (on the same chromosome) by imprinting centers (ICs). ICs are comprised of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of DNA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inheritance-patterns-of-monogenic-disorders-mendelian-and-non-mendelian#H1457606458\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inheritance patterns of monogenic disorders (Mendelian and non-Mendelian)&quot;, section on 'Parent-of-origin effects (imprinting)'</a>.)</p><p>Deregulation of imprinted gene expression in the chromosome 11p15.5 region can result in the BWS phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beckwith-wiedemann-syndrome/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. The critical BWS genes in that region include insulin-like growth factor 2 (<em>IGF2</em>), <em>H19</em>, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1C (<em>CDKN1C</em>), potassium channel voltage-gated KQT-like subfamily member 1 (<em>KCNQ1</em>), and <em>KCNQ1</em>-overlapping transcript 1 (<em>KCNQ1OT1</em>, or long QT intronic transcript 1). A chromosome 11p15 molecular alteration is identified in only approximately 80 percent of individuals with BWS. This is due, in part, to somatic mosaicism for some of the molecular alterations.</p><p>Genomic loci outside of the chromosome 11p15.5 region have also been implicated in the etiology of BWS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beckwith-wiedemann-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Molecular studies have demonstrated that NLR family pyrin domain containing 2 (<em>NALP2)</em> on chromosome 19 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beckwith-wiedemann-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] can modulate imprinting in the chromosome 11p15.5 region. In addition, an infant with features of BWS was found to have a large chromosome 7 deletion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beckwith-wiedemann-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This deletion included the growth factor receptor-bound protein 10 gene (<em>GRB10</em>), an imprinted gene that inhibits the growth-promoting activities of insulin and insulin-like growth factors 1 and 2 by binding to the receptors for these molecules (insulin receptor and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor). Chromosome 18q deletions were reported in individuals with some features of BWS and developmental delay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beckwith-wiedemann-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Domain 1 of the chromosome 11p15.5 region is the telomeric imprinted domain that contains the imprinted genes <em>H19</em> and <em>IGF2</em>. <em>H19</em> is a nontranslated RNA that may function as a tumor suppressor gene. <em>IGF2</em> is a potent fetal growth factor. <em>IGF2</em> overexpression is considered to be a key determinant in the development of BWS. <em>H19</em> and <em>IGF2</em> are reciprocally expressed imprinted genes, with <em>H19</em> maternally expressed and <em>IGF2</em> paternally expressed. The expression of genes within this domain is regulated by an IC upstream of <em>H19</em> called imprinting center 1 (IC1). IC1 is normally methylated on the paternal allele and unmethylated on the maternal allele. Regulation of transcription is accomplished by binding of the zinc-finger insulator protein CCCTC-binding factor (<em>CTCF</em>) to its consensus sequence within IC1. <em>CTCF</em> only binds to the unmethylated sequence (maternal allele) and modulates the interaction of downstream enhancers interacting with the <em>H19</em> and <em>IGF2</em> promoters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beckwith-wiedemann-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Approximately 20 percent of patients with BWS and isolated IC1 gain of methylation carry single nucleotide variants or microdeletions that affect the octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT4) or sex-determining region Y (SRY)-box 2 (SOX2) transcription factor binding sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beckwith-wiedemann-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Such novel genomic aberrations continue to be described in both imprinted domains on 11p15.5.</p><p>For example, domain 2 is the centromeric imprinted domain that contains the imprinted genes <em>CDKN1C</em>, <em>KCNQ1</em>, and <em>KCNQ1OT1</em>. Regulation of this domain is controlled by an imprinting center, IC2, located in intron 10 of the <em>KCNQ1</em> gene. IC2 is a differentially methylated region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beckwith-wiedemann-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] that contains the promoter for <em>KCNQ1OT1</em>, a noncoding RNA with regulatory function. In BWS, loss of methylation at IC2 results in biallelic expression of the normally paternally expressed <em>KCNQ1OT1</em>. Individuals with BWS and loss of methylation at IC2 have reduced <em>CDKN1C</em> expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beckwith-wiedemann-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In some BWS cases, loss of methylation at IC2 is associated with loss of methylation at multiple imprinted regions across the genome.</p><p>A number of different mechanisms can lead to BWS via epigenetic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> genetic alterations in the chromosome 11p15.5 imprinted domains. These modifications change the relative contributions<strong> </strong>of parental alleles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beckwith-wiedemann-syndrome/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>] and include parent of origin-specific duplications, <span class=\"nowrap\">translocations/inversions,</span> microdeletions, microduplications, DNA methylation changes at IC1 or IC2, and uniparental disomy (UPD). UPD refers to the presence of two chromosomal regions from one parent and none from the other.</p><p>The following molecular alterations can be detected in individuals with BWS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beckwith-wiedemann-syndrome/abstract/10,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,19</a>] (the percentage of cases with each type of alteration is quoted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beckwith-wiedemann-syndrome/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>]):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of methylation at IC2 (50 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paternal UPD 11 (20 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gain of methylation at IC1 (5 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mutation of <em>CDKN1C</em> (5 percent in sporadic cases)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paternal duplication, maternal inversion, or translocation involving the p15.5 band of chromosome 11 (less than 1 percent)</p><p/><p>In some BWS cases, DNA methylation changes are associated with genomic alterations (microdeletions or microduplications); these usually involve IC1 and only rarely IC2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beckwith-wiedemann-syndrome/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>]. Genomic alterations with or without changes in methylation are important because of their heritability. Epigenetic alterations that involve both IC1 and IC2 generally indicate paternal UPD for a chromosomal segment including the 11p15.5 region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beckwith-wiedemann-syndrome/abstract/8,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,20</a>]. Segmental UPD of chromosome 11 is thought to arise from a postzygotic somatic recombination event, and, therefore, a mosaic distribution of this molecular change is found in most cases.</p><p>Rarely, microarray testing undertaken for a clinical reason unrelated to BWS reveals a copy number variation (microdeletion or microduplication) involving 11p15.5. In such situations, a clinical diagnosis of BWS would not be assigned when careful evaluation does not reveal any BWS-associated clinical findings. However, tumor surveillance is suggested given that Wilms tumor has been reported in children with constitutional 11p15.5 molecular alterations in the absence of other BWS clinical features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beckwith-wiedemann-syndrome/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H130269\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hallmark features of BWS include omphalocele (exomphalos), macroglossia, and macrosomia (gigantism) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beckwith-wiedemann-syndrome/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]; however, there is significant clinical heterogeneity.

The phenotype of BWS is highly variable and may include as few as two of the recognized clinical features. Approximately 15 percent of cases of BWS are familial. Thus, targeted information should be elicited regarding family history, including parental features during childhood, since these may normalize over time. In addition, type of conception (ie, natural versus assisted conception) and pregnancy-related findings, such as polyhydramnios, placental mesenchymal dysplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beckwith-wiedemann-syndrome/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], and prematurity, should be ascertained. (See <a href=\"#H130269\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1618222\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p>Notably, children with mild phenotypes (eg, macroglossia and umbilical hernia) are still at increased risk for tumor development. Thus, there should be a high index of suspicion when evaluating children with minimal clinical features in the BWS phenotypic spectrum, particularly if there is a positive family history (one or more family members with a clinical diagnosis of BWS or a history or features suggestive of BWS). In such cases, anticipatory medical management (eg, tumor surveillance) and molecular testing should be considered (see <a href=\"#H22939583\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below). As noted above, tumor surveillance should not be discontinued in the absence of a detectable molecular alteration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1619017\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Methylation-sensitive multiplex ligation probe analysis (MS-MLPA) is the most robust method clinically available for detecting the majority of epigenetic and genetic etiologies associated with BWS.

Somatic mosaicism associated with UPD may lead to weak signals on MS-MLPA. UPD can be confirmed by analysis of short tandem repeats when it is suggested by methylation alterations at both imprinting centers 1 and 2 (IC1 and IC2). In addition, failure to detect a methylation alteration or UPD in one tissue (usually leukocytes) is not conclusive, especially in cases involving hemihyperplasia. Thus, testing of at least two <span class=\"nowrap\">tissues/cell</span> populations, for example leukocytes and skin, should be considered.</p><p>Karyotype analysis is required to detect the rare de novo and maternally transmitted <span class=\"nowrap\">translocations/inversions</span> and will also detect paternally derived duplications of chromosome 11p15.5 associated with BWS. <span class=\"nowrap\">Translocations/inversions</span> almost always disrupt the gene potassium channel voltage-gated KQT-like subfamily member 1 (<em>KCNQ1</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beckwith-wiedemann-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] and<strong> </strong>are not usually detectable by MS-MLPA, because most do not demonstrate DNA copy number changes or DNA methylation changes.</p><p>DNA sequencing is required to detect genomic alterations<strong> </strong>in the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1C (<em>CDKN1C</em>) gene associated with BWS. <em>CDKN1C</em> mutations are seen both sporadically (5 percent of cases) and in autosomal dominant pedigrees modified by preferential parent of origin-specific transmission (40 percent of cases) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beckwith-wiedemann-syndrome/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1887889\"><span class=\"h2\">Prenatal diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Indications for prenatal testing may include a previous child with BWS or a positive family history of BWS. Prenatal testing may be undertaken by chorionic villus sampling (CVS) or amniocentesis, if the cytogenetic or genomic abnormality (eg, microdeletion, <em>CDKN1C</em> mutation) in the affected family member is known. Epigenetic analysis of chromosome 11p15.5 in amniocytes is sufficiently reliable for prenatal diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beckwith-wiedemann-syndrome/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>], with the caution that mosaicism can confound the reliability of the test result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beckwith-wiedemann-syndrome/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Analysis of methylation alterations in CVS requires further validation before this can be offered as a clinical test since methylation status of chromosome 11p15.5 ICs is known to vary significantly in extra-embryonic tissues in early pregnancy.</p><p>Prenatal testing via amniocentesis may also be indicated for BWS-associated findings detected on fetal ultrasound, such as omphalocele, renal enlargement, or macroglossia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beckwith-wiedemann-syndrome/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1618409\" class=\"local\">'Genetics and pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The hallmark features of BWS are omphalocele (exomphalos), macroglossia, and macrosomia (gigantism). However, the clinical presentation is highly variable, and some cases lack these characteristic features. (See <a href=\"#H130269\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of genetic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> epigenetic alterations in growth regulatory genes on chromosome 11p15.5 are associated with specific phenotype-(epi)genotype correlations and different recurrence risks. (See <a href=\"#H1887409\" class=\"local\">'Phenotype-(epi)genotype correlations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No consensus diagnostic criteria exist for BWS, although the presence of a subset of associated findings are used to confer a clinical diagnosis. Molecular testing can then be incorporated to determine the precise genetic defect and confirm the diagnosis. Methylation-sensitive multiplex ligation probe analysis (MS-MLPA) is the most robust method available for detecting the majority of epigenetic and genetic etiologies associated with BWS. Prenatal testing is available. (See <a href=\"#H1619903\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis includes both genetic and nongenetic causes of macrosomia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53324\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53324 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F62919\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62919 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H22939447\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial evaluation includes assessment for hypoglycemia, airway sufficiency, feeding difficulties, and screening for tumors. Surveillance includes monitoring for hypoglycemia, tumors, developmental issues, and renal disease. (See <a href=\"#H22939583\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cases involving uniparental disomy (UPD) arise from postzygotic somatic recombination and are therefore not known to be associated with a significantly increased risk for recurrence. Parental studies are recommended if genomic alterations are found (eg, karyotype abnormalities, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1C [<em>CDKN1C</em>] mutations, or microduplications or microdeletions of the chromosome 11p15.5 region), and these test results are then incorporated into estimates of recurrence risks. (See <a href=\"#H22939618\" class=\"local\">'Genetic counseling'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants with BWS are at increased risk for mortality, mainly due to complications of prematurity, macroglossia, hypoglycemia, tumors, and, rarely, cardiomyopathy. The increased risk for neoplasia is concentrated in the first eight years of life. Thus, prognosis is generally favorable after early childhood. (See <a href=\"#H1351427\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/beckwith-wiedemann-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Weksberg R, Shuman C, Beckwith JB.
