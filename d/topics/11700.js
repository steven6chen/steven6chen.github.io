They help your body fight infections.</p><p>Neutropenia can happen to people being treated for cancer. That's because the medicines used to kill cancer cells or stop them from growing (called &quot;chemotherapy&quot;) impair the body's ability to make all blood cells, including neutrophils.</p><p>People who get neutropenia because of their cancer treatment can get infections easily. In many cases the only sign of these infections is fever. This is called &quot;neutropenic fever&quot; or &quot;febrile neutropenia.&quot; Fever in someone with neutropenia is very serious.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H77442001\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Go to the emergency room right away if you have received chemotherapy within the last 6 weeks (or if you have been told you have neutropenia) and you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a fever of 101.0&deg;F (38.3&deg;C) or higher, taken by oral thermometer, at any time</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a fever of 100.4&deg;F (38.0&deg;C) or higher, taken by oral thermometer, and it lasts for 1 hour or longer</p><p/><p>If you have been told that you have neutropenia or you received chemotherapy less than 6 weeks ago, you should also tell your doctor or nurse if you get any of the following symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chills or sweating</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sore throat, sores in the mouth, or a toothache</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stomach pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the anal area</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain or burning when urinating, or frequent urination</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea or sores around the anus</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cough or shortness of breath</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Redness, swelling, or pain of your skin, especially around a cut, wound, or place where you had a tube in your vein (called an &quot;IV&quot;)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unusual vaginal discharge or itching</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H77442016\"><span class=\"h1\">How is neutropenic fever treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people are treated in the hospital with antibiotics that go into an IV. Some people can instead go home and take antibiotic pills after being seen in the clinic or after having a short stay in the hospital.</p><p>If you have neutropenic fever, it is very important to start antibiotics as soon as possible. Any delay in starting treatment could lead to a widespread infection or even death.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H77442031\"><span class=\"h1\">Can neutropenic fever be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some cases, doctors prescribe antibiotics to people who are at high risk of infection <strong>before</strong> they get a fever. Also, in some cases, doctors can prescribe medicines that help the body make more neutrophils. But these medicines are not appropriate for everyone who is treated for cancer.</p><p>If you are being treated for cancer, the most important thing you can do is to protect yourself from getting an infection in the first place. Here are some things you should do:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash your hands often with soap and water. You can also use alcohol hand rubs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid crowded places and people (especially children) who are sick.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not share food, cups, utensils, or other personal items, such as toothbrushes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shower or bathe every day and use lotion to keep your skin from getting dry and cracked.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cook meat, eggs, and fish all the way through to kill any germs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carefully wash raw fruits and vegetables before eating them.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear gloves when handling waste from dogs, cats, or other pets. Then wash your hands right afterwards.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use gloves to garden, or avoid gardening.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brush your teeth and gums every day with a soft toothbrush. If your doctor or nurse recommends it, use a mouthwash to prevent mouth sores.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep surfaces (such as kitchen counters) in your home clean.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get the flu shot every year.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Don't go outside barefoot.</p><p/><p>Your doctor or nurse might give you other suggestions to help prevent infections, too.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H77442046\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=neutropenia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Neutropenia (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-to-worry-about-a-fever-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: When to worry about a fever in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-loss-of-appetite-and-weight-loss-with-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing loss of appetite and weight loss with cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nausea-and-vomiting-with-cancer-treatment-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nausea and vomiting with cancer treatment (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-your-cancer-treatment-makes-you-tired-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: When your cancer treatment makes you tired (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-pain-when-you-have-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing pain when you have cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hair-loss-from-cancer-treatment-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hair loss from cancer treatment (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
