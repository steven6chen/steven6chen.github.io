Extensive experience with pulmonary metastasectomy in a number of different cancers has confirmed that resection is associated with prolonged relapse-free survival and cure in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-outcomes-by-histology/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Based upon these observations, aggressive resection of isolated pulmonary metastases has become a widely accepted treatment for appropriately selected patients. However, a survival benefit from pulmonary metastasectomy has never been shown in a randomized trial for any histologic subtype, and questions remain as to whether it is the resection or simply the selection of patients with a more favorable natural history that is responsible for the apparent improvement in survival associated with metastasectomy.</p><p>Data from the International Registry of Lung Metastases showed that the survival rates at 5, 10, and 15 years following complete resection in a variety of histologic tumor types were 36, 26, and 22 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-outcomes-by-histology/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The survival rate is influenced by the disease-free interval, number of metastases, and extent of resection. The potential benefits of resection and the approach to the patient are also dependent upon the histology of the tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-outcomes-by-histology/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

These outcomes have been further corroborated by a 2017 analysis of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) database [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-outcomes-by-histology/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Over 25 years, 539 patients underwent 760 metastasectomies of soft tissue sarcoma with curative intent.

Perhaps more importantly, there was a long survival tail to the Kaplan-Meier curve, with 47 percent surviving three years, 34 percent surviving five years, and 23 percent surviving seven years.

The range of overall 5- and 10-year survival rates is 35 to 70 percent and 20 to 30 percent, respectively. In general, these rates are higher than those seen with systemic chemotherapy alone.</p><p>Prognostic factors associated with an improved prognosis following metastasectomy include a limited number of nodules, a normal prethoracotomy carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, the absence of regional lymph node spread, bilaterality, metachronous rather than synchronous presentation, and a longer duration between cancer onset and the development of metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-outcomes-by-histology/abstract/6,10,12,14,15,18,20-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10,12,14,15,18,20-25</a>]. In a series of 378 patients undergoing surgery for pulmonary metastases from colorectal cancer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), recurrence-free survival was 49 percent at three years for those with a single lesion and a disease-free interval of greater than one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-outcomes-by-histology/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

However, outcomes may not be as favorable as compared with those with isolated intrathoracic metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-outcomes-by-histology/abstract/8,10,26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10,26-28</a>]. On the other hand, the presence of liver metastases at initial lung metastasectomy is an adverse prognostic feature in patients who are being considered for repeated lung resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-outcomes-by-histology/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Benefit of postresection adjuvant therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there is no high-quality evidence from clinical trials that prove a survival benefit, patients who have undergone resection of the more common isolated colorectal cancer liver metastases are typically given a six-month course of combination chemotherapy. A modern oxaliplatin-based regimen is usually chosen.

In a combined analysis of both trials (totaling 278 patients), the differences in median progression-free survival in chemotherapy-treated versus non-chemotherapy-treated patients (28 versus 19 months, p = 0.058) and overall survival (62 versus 47 months), while potentially meaningful, were not statistically significant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">While these data provide proof of principle of the benefit of postresection adjuvant chemotherapy in this population (which consisted predominantly of patients with resected liver, rather than lung, metastases), the chemotherapy used in these trials is considered inferior by modern standards.

Adjuvant chemotherapy did not improve overall survival (median 89.6 versus 86.8 months). In this study, the patients with limited metastatic disease had a greater benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy than those patients with evidence of more widely metastatic disease.

However, given the lack of activity of any of these agents in the adjuvant setting after resection of stage II or III colon cancer, most experts would not add a biologic agent to an oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy regimen after resection of pulmonary metastases. In contrast, if patients are treated in the neoadjuvant setting for liver or lung metastases, the addition of a biologic agent is reasonable. One study in patients with colorectal cancer demonstrated significant improvement in both locoregional recurrence-free survival (70 versus 24 months, p = 0.001) and overall survival (101 versus 55 months, p = 0.004) in cases with <em>KRAS </em>mutations (a poor prognostic factor) who were treated with perioperative bevacizumab [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-outcomes-by-histology/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

A chest CT scan should be repeated six weeks after the initial observation of suspected recurrence and prior to repeat surgery, as this may reveal additional deposits of recurrence that may preclude surgery.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-pulmonary-metastases-outcomes-by-histology/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Farrell J.
