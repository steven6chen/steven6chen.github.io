Medical management is focused on alleviating pain and facilitating the spontaneous passage of the stone. However, in some cases, urologic intervention is needed for stone removal for patients with unremitting severe pain that is refractory to analgesic therapy, or in those with obstruction or infection. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Hospitalization versus outpatient management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The acute management of nephrolithiasis depends upon the severity of the pain, and the presence of obstruction or infection. In most patients, outpatient medical management with oral analgesics and hydration is sufficient while awaiting spontaneous passage of the stone. Indications for hospitalization include urinary obstruction, infection, solitary kidney, the need for parenteral fluid and pain medications because of severe pain, or inability to take oral analgesics or fluids (eg, vomiting).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MEDICAL MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21423414\"><span class=\"h2\">Supportive care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Supportive management includes symptomatic treatment and hydration. Data are insufficient to determine if high-volume fluid therapy facilitates stone passage. Nevertheless, until there is more reliable information, in our center, intravenous (IV) hydration is provided at a maintenance rate as quickly as possible given the potential positive impact and limited adverse effect of fluid therapy. Nausea and vomiting should be treated with IV antiemetics. Pain associated with renal colic is best treated with narcotic analgesics combined with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Pain control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and opioid therapy are used to control pain associated with nephrolithiasis. In studies of adult patients, both classes of analgesics are effective in pain relief. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and acute management of suspected nephrolithiasis in adults&quot;, section on 'Pain control'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-agents-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room#H7977256\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic agents for pediatric procedural sedation outside of the operating room&quot;, section on 'Analgesic agents'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selection-of-medications-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room#H2253108\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selection of medications for pediatric procedural sedation outside of the operating room&quot;, section on 'Approach'</a>.)</p><p>At our institution, patients who arrive in the emergency department receive a combination of NSAIDs and IV narcotics as initial management. For patients who are hospitalized, we use IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketorolac-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ketorolac</a> and opioid therapy as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Morphine</a> &minus; For children &gt;6 months of age, IV morphine is given as 0.05 to 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per dose every two to four hours as needed up to a maximum of 2 mg per dose.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketorolac-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Ketorolac</a> &ndash; For children &gt;2 years of age, IV ketorolac is given as 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per dose every six hours with a maximum dose of 30 mg.

If a UTI is suspected, empiric antibiotic therapy is initiated while awaiting culture results. The choice of antibiotic, which can be given orally or parenterally based on the clinical setting, is guided by the likely pathogens and the likelihood of drug resistance. </p><p>Although not commonly seen in children, urosepsis is a serious and life-threatening complication of nephrolithiasis. In the setting of a ureteral stone or obstruction in a child with suspected (eg, fever) or confirmed urosepsis, emergent drainage is necessary using either a ureteral stent of percutaneous nephrostomy tube [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-management-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with a ureteral calculi or urinary obstruction (partial or complete) and suspected UTI are managed with prompt parenteral antibiotic therapy, and urinary decompression and drainage with stenting to lower the intrarenal pelvic pressure due to stone-induced obstruction. This is followed by staged calculi removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-management-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In our institution, children with obstruction are initially treated empirically with IV <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ceftriaxone</a> pending urine culture results based on the likely pathogens and their resistance pattern observed in our locale, which is then modified or discontinued based on urine culture results.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a non-obstructing renal calculus and suspected UTI, empiric antibiotic therapy is provided pending urine culture results. Clearance of UTIs with only antibiotic therapy is difficult in patients with symptomatic stones, therefore these patients need close interval follow-up with a urological surgeon. In cases where there is not resolution infection or subsequent obstruction, surgical removal of the stone is warranted.</p><p/><p>Antibiotic therapy for UTI is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-in-infants-older-than-one-month-and-young-children-acute-management-imaging-and-prognosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract infections in infants older than one month and young children: Acute management, imaging, and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Antibiotic therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Ureteral stone passage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of ureteral stones &lt;5 mm in diameter will pass spontaneously, even in small children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-management-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Follow-up imaging should be performed after a two- to four-week period of observation to confirm stone passage. In children, ultrasonography and a single kidney-ureter-bladder (KUB) radiograph (if the stone is radiopaque) are generally used to monitor stone passage. Although computed tomography (CT) is the most sensitive imaging modality in the detection of renal or urinary tract stones, it is more costly and is associated with higher radiation exposure. As a result, CT is reserved for children with a nondiagnostic ultrasound <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> KUB and a continued high index of suspicion for nephrolithiasis. In addition, CT is sometimes needed to determine true stone burden and exact stone location for surgical management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of nephrolithiasis in children&quot;, section on 'Imaging'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3114154989\"><span class=\"h3\">Medical expulsive therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In adults, several medical interventions have been used to increase the passage rate of ureteral stones, including antispasmodic agents, calcium channel blockers, and alpha blockers. Collectively, these treatments are known as &quot;medical expulsive therapy.&quot; Although data are limited, a systematic review of the literature including four small randomized trials and cohort studies reported that medical expulsive therapy is an effective and safe intervention for ureteral stone passage in children with nephrolithiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-management-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, these results need to be confirmed with larger randomized control trials especially as the use of medical expulsive therapy remains controversial in adults. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-acute-management-of-suspected-nephrolithiasis-in-adults#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and acute management of suspected nephrolithiasis in adults&quot;, section on 'Facilitating stone passage'</a>.)</p><p>In our practice, we have used alpha blockers to facilitate stone passage in children with ureteral stones. Although the US Food and Drug Administration has not approved the use of alpha blockers in children, based on the above data, we will use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamsulosin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">tamsulosin</a> in children older than two years of age with symptomatic ureterovesical stones. We use a dose of 0.2 mg of tamsulosin for children between two to four years of age, and 0.4 mg of tamsulosin for children who are five years and older. Tamsulosin is given as a single dose in the evening before bedtime. Tamsulosin comes only in capsule form. It can be broken and placed onto foods such as yogurt or applesauce for children who cannot swallow pills. One should be cautious in children with enteric feeding tubes as administering this medication can result in clogging the lumen of these tubes.</p><p>These medications have been well-tolerated, and we have not seen orthostatic hypotension, even though this is a potential side effect of alpha blockers. Nevertheless, these agents should be used under the supervision of a clinician experienced in medical expulsive therapy. </p><p>If there has been no spontaneous passage by two to four weeks, we will intervene surgically. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Urologic intervention'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4287746116\"><span class=\"h3\">Uric acid stones</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with uric acid stones, urine alkalinization increases the solubility of uric acid and may result in a decrease in stone size with subsequent passage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-recurrent-nephrolithiasis-in-children#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of recurrent nephrolithiasis in children&quot;, section on 'Hyperuricosuria'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Stone retrieval</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <span class=\"nowrap\">family/patient</span> should be instructed to strain the child's urine for several days, in order to retrieve the stone. If the stone or any fragment is recovered, it should be sent for stone analysis. The known composition of the stone can guide further evaluation and preventive measures to prevent recurrent stones. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-recurrent-nephrolithiasis-in-children#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of recurrent nephrolithiasis in children&quot;, section on 'Evaluation for underlying risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>Urinary strainers are available from medical supply companies. If a urinary strainer cannot be obtained, a receptacle covered by a cheese cloth or fine mesh sheet can be used. A fish net used for home aquariums is also a good alternative.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3129574731\"><span class=\"h2\">Follow-up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For children who have spontaneously passed a ureteral calculus, confirmation of a successfully passed calculus is important. This should include resolution of symptoms and either a documented &quot;stone in hand&quot; that can be analyzed or imaging that confirms passage of the calculus and resolution of associated hydronephrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-management-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. At our institution, ultrasound is the preferred imaging modality for follow-up unless the patient has brought a passed stone into clinic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">UROLOGIC INTERVENTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the high spontaneous stone passage rates for smaller calculi, as well as the cost and potential complications from urologic procedures in children, it is generally accepted that an observation period with adequate pain control should be given. The optimal length of time for observation prior to urologic intervention remains uncertain; however, in our practice, an observation period of up to two weeks is usually employed. </p><p>The goal of management is to minimize renal injury, which requires balancing the risk of a urologic procedure (ie, urinary drainage or stone removal) versus potential chronic renal injury from continued obstruction, and to provide symptomatic relief of pain. </p><p>In our practice, indications for surgical intervention are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical removal without trial of medical management &ndash; Indications for surgical intervention <strong>without</strong> a trial of medical observation include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Urinary obstruction &ndash; Complete obstruction from renal calculi can result in renal parenchymal injury and a decrease in renal function especially if there is evidence of renal insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-management-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Intervention in patients with mild renal insufficiency demonstrates both an initial improvement in renal function due to the relief of the obstruction and subsequent improvement thought to be due to recovery of injured renal tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-management-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Without relief, persistent obstruction can result in permanent scarring and loss of renal tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-management-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">We also consider urologic intervention for patients with partial obstruction of a solitary kidney. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Urinary tract infection &ndash; Urinary tract infection in the setting of a partial or completely obstructing ureteral calculus is an indication for decompression. Those patients with non-obstructing calculi, while not requiring urgent intervention, should have close interval follow-up with a urologic surgeon. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Management of urinary tract infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Struvite stones (magnesium ammonium phosphate and calcium carbonate-apatite) are often associated with an underling UTI, and tend to branch and enlarge resulting in a filling of the renal calyces producing a &quot;staghorn&quot; appearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F62009\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62009 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F72669\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72669 \">image 2</a>). Urologic removal of struvite calculi is generally required to eradicate the underlying infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-management-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Persistent infection, usually due to a urease-producing bacteria (eg, Proteus or Klebsiella), is a risk factor for recurrent stone formation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-nephrolithiasis-in-children#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of and risk factors for nephrolithiasis in children&quot;, section on 'Infection'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-struvite-stones\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of struvite stones&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of struvite or staghorn calculi&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic stones with unremitting severe pain &ndash; Severe pain despite adequate analgesia is most often due to a uretero-vesical (UVJ) or uretero-pelvic junction (UPJ) stone, which is usually accompanied by obstruction. In these patients, pain is relieved with a temporizing ureteral stent and subsequent stone removal, regardless of the size of the stone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic stones that fail to pass after a trial of conservative therapy &ndash; Surgical intervention is performed if there is no improvement after a trial of medical therapy for two to four weeks for symptomatic patients without an underlying UTI and for those successfully managed with oral analgesics that do not impair daily activities who have evidence of radiographically-confirmed obstruction or who have mild proximal urinary tract dilation.</p><p/><p>We offer urologic intervention to asymptomatic children with stones that do not spontaneously pass after two to four weeks of medical therapy and observation. Asymptomatic calculi within the kidney, which usually do not pass spontaneously, can also be treated in order to prevent future symptom development. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Over the past two decades, the following urologic procedures for stone removal have been adapted and developed for use in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-management-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. These procedures have generally replaced open surgical stone removal and can be used in children of all ages, including small children and infants. However, the experience and comfort of the surgeon as well as the equipment available should be considered in the decision of which intervention to use. Many of these interventions are limited by the size of the instruments available. Our group has used each of the three modalities below to treat children including infants, but other medical centers may be constrained by their pediatric-sized resources.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (SWL)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Percutaneous nephrostolithotomy (PCNL), including miniature PCNL</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ureteroscopy</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (SWL) employs high-energy shock waves produced by an electrical discharge. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4224005030\"><span class=\"h4\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SWL has been shown to be an effective and safe procedure for removing stones that are less than 20 mm in diameter in children, including small children and infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-management-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/10,11,14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,14-18</a>]. The efficacy of SWL is dependent on the size and location of the stone. SWL is most effective without subsequent obstruction when the stones are less than 10 mm in diameter and are located in the ureter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-management-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/10,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,19</a>].</p><p>This was best illustrated in a large case series of 344 Turkish children (age range 6 months to 14 years) treated with SWL over a 12-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-management-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The following findings were noted at three-month follow-up:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stone-free rates were 92, 68, and 50 percent for stones with diameters smaller than 10 mm, between 10 and 20 mm, and greater than 20 mm in diameter, respectively. The overall stone-free rate was 73 percent, although repeat treatments were considered in stone clearance rates.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stone-free rates were greater than 90 percent for ureteral and bladder stones regardless of their size. The overall stone-free rate for calyceal stones was 56 percent. A higher rate of 63 percent was associated with small stones less than 1 cm and a lower rate of 40 percent with stones with diameters equal to or greater than 1 cm in diameter. SWL was more likely to fail when stones were located in the lower versus upper pole calyx.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications were observed in 10 percent of cases (n = 33). Steinstrasse (obstruction by stone fragments) occurred in 13 of 167 children treated for renal pelvic stones. Of the 13 patients with obstruction, nine had stones greater than 2 cm, and 4 had stones between 1 and 2 cm in diameter. Other complications included stenting for hydronephrosis and UTIs. There were no episodes of perirenal hematoma or bruising.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2946107111\"><span class=\"h4\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Historically, SWL was performed with the patient placed in a water bath. Shock waves were transmitted through the water and directly focused onto the stone with the aid of biplanar fluoroscopy. Second and third generation lithotriptors do not require the water bath, but utilize a contained fluid interface with the patient to transmit the shock waves. The change in tissue density between the soft renal tissue and the hard stone causes a release of energy at the stone surface, which fragments the stone. However, later-generation lithotriptors are associated with lower efficacy and increased need for retreatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-management-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p>Proper positioning of the child and appropriate power and frequency of the shock waves to the size of the patient are required to reduce the likelihood of complications such as hematomas or lung contusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-management-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In addition, general anesthesia is required so that the patient remains still during the procedure preventing the risk of movement due to the minimal skin sensation, which an awake child would perceive at the entrance site of the shock wave. The shock waves are delivered in a synchronized manner with the electrocardiogram (gated). However, in a small clinical trial using ungated SWL, slowing the shock wave rate from 120 to 80 waves per minute improved stone clearance in children with stones that were less than 20 mm in diameter after one session [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-management-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. But, the time of general anesthesia was longer in the group of patients who received SWL using a slower wave frequency. Further research in larger cohort studies is needed to determine the optimal delivery and rate of shock waves for lithotripsy in children.</p><p>Although a stone-free status is the preferred outcome after SWL, some patients will have residual fragments after the procedure. In some cases, these fragments (usually less than 4 mm in diameter) will pass without symptoms, sometimes taking several months to clear. However, in other cases, residual fragments may grow in size and be associated with an increased risk of recurrent symptomatic episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-management-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-significance-of-residual-stone-fragments-following-stone-removal\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical significance of residual stone fragments following stone removal&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For stones that are less than 20 mm in diameter, the resulting fragments are usually passed without difficulty; however, retreatment may be necessary. Stents are typically used when the stone is greater than 20 mm to reduce the risk of obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-management-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Percutaneous nephrostolithotomy (PCNL) entails obtaining percutaneous access to the collecting system, dilating the tract with serial Amplatz or Alken dilators or balloon dilators, and extracting the stone with grasping forceps or fragmenting the stone with a laser, ultrasonic, pneumatic, hydraulic, or combined lithotripsy probe.</p><p>Stone-free rates of 70 to 90 percent have been reported. Rates vary depending upon the experience of the clinician, the complexity of the stones, and the presence of an underlying structural abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-management-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/12,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,31,32</a>]. In one retrospective Egyptian study of children with renal stones between 1 and 2 cm in diameter, the stone-free rates between a single PCNL and one SWL session were comparable (87 versus 85 percent) at a mean follow-up of 31 months (range 6 to 84 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-management-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>In children, data on complication rates are limited.

One study using 9mTc-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) renal scans reported no evidence of postoperative scarring after PCNL or impairment of glomerular filtration rate when evaluated six months after the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-management-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4086170899\"><span class=\"h4\">Miniature PCNL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An important advancement in percutaneous instrumentation is the introduction of smaller nephroscopes and ultrasonic lithotripsy probes used in performing miniature (or mini) PCNL. Mini-PCNL is performed in a percutaneous tract less than 24F, typically using an 11 to 15F nephroscope. Limited data from case series of preschool children demonstrated better results using mini-PCNL of stone-free rates for moderately sized calculi (10 to 20 mm) using mini-PCNL of 84 to 94 percent compared with the use of ureteroscopy and SWL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-management-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Ureteroscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ureteroscopic instrumentation has been adapted for use in pediatric patients of all ages as a first-line therapy, along with SWL, for calculi &lt;20 mm in diameter. It may also be an option, potentially as staged therapy for the management of children with calculi greater than 20 mm in diameter, especially in those children for whom PCNL is not considered feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-management-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. Once the stone is visualized, it is extracted with grasping forceps or basket, or fragmented with laser, ultrasonic, or electrohydraulic lithotripsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=options-in-the-management-of-renal-and-ureteral-stones-in-adults#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Options in the management of renal and ureteral stones in adults&quot;, section on 'Ureteroscopy'</a>.)</p><p>Although data are limited regarding stone-free rates in children, a systematic review of the literature reported stone-free rates around 90 percent in children with a mean age of 7.8 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-management-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In this review, the mean stone size was 9.8 mm and the majority of the stones were in the ureter (83 percent). The success rate was lower in children less than six years of age. For preschool children with moderately sized calculi (10 to 20 mm), a prospective study of 60 children (mean age 2.4 years) reported a higher stone-free rates at three-month follow-up for ureteroscopy versus SWL (87 versus 70 percent). </p><p>Ureteroscopy is not as successful in the removal of staghorn calculi. This was illustrated in a case series of 19 children with 23 renal calculi that demonstrated clearance of renal pelvic stones in six of eight children (mean number of sessions 1.5), successful clearance of stones in all four children with polar stones after multiple sessions, and clearance in only one of seven children with staghorn calculi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-management-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. These results suggest that ureteroscopy does not have a role in treating children with staghorn calculi. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-struvite-or-staghorn-calculi\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of struvite or staghorn calculi&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Stenting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The need for stenting in children who undergo SWL or ureteroscopy is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-management-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Stents are used to prevent ureteric obstruction either from edema due to ureteral injury or residual fragments in SWL. Studies in adults have demonstrated that patients with stents versus those without stents were more likely to have lower urinary tract symptoms (dysuria, frequency, or urgency), while there was no difference in stone-free rate, and the rates of UTIs, ureteric structures, and analgesic administration. Similar data in children are lacking. In practice, most pediatric urologists do not place a stent in simple, uncomplicated cases of ureteroscopy or in a patient with a stone less than 15 to 20 mm in diameter who is treated with SWL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-management-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>However, pre-stenting (the practice of placing a stent a week or two prior to the ureteroscopic procedure to facilitate ease of passage of the ureteroscopes) has been employed for passive dilation of the ureter. This does place the child at a higher risk for lower urinary tract symptoms and possible infection, but minimizes the need for ureteral dilation at the time of ureteroscopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3949952289\"><span class=\"h3\">Open surgical repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Open surgical repair is rarely, if ever, performed today and is reserved for children who have failed other urologic procedures or those with complex renal or ureteral anatomic abnormalities. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Choice of treatment is dictated by the experience of the clinician and the availability of instrumentation adapted for pediatric cases. In centers where the different procedures are available, treatment choices are based upon the stone size and location, presence of an anatomical abnormality, and, if known, stone composition as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-management-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/12,21,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,21,38,39</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Size of stone:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For stones less than 10 mm, SWL and ureteroscopic lithotripsy have similar efficacy with reported stone-free rates of up to 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-management-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/10,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,35</a>]. The stone location, age of the patient, and expertise of the urologist and availability of appropriate-size instrumentation clinical center are the major factors in decision-making between the two procedures. PCNL is rarely indicated in removal of these smaller stones, unless they are located within an inaccessible calyx, such as with infundibular stenosis or a calyceal diverticulum.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients with stones between 10 and 20 mm in diameter, it is uncertain what the best urologic procedure is. As discussed above, SWL and ureteroscopy appear to offer similar outcomes within this size range for older children. For preschool children, limited data suggest mini-PCNL is associated with a better stone-free rates for moderately sized calculi with minimal complications. The choice of the procedure is based on clinician preference and availability of appropriate equipment for the child, and the preference of the patient and family. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with stones greater than 20 mm in diameter in the kidney, PCNL is the preferred modality for successful stone removal because of the low stone-free rates and difficulty of high stone burden passage produced by SWL. SWL is also an option but with a likely need for repeat intervention. In some cases, depending on patient preference or need to minimize surgical risk of PCNL, ureteroscopy is selected for patients with large stone burdens, although there is often a need for staged second-procedure to ensure stone clearance. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Location &ndash; Several pediatric case series have observed poorer clearance of renal stone fragments from the lower pole compared with other locations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-management-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/10,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,40</a>]. For patients with lower pole stones, ureteroscopy is the preferred intervention. In addition, distal ureteral calculi are more effectively removed with ureteroscopy than with SWL, the decreased efficacy of SWL in the distal ureter may be due to the presence of the bony pelvis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-management-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Ureteroscopy is also associated with a lower radiation risk to the pelvic area, since SWL typically uses fluoroscopy for guidance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Structural abnormality &ndash; Children with underlying structural abnormalities, such as ureteropelvic (UPJ) obstruction and calyceal diverticulum, are at increased risk for developing renal stones. In addition, the underlying anatomical defect prevents effective passage of stone fragments with SWL. PCNL, URO, or laparoscopic or robotic-assisted excision may be considered for calyceal diverticulum. In our center, we prefer PCNL, especially for posterior-located diverticulae, and in children with UPJ obstruction, either PCNL or ureteroscopy is used for stone removal. Additionally, calyceal diverticular stones may be accessed from a laparoscopic approach with an incision being made over the dilated stone-laden calyx and directly extracting the stones. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Composition of stone &ndash; Stones of harder composition, such as cystine and calcium oxalate monohydrate stones, are less amenable to fractionating with SWL and repeat sessions are often needed. As an example, in patients with cystine stones, the stone-free success rate is only 50 percent with SWL, even after four sessions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-management-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. As a result, PCNL or ureteroscopy, and laser lithotripsy are the preferred procedure for patients with these types of stones. In contrast, struvite, calcium oxalate dihydrate, and uric acid stones break more readily with SWL and have a high stone-free success rate with SWL, although ultrasound guidance would be necessary for uric acid calculi, which are radiolucent on fluoroscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-management-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age &ndash; Smaller children may have higher failure and complication rates with ureteroscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-management-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Furthermore, many of these children are at risk for multiple procedures and therefore multiple exposure to general anesthesia, especially if pre-stenting is performed. For this reason, SWL may be preferred to ureteroscopy in children younger than five for similarly sized calculi, especially when the location is in the renal pelvis or proximal ureter.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Recommended approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In institutions where different treatment options are available, therapy can be individualized based upon the factors discussed in the previous section as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-management-of-nephrolithiasis-in-children/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with stones up to 20 mm in diameter, SWL or ureteroscopy with lithotripsy are both reasonable options for stone removal.
