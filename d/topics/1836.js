They are found all over the world. Bedbugs can live in hotels, houses, and other places where people rest and sleep. They can live in your mattress, your clothes, the walls, and other parts of your house. Most often, they bite you while you are sleeping or resting.</p><p>If you have bedbugs in your home, you might not be able to see them. They are very small and hide during the day.</p><p>Bedbugs do not spread diseases in people.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H46118754\"><span class=\"h1\">What do bedbug bites look like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bedbug bites are small, red and swollen areas of the skin that are often (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F116152\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef116152 \">picture 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a row or a line</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On parts of the body not usually covered by clothes, such as the face, neck, arms, and hands</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Very itchy</p><p/><p>Most people don't feel it when they get bitten. They might notice the bites in the morning or after a day or 2. Bedbug bites can take 3 to 6 weeks to heal. They can get infected if you scratch them a lot.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H46118761\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test to tell if I have bedbug bites?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. There is no test. But your doctor or nurse might suspect that your bites are from bedbugs when he or she looks at your skin. Other types of bugs and some diseases can also cause red bumps on the skin that look like bedbug bites.</p><p>The only way to know for sure if you have bedbugs in your home is to catch one. Your doctor or nurse can then inspect the insect. They can tell if it is a bedbug or another type of bug.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H46118768\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to help my bites feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To help your bites feel better and heal faster, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keep the skin clean and dry</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Try not to scratch the bites</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use an anti-itch lotion or cream to help with the itching</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H46118775\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse right away if the bites:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get redder</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get more swollen</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Start having pus come out of them</p><p/><p>If any of these things happen, your bites might be infected. Your doctor or nurse might prescribe medicine for the infection.</p><p>When you first find out you have bedbugs in your home, you might feel very worried or upset. If you feel this way, talk to your doctor about what you can do.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H46118782\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I do about the bedbugs in my home?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You will need to get rid of the bedbugs in your home so you do not get any more bites. To start, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vacuum your home</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash your clothes and bedding, and dry them in a dryer that is on the hottest setting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clean up your home</p><p/><p>Then, you or your landlord should call a pest control service. The workers might use a chemical in your home to get rid of the bedbugs. You should not try to use any chemicals yourself. Another way that pest control services can get rid of bedbugs is a special type of heat treatment. This raises the temperature in your home, which kills the bedbugs.</p><p>If you want to get rid of some of your clothes or things, do not give them to other people. The bedbugs could still be in them. You do not want to spread bedbugs to other people.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H46118789\"><span class=\"h1\">Can bedbug bites be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The only way to prevent bites is by getting rid of the bedbugs. Also, do not sleep or stay over in a place that you know has bedbugs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H46118894\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bedbugs-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Bedbugs (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
