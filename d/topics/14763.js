Cutaneous adverse effects of radiation therapy can be divided into <span class=\"nowrap\">early/acute</span> reactions, occurring within 90 days of initiating treatment, and late effects, which often become apparent months to years after radiation treatment has been completed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F89672\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89672 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>Acute injury, which occurs within hours to weeks after radiation exposure, results from immediate structural tissue damage, generation of short-lived free radicals, irreversible double-stranded breaks in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, and initiation of an inflammatory response in the epidermis and dermis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-dermatitis/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Repeated exposure to low-dose ionizing radiation does not allow time for cells to repair DNA or tissue damage. The accumulation of radiation-induced changes to dermal vasculature, appendageal structures, and epidermal stem cells results in the progression of radiation dermatitis through characteristic stages of severity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F89673\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89673 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>Radiation dermatitis has a profound impact on the quality of a patient's life, due to pain and discomfort. In addition, it may be the cause of premature interruption of radiation therapy, resulting in inadequate disease treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-dermatitis/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. </p><p>This topic will discuss the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and treatment of radiation dermatitis.

The reason for the higher incidence in these cancer patient populations is due to a higher radiation dose to the skin. In most cases, the skin reaction is mild or moderate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F89702\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89702 \">table 2</a>). Approximately 20 to 25 percent of patients experience moist desquamation and ulceration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-dermatitis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3645416\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk factors for radiation dermatitis, including radiation recall, are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F89701\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89701 \">table 3</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3440232152\"><span class=\"h3\">Patient-related</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different areas of the body have different sensitivities to radiation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F89701\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89701 \">table 3</a>). The most sensitive regions of the body are the anterior of the neck, extremities, chest, abdomen, and face [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-dermatitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Hair follicles on the scalp as well as the breast tissue also are radiosensitive. In addition, breast reconstructions and implants are associated with increased risk of severe radiation dermatitis due to the skin's inability to dissipate heat after reconstruction. These reactions are usually confined to surfaces of transposed flaps or to mastectomy flaps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-dermatitis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. </p><p>Other patient-related risk factors include comorbidities (eg, diseases associated with defective DNA repair capacity), obesity, advanced age, female sex, chronic sun exposure, and smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-dermatitis/abstract/2-4,8,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4,8,16</a>]. Based upon limited evidence from case reports and small case series, patients with connective tissue diseases, and in particular those with scleroderma, were considered in the past to be at increased risk of severe acute and chronic radiation dermatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-dermatitis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. However, data from large case series and a few case-control studies do not show an increased frequency of acute or late complications in patients with connective tissue diseases undergoing radiation therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-dermatitis/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. Skin thickening localized to the field of irradiation has been reported to occur in approximately 50 percent of patients with scleroderma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-dermatitis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Among patients with early breast cancer undergoing adjuvant radiation therapy, evidence from observational studies and randomized trials indicates that hypofractionated radiotherapy (40 to 42.5 Gy given in three to four weeks) is associated with a lower risk of acute toxic effects compared with conventionally fractionated radiotherapy (50 Gy in 25 fractions) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-dermatitis/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a multicenter, cohort study including 2309 breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant radiotherapy, the frequency of moist desquamation, dry desquamation, and grade &ge;2 dermatitis was significantly lower among patients treated with hypofractionated radiation therapy compared with those treated with conventional radiation therapy (6.6 versus 28.5 percent, 18.7 versus 58.8 percent, and 27.4 versus 62.6 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-dermatitis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar results were obtained in a randomized trial including 287 breast cancer patients treated with hypofractionated or conventional radiation therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-dermatitis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In this study, the rate of grade &ge;2 dermatitis was 47 percent among patients treated with hypofractionated radiation therapy and 78 percent among those treated with conventional radiotherapy. </p><p/><p>However, possible delayed acute cutaneous toxic effects of hypofractionated radiotherapy occurring after completion of treatment were not systematically ascertained in these studies.

During radiation therapy, the first fractionated dose of radiation causes immediate structural tissue damage, ionization of cellular water and generation of short-lived free radicals, irreversible double-stranded breaks in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, and inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-dermatitis/abstract/2,27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,27-29</a>]. The destruction of a large proportion of basal keratinocytes results in the disruption of the self-renewing property of the epidermis. Repeated exposures do not allow time for cells to repair tissue or DNA damage.</p><p>The mechanism of radiation-induced inflammation is incompletely understood. Ionizing radiation incites signaling between the epidermis and dermis through resident skin cells. The hallmark of radiation-induced skin injury is the transendothelial migration of leukocytes and other immune cells from circulation to irradiated skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-dermatitis/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Keratinocytes, Langerhans cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells in the skin stimulate resident and circulating immune cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-dermatitis/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Numerous cytokines and chemokines are produced in response to these activation signals, which act on the endothelial cells of local vessels, causing the upregulation of adhesion molecules (intercellular adhesion molecule 1 [ICAM1], vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 [VCAM1], E-selectin) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-dermatitis/abstract/30,31,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31,33</a>]. Acute radiation skin toxicity has been correlated with increased formation of various cytokines and chemokines, in particular interleukin (IL)-1-alpha, IL-1-beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, chemokine ligand (CCL)4, cysteine-X-cysteine motif chemokine ligand (CXCL)10, and CCL2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-dermatitis/abstract/30,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,34,35</a>]. In addition, ionizing radiation induces degranulation of mast cells in the dermis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-dermatitis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Research suggests that fibroblasts are a key cell type responsible for the <span class=\"nowrap\">late/delayed</span> effect of radiation (ie, fibrosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-dermatitis/abstract/3,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,31,32</a>]. </p><p>Radiation skin injury also involves imbalances in antioxidant status and redox control of wound healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-dermatitis/abstract/29-32,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-32,36</a>]. Specific enzymes that have been implicated in oxidative stress following radiation exposures include superoxide dismutases, glutathione peroxidases, thioredoxins, heme-oxygenases, heat shock protein-27 (HSP27), and nitric oxide synthase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-dermatitis/abstract/29,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,36</a>]. A Th2-mediated immune response may also be responsible for nonresolution of inflammatory response and delayed wound healing following irradiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-dermatitis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1385063909\"><span class=\"h2\">Late effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, whose levels are increased within hours of radiation exposure, is thought to be implicated in the late radiation-induced fibrotic changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-dermatitis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

Key elements of history are the duration of treatment and the cumulative dose of radiation.

The papillary dermis may show a variable lymphocytic infiltrate with histiocytes around the papillary dermal plexus but no eosinophils, in contrast to fixed drug reactions. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H999313658\"><span class=\"h1\">LATE-STAGE (CHRONIC) RADIATION DERMATITIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1469014882\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Late-stage or chronic radiation dermatitis typically presents months to years after radiation exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiation-dermatitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].
