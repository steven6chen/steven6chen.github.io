These abscesses are found most commonly in reproductive age women and typically result from upper genital tract infection. </p><p>TOA is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition. Aggressive medical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surgical therapy is required and rupture of an abscess may result in sepsis. Prior to the advent of broad-spectrum antibiotics and modern surgical practice, the mortality rate associated with TOA was approximately 50 percent or higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-complications-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. </p><p>The mortality rate approaches zero for abscesses that are not ruptured. For patients with ruptured abscesses, current mortality rates have not been reported, but data from the 1960s suggest the rate may be as high as 1.7 to 3.7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-complications-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/2,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,5</a>]. </p><p>Treatment modalities for TOA include intensive antibiotic therapy, minimally-invasive drainage procedures, invasive surgery, or a combination of these interventions. The large majority of small abscesses (&lt;9 cm in diameter) resolves with antibiotic therapy alone. </p><p>The management of tubo-ovarian abscesses is reviewed here. The epidemiology, diagnosis and evaluation of tubo-ovarian abscesses are discussed separately. Other manifestations of pelvic inflammatory disease are discussed separately.

Clinical findings suggestive of intraabdominal rupture include, but are not limited to, hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea, acute peritoneal signs, or acidosis. Even in the absence of evidence of abscess rupture, surgical exploration and treatment are advisable in any woman with overt signs of sepsis and a large abscess. In our experience, most women who are acutely ill will not improve without surgical removal of the nidus of infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess#H26295331\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of tubo-ovarian abscess&quot;, section on 'Ruptured abscess'</a>.)</p><p>In women who are treated surgically, antibiotics should also be started as soon as possible, either before or during the urgent operative intervention. Importantly, in an unstable patient with the presumptive diagnosis of abscess rupture, surgery should not be delayed for the administration of antibiotics. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18590491\"><span class=\"h2\">Candidates for antibiotic therapy alone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women are candidates for medical management, which allows the avoidance of surgery. Antimicrobial agents alone are effective in approximately 70 percent of all cases, based upon data from large case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-complications-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/6-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-13</a>]. We suggest antibiotic therapy alone for women with the following characteristics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodynamically stable with no signs of a ruptured TOA (acute abdomen, sepsis)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abscess &lt;9 cm in diameter &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adequate response to antibiotic therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Premenopausal (see <a href=\"#H4862349\" class=\"local\">'Postmenopausal women'</a> below)</p><p/><p>Women who are immunosuppressed should be treated in the same manner as other patients; there are no data to support early surgical intervention in this patient population. Some data suggest that women with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are more likely to have a complicated clinical course. However, treatment efficacy using the available approaches appears to be similar among HIV-infected and non-HIV-infected women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-complications-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. As an example, studies of TOA or PID alone in women with human immunodeficiency infection do not suggest a benefit of early surgical treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-treatment#H413500\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Treatment&quot;, section on 'HIV-infected patients'</a>.)</p><p>Abscess size is predictive of treatment success with antibiotics alone, and of length of hospital stay. Observational studies have found that patients with abscesses measuring 9 cm in diameter or larger on imaging appear to have a much higher likelihood of requiring surgical therapy compared to those with smaller masses (60 percent versus approximately 30 to 40 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-complications-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/8,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,16</a>]. </p><p>It is reasonable, however, to initiate antibiotic therapy alone in some patients with large abscesses (&ge;9 cm). This is mainly a consideration for patients who have reasons to avoid surgery (eg, a history of pelvic surgery that suggests the presence of pelvic adhesions or desire to preserve fertility) and otherwise appear clinically stable. In these cases, the patient should be counseled about the increased risk that antimicrobial therapy will fail and that surgery will be required, as well as the risk of a worsening clinical condition while on antibiotics alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-complications-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In our practice, we evaluate these patients on a case-by-case basis and consider them candidates for antibiotics alone if there are no other indications for surgical intervention (eg, suspicion of abscess rupture, lack of response to antimicrobial therapy). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18590499\"><span class=\"h3\">Women who fail antibiotic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After 48 to 72 hours of treatment with antibiotics alone, patients with TOA who do not respond or worsen require either minimally invasive abscess drainage or surgery (either open or laparoscopic). Antibiotic therapy should be continued concurrent with other treatments (see <a href=\"#H4862126\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring therapy'</a> below). The criteria used to determine failure of treatment are: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>New onset or persistent fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent or worsening abdominopelvic tenderness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enlarging pelvic mass</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>New onset, persistent, or further elevation of the white blood cell count</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs of sepsis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-classification-etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-shock-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, classification, etiology, and pathophysiology of shock in adults&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p>We repeat imaging studies approximately every three days and then less frequently if there is consistent clinical improvement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess#H6972017\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of tubo-ovarian abscess&quot;, section on 'Imaging studies'</a>.)</p><p>Minimally-invasive imaging-guided drainage procedures appear to be appropriate for patients who do not worsen, but fail to clearly improve on antibiotics alone. No studies have directly compared surgical intervention with minimally invasive drainage procedures in this clinical scenario. The largest clinical series evaluating failure of antibiotics for TOA used surgical intervention as the reference standard. </p><p>Given the lack of clear clinical data, in our institution, we generally move promptly to surgery when the patient is clearly clinically worsening using the clinical parameters listed above. In addition, surgical intervention is required in patients who are not improving on antimicrobial therapy and in whom minimally invasive drainage is not feasible (eg, mass is multiloculated or difficult to access or a physician experienced in these procedures is not available) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-complications-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H26297689\" class=\"local\">'Minimally-invasive drainage procedures'</a> below.)</p><p>Antibiotics remain a cornerstone of therapy before, during, and after any abscess drainage procedure, regardless of the approach taken.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11150478\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of sexual partners</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women with TOA who test positive for sexually transmitted infection, sexual partners should be notified of the need for evaluation and treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-treatment#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Sex partners'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26297647\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment for tubo-ovarian abscess (TOA). In some women, antimicrobial therapy must be combined with a minimally invasive drainage procedure or surgery. </p><p>The availability of broad-spectrum antibiotics with excellent antimicrobial activity and abscess cavity penetration has revolutionized the primary treatment of nonruptured TOAs. The advent of these antimicrobial agents reversed the dictum prior to the 1970s that all abscesses required drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-complications-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/6,7,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,12,13</a>]. Until that time, given the limited efficacy of nonsurgical options, the treatment of TOA had been surgical extirpation of all involved organs (commonly a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy [TAH-BSO]). However, the associated surgical morbidity, sterilization, and premature menopause were less than satisfactory for many patients. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26297661\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Experts agree that women with a TOA should be treated as an inpatient with intravenous antibiotics, at least initially. This is consistent with the recommendation by the United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-complications-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H26297682\" class=\"local\">'Duration of therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Antibiotic therapy is effective alone in approximately 70 percent of women, as noted above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-complications-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/6-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-13</a>]. This therapeutic approach is limited by the characteristics of abscesses (eg, relatively avascular, not easily permeated by antimicrobials, low pH). Successful treatment of TOAs with antimicrobial therapy alone may in part be attributable to the rich ovarian blood supply. </p><p>Antibiotic therapy for TOA is similar to treatment for pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Although TOA and PID are related conditions caused by similar pathogens, their pathophysiology is not identical. For PID (and for many with TOA), first-line therapy typically uses a second generation cephalosporin with anti-anaerobic activity and it is still inconclusive whether additional anti-anaerobic coverage is needed above and beyond the second-generation cephalosporin. For this reason, the CDC guidelines for treatment of PID advise only selected use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-treatment#H1025421\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Role for anaerobic coverage'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26297668\"><span class=\"h3\">Antibiotic regimens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All regimens share the common characteristics of broad coverage for all associated bacteria (similar to treatment regimens for PID), including coverage for the sexually-transmitted pathogens (<em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> and <em>C. trachomatis</em>, although these bacteria are rarely isolated from a TOA), as well as anaerobes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-complications-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/6,10-13,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10-13,19</a>]. Regimens that include drugs with demonstrated superior abscess wall penetration and activity within the cavity (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefoxitin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefoxitin</a>) are often incorporated into the treatment regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-complications-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess#H2672691\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of tubo-ovarian abscess&quot;, section on 'Microbiology'</a>.)</p><p>If sexually transmitted pathogens are isolated from women with TOA, clinicians should ensure that pathogen-specific therapy is included in the treatment regimen. &#160;</p><p>Various antibiotic regimens have been found to be effective for the medical management of TOA. The majority of clinical data support the use of the first choice regimens listed in the table (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefoxitin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefoxitin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotetan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotetan</a>, plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a>) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F82240\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82240 \">table 1</a>). Data from head-to-head comparisons of the first choice agents have shown nearly equivalent efficacy for the different regimens (approximately 70 percent, and include patients with different size abscesses) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-complications-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/7,8,11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,11,13</a>]. </p><p>Concern had been raised about potential resistance of bowel flora to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotetan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotetan</a>, or to the closely related agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefoxitin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefoxitin</a>. Bowel flora are often involved in the TOA pathogenesis. This concern is based upon findings from a randomized trial that found that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ertapenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ertapenem</a> was significantly more effective than cefotetan at preventing surgical site infection in patients undergoing elective bowel surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-complications-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, there is no evidence of drug-resistant pathogens impacting treatment of TOA. In addition, recent guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America on management of intraabdominal infection suggest cefoxitin as a reasonable choice for cases with mild-moderate severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-complications-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Thus, cefotetan and cefoxitin remain first line agents for treatment of TOA. </p><p>In addition to the standard regimens listed and suggested for use (due to years of data and successful use in clinical practice) in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F82240\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82240 \">table 1</a>), newer agents that likely also have a role in the treatment of TOAs, based on more limited investigation and known spectrum of action against pathogens causing serious intra-abdominal infections, include: <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ertapenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ertapenem</a> (1 gm IV every 24 hours) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piperacillin-and-tazobactam-sodium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piperacillin-tazobactam</a> (3.375 gm IV every 6 hours) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-complications-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. &#160; <br/></p><p>Among the first choice agents, some data suggest that triple therapy is more effective than double therapy. A small series of patients with TOA reported that the treatment success rate was higher with triple therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a>/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a></span> compared with two dual agent regimens <span class=\"nowrap\">(clindamycin/gentamicin</span> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotetan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefotetan</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a>)</span> (88 versus 47 or 34 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-complications-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Although this study did suggest higher efficacy among women who received triple therapy, the small study size and noncomparative nature of the investigation suggest that further study is required before definitive conclusions can be made about superiority of regimens. </p><p>The presence of drug hypersensitivities, as well as risk factors for aminoglycoside toxicity (eg, renal insufficiency), are also relevant considerations when choosing a regimen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergy-evaluation-for-immediate-penicillin-allergy-skin-test-based-diagnostic-strategies-and-cross-reactivity-with-other-beta-lactam-antibiotics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergy evaluation for immediate penicillin allergy: Skin test-based diagnostic strategies and cross-reactivity with other beta-lactam antibiotics&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aminoglycosides#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aminoglycosides&quot;, section on 'Toxicity'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26297675\"><span class=\"h4\">Actinomyces or rare pathogens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical experience suggests that pathogen-directed therapy should be included in the regimen in cases of TOA in which <em>Actinomyces israelii</em> is isolated.

When the standard regimen is complete, we continue treatment with penicillin for at least one additional month. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Doxycycline</a> may be used for patients with a penicillin allergy. There are no high quality data regarding duration of therapy for this pathogen; most experts suggest three to six months of penicillin treatment.</p><p>Scattered case reports highlight the potential for an occasional unusual pathogen to be isolated from a TOA, eg, Candida spp., Pasteurella multocida, salmonellae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-complications-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. These cases should be managed on a case-by-case basis, as these are not the usual endogenous genital tract flora found in the overwhelming majority of TOAs. Consultation with an expert in infectious diseases may be appropriate in such cases.

Most experts recommend continuation of antibiotic therapy until the abscess has resolved on follow-up imaging studies. This can sometimes require four to six weeks of total antibiotic therapy. In cases in which the patient is improving on antibiotics alone, but the abscess has not completely resolved, longer courses of outpatient antibiotics may be given. Cases that do not resolve with routine therapy are best managed in collaboration with an expert in infectious diseases. </p><p>No data are available to formally guide length of therapy when imaging-guided drainage procedures <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> extirpative surgery are used in combination with antimicrobial therapy. In our experience, 10 to 14 days of total antibiotic therapy is usually effective. The overall clinical scenario of each individual patient must also be taken into consideration in these decisions.</p><p>Finishing the course of therapy with oral antibiotics as an outpatient is reasonable in select patients. Ideal candidates for outpatient therapy should meet the following criteria: demonstrate clear clinical improvement, tolerate oral medications, and be able to comply with follow-up communication and appointments.

Procedures that are guided by either computed tomography or ultrasonography have been used and a 70 to 100 percent success rate for adequate TOA drainage has been reported in case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-complications-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/17,18,30-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18,30-36</a>]. As an example, a retrospective study of image-guided drainage procedures in 49 women with TOAs reported successful treatment without subsequent need for surgery in 74 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-complications-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In addition, a separate small, retrospective investigation suggests that early drainage of collections via percutaneous methods plus antibiotics may result in higher efficacy and shorter overall treatment duration when compared to antibiotics alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-complications-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Definitive conclusions await controlled study.</p><p>Studies have used varied anatomic approaches, including percutaneous, transvaginal, transrectal, and transgluteal. The approach and imaging modality used vary depending upon the exact location of the abscess, available technology, and experience of the physician performing the procedure. In all settings, any fluid that is aspirated should be sent to the microbiology laboratory for aerobic and anaerobic cultures. </p><p>In general, studies have reported higher success rates (defined as clinical improvement without the need for surgery) for smaller, unilocular fluid collections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-complications-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Thus, the multilocular nature of many complex TOA collections may lessen the success rate in clinical practice. Nevertheless, this innovative approach can be highly successful and will continue to grow in popularity and efficacy as more radiologists acquire the necessary skills to perform these procedures and as the radiologic technology continues to improve. </p><p>Prior to the availability of modern imaging-guided drainage procedures, gynecologists drained pelvic abscesses transvaginally through a posterior colpotomy. This procedure is most appropriate for post-hysterectomy vaginal cuff abscesses that are in the lower pelvis and dissect to the rectovaginal septum. However, the usual location of a TOA is more superior in the pelvis and makes this a less viable drainage approach. Reports have also highlighted occasional onset of peritonitis and sepsis after use of this approach for a TOA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-complications-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Thus, in most women with TOA, this approach should be avoided.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26297696\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Suspected intraabdominal rupture of a TOA is a life-threatening emergency and requires prompt surgical intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-complications-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Surgical treatment is combined with antimicrobial therapy in such cases. Other indications for surgical intervention are reviewed above. (See <a href=\"#H18590354\" class=\"local\">'Choosing a management approach'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26297703\"><span class=\"h3\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laparotomy is the surgical route used by most gynecologic surgeons for treatment of TOA. The decision of which incision to employ is important, given the need for complete pelvic visualization. We often use either a Maylard transverse or vertical midline incision, given the improved exposure afforded by these incisions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=incisions-for-open-abdominal-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Incisions for open abdominal surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some data suggest that a laparoscopic approach can be used successfully, primarily among patients with no evidence of a ruptured abscess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-complications-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/4,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,40</a>]. In addition, a small case series has suggested improved outcomes while using a laparoscopic approach (compared with laparotomy), but definitive data are lacking. The choice between laparoscopy and laparotomy depends greatly upon the skill of the surgeon. Even in patients without evidence of rupture, a laparoscopic approach should be undertaken only by an experienced laparoscopic surgeon. Surgical treatment of TOA is often a complex procedure, given the extensive, common involvement of varied intraabdominal organs, and inflamed nature of the involved tissues. </p><p>The importance of involvement of experienced gynecologic surgeons cannot be overstated. Regardless of an open or laparoscopic approach, surgical cases involving TOAs are notoriously challenging, given the anatomical distortion and friable tissue planes that universally exist from the extensive inflammatory process. It is not uncommon to also require the assistance of a surgeon experienced with bowel surgery. Appropriate preoperative arrangements assuring availability of operators possessing these skills are prudent. When the clinical scenario allows, preoperative bowel preparation is encouraged. </p><p>The steps of surgical procedure for TOA are the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confirm the diagnosis of TOA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60914\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60914 \">picture 1</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remove as much of the abscess cavity and associated <span class=\"nowrap\">infectious/inflammatory</span> fluid and debris as possible</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Copiously irrigate the peritoneal cavity, thereby lessening the overall <span class=\"nowrap\">infectious/inflammatory</span> burden to the patient.</p><p/><p>Anaerobic and aerobic cultures should be obtained from the peritoneal cavity upon entry and of the fluid in the abscess cavity itself. Tissue specimen cultures collected and sent from the abscess cavity can likewise provide accurate microbiologic information. All removed tissues should be sent for pathologic evaluation. It is important to note that TOAs are sometimes associated with malignancy, particularly in postmenopausal women. (See <a href=\"#H4862349\" class=\"local\">'Postmenopausal women'</a> below.)</p><p>The traditional approach had been to perform a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (TAH-BSO) to remove all infected tissue. While in some situations this is still the optimal approach, further investigations have validated unilateral adnexectomy alone as an accepted and appropriate management for unilateral TOAs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-complications-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/2,7,9,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7,9,12</a>]. This more conservative procedure not only has the added benefit of preserving fertility and hormonal function, but also is technically less involved with generally lower overall surgical morbidity. Thus, we suggest a conservative approach in most women, particularly in those who are premenopausal and who wish to preserve fertility. </p><p>In patients who are acutely ill and who have completed child-bearing, complete extirpative surgery (TAH-BSO) is often the procedure of choice. In our experience, this more aggressive approach hastens complete recovery compared with less extensive surgical approaches. In addition, this eliminates the possibility of repeat surgery that is required in 10 to 20 percent of women who undergo more conservative surgical interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-complications-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/2,7,9,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7,9,12</a>]. Consultation with clinicians experienced with the management of complicated cases of TOA is often helpful, if possible.</p><p>Given the high rates of wound infection from contamination of the surgical field (&ldquo;dirty wound&rdquo;) generated from abscess cavity disruption, we often use the following measures, when appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-complications-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/2,3,6,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,6,12,13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Close the fascia with monofilament non-absorbable or delayed absorbable suture, leaving the skin and subcutaneous wound open for at least the early postoperative period (72 hours). The wound can then be managed with a delayed closure procedure or can heal by secondary intention. Many gynecologic surgeons will opt for primary skin closure in such patients, and this may also be a reasonable option for women with extensive TOA surgery, although no direct evidence suggests the superiority of either approach.

TOA in a woman with an IUD is often associated with a specific anaerobic pathogen, <em>Actinomyces israelii</em>. The World Health Organization advises that an IUD may be left in place during treatment for pelvic inflammatory disease, but this approach has not been validated for women with a TOA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-complications-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. There are no data regarding whether removal of the IUD facilitates treatment in women with TOA in the presence of actinomyces or other organisms. However, since actinomyces preferentially grow on foreign bodies and since women with TOA have a severe infection, in our practice, we remove the IUD for women with TOA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess#H2672691\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of tubo-ovarian abscess&quot;, section on 'Microbiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrauterine-contraception-management-of-side-effects-and-complications#H2660797382\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrauterine contraception: Management of side effects and complications&quot;, section on 'Infection and/or pelvic inflammatory disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4862349\"><span class=\"h2\">Postmenopausal women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the majority of TOAs appear to be diagnosed among reproductive-age women, special note is made to the issue of TOAs occurring among postmenopausal women. Case series have reported that there is a high rate of malignancy among postmenopausal women with TOA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-complications-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/42-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-45</a>]. As an example, in one series, genital tract malignancy was found in 8 of 17 postmenopausal women compared with 1 of 76 premenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-complications-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Thus, postmenopausal women with a presumed TOA should be counseled about the potential for malignancy and the possible need for a full staging procedure. For these women, we suggest surgical diagnosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> treatment rather than treatment solely with antibiotics or a minimally invasive drainage procedure. An intraoperative frozen section analysis of the adnexal mass should be performed. In addition, the pelvis and abdomen should be surveyed for evidence of metastatic disease. Surgical staging should be performed, if appropriate and if the patient has given informed consent. Another potential management option in some cases may be initial antibiotic therapy with subsequent surgical intervention used with persistence of pelvic masses after the acute infection is managed.

The approach to a pregnant woman with a TOA is similar to nonpregnant women. Care should be taken to avoid medications that are potentially teratogenic (eg, quinolones). In addition, decisions regarding surgical care will depend in part upon the safety of surgery at a specific gestational age.
