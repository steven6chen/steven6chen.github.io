The body of literature focusing on the behavioral effects of food additives suggests that some children (both with and without ADHD) may have identifiable sensitivity to specific additives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/72-77\" class=\"abstract_t\">72-77</a>]. However, this conclusion is not universally accepted, and the issue remains controversial. In March 2011, the Food Advisory Committee of the US Food and Drug Administration determined that existing data do not support a causal link between consumption of color additives and hyperactivity or other problematic behaviors in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].</p><p>Food additives were first suggested as a potential cause of hyperactive behavior in the 1970s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. Studies that followed yielded mixed results. In a 2012 meta-analysis of five randomized crossover studies, restriction diets reduced ADHD symptoms in children (effect size 0.29, 95% CI 0.16-0.52) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Masked challenge with specific food colors had a small effect on parent-reported ADHD symptoms (20 studies, 794 participants, effect size 0.18, 95% CI 0.08-0.29), and a non-significant effect on teacher-reported symptoms (10 studies, 323 participants effect size 0.07, 95% CI -0.03-0.18). This discrepancy between parent and health <span class=\"nowrap\">professional/teacher</span> report of symptoms has been noted in other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/72,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,80</a>].</p><p>Although these findings support a relationship between food additives and ADHD symptoms in some children, they do not prove that food additives cause ADHD. Major practice guidelines for the treatment of ADHD and for food allergy management do not routinely recommend elimination of food additives in the management of children with ADHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/2,7,31,32,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7,31,32,81</a>].

There are two proposed mechanisms: an allergy to refined sugar and functional reactive hypoglycemia (which triggers release of stress hormones such as adrenaline) after ingesting sugar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/73,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,84</a>].</p><p>A 1995 meta-analysis of 23 studies in which sugar was eliminated from the diet <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> children were challenged with sugar failed to support an association between sugar intake and hyperactivity, attention span, or cognitive functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. However, a small effect of sugar on subsets of children could not be excluded. A 2005 systematic review that included a slightly different set of trials supported the conclusion of the earlier meta-analysis, but points out that most of the trials used relatively low-sugar challenges (equivalent to roughly one 16 ounce bottle of soda) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Food sensitivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are few well-designed trials evaluating the potential association between food sensitivity (allergy or intolerance) and behavior.
