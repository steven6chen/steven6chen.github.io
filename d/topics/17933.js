Classic features include auricular inflammation, saddle-nose deformity, and other features of cartilage destruction, but clinical manifestations can vary between patients, and the cardiovascular, renal, and nervous systems may also be affected. Another disorder is also present in association with RPC in approximately one-third of patients, usually some form of systemic vasculitis or a systemic rheumatic disease.</p><p>The course of RPC also varies considerably between patients and is difficult to predict. Disease may be episodic, relatively benign and free of clinically evident major organ involvement, continuously active but with fluctuating severity, or exhibit a fulminant and progressive course resulting in death.</p><p>The treatment of patients with RPC is presented here. The etiology and pathogenesis, pathology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of this disease are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-relapsing-polychondritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and pathogenesis of relapsing polychondritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-relapsing-polychondritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of relapsing polychondritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-relapsing-polychondritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of relapsing polychondritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-relapsing-polychondritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of relapsing polychondritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The type of medical therapy varies with the clinical estimate of disease activity and severity. Effective suppression of the clinical features can generally be achieved using immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory medications, although no form of therapy has been proven to modify the natural history of the disease (see <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below). Procedural interventions, including surgery, are sometimes required.</p><p>The relative rarity of relapsing polychondritis (RPC) has prevented the systematic evaluation of potential drug therapies for their efficacy and safety in randomized trials. Thus, the approach to pharmacologic therapy is largely based upon observations in case series, multiple case reports, and clinical experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>Factors that may affect therapeutic decisions include the disease course and severity, concurrent systemic symptoms, the sites of involvement, the duration of disease activity, the initial response to therapy, and the frequency of relapse. Importantly, treatment choices may also be influenced by the therapies required for associated comorbid conditions, requiring modification of the treatment approaches described here to optimize efficacy while minimizing adverse effects.</p><p>Several general principles apply to the treatment of RPC, despite the limitations of the available evidence regarding therapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Extent and severity of disease</strong> &ndash; Decisions about therapy require the identification or exclusion of potential subclinical disease involving major organs, although active cardiac, tracheobronchial, and large artery involvement, which generally indicate the need for aggressive therapy, are sometimes asymptomatic or difficult to detect. The following testing, described in more detail separately, should be performed in all patients diagnosed with RPC prior to the institution of therapy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-relapsing-polychondritis#H737754542\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of relapsing polychondritis&quot;, section on 'Overview of post-diagnostic testing'</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Otolaryngology consultation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Baseline pulmonary function testing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Chest radiography</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Electrocardiography</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Renal function (serum creatinine) and urinalysis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) panel</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Additional studies should be obtained in selected patients, depending upon the patient's history and findings; the indications for these studies are described in detail separately and may include additional imaging, such as computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET)/CT</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); bronchoscopy; echocardiography; autoantibody testing; and other laboratory investigations.

Patients in apparent clinical remission may have ongoing and important subclinical disease activity. Moreover, the duration of required therapy can vary significantly depending on the degree of clinical involvement. (See <a href=\"#H1562750692\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring and duration of therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with simple auricular, costochondral, or nasal chondritis, intermittent therapy for periodic flares is often sufficient. For severe manifestations, such as laryngotracheal involvement, prolonged immunosuppression is often necessary, and distinguishing active disease from permanent damage can be challenging.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">AURICULAR OR NASAL CHONDRITIS, ARTHRITIS, AND LACK OF MAJOR ORGAN DISEASE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3478315269\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial treatment with NSAIDs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with relapsing polychondritis (RPC) who have nasal or auricular chondritis and those with peripheral or axial arthritis but <strong>no</strong> major organ-threatening involvement (ie, no major airway inflammation, stenosis, or collapse; cardiac disease; vasculitis; ocular, renal, or neurologic disease attributable to RPC), we suggest initial treatment with a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) at a full antiinflammatory dose (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> 500 mg twice daily or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> 800 mg three to four times daily). Once the desired response is achieved, the medication should be used in the lowest dose and for the shortest duration necessary.</p><p>In our experience and described in case series, an NSAID may be sufficient in this setting if it is given in adequate doses to suppress clinical evidence of inflammation; use of an NSAID may help to avoid other drugs with potential adverse effects such as glucocorticoids or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>Brief analgesic supplementation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tramadol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tramadol</a> (50 to 100 mg two to four times daily) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocodone</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a></span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(5/500</span> mg two to four times daily) can be added if required but should be used in the lowest doses necessary and stopped once the flare of chondritis is resolving.</p><p>In patients in whom NSAIDs are contraindicated, a glucocorticoid or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> should be used, using the same approach as in patients who are resistant to NSAIDs. (See <a href=\"#H2387522014\" class=\"local\">'Resistant to NSAIDs'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2387522014\"><span class=\"h2\">Resistant to NSAIDs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with an inadequate response to at least 7 to 10 days of treatment with an NSAID in an antiinflammatory dose, who have nasal or auricular chondritis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> peripheral or axial arthritis but <strong>no</strong> major organ-threatening involvement, we suggest glucocorticoids rather than continued trials of different NSAIDs (see <a href=\"#H1731955919\" class=\"local\">'Systemic glucocorticoids'</a> below). Another potentially effective option in patients with these disease characteristics is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a>. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Dapsone'</a> below.)</p><p>Both glucocorticoids and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> can decrease disease activity and reduce the frequency of recurrence. A response is evident in the majority of patients given one of these agents within one to two weeks. We generally prefer glucocorticoids because they have fewer contraindications and are often better tolerated than dapsone, which may be associated with cutaneous eruptions and hemolysis. However, for mild, non-deforming chondritis, dapsone may be used as an alternative to glucocorticoids in patients with relative contraindications to glucocorticoids, such as diabetes.</p><p>Intraarticular glucocorticoids may be of benefit in patients with one or a few involved joints, and, in patients whose other manifestations respond to NSAIDs, such treatment may help to avoid the need for glucocorticoid or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> therapy. (See <a href=\"#H1006182932\" class=\"local\">'Resistant mono/oligoarthritis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1731955919\"><span class=\"h3\">Systemic glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial dose of glucocorticoids depends upon the severity of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Most patients respond to 30 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (or its equivalent) in divided doses. Once the disease activity has remitted, the dose should be tapered to the lowest maintenance level and eventually discontinued as tolerated. Alternate-day dosing is <strong>not</strong> recommended in RPC.</p><p>The effectiveness of glucocorticoids in this population has been shown in case reports and case series and is consistent with our experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].</p><p>Long-term, low-dose glucocorticoid therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 5 to 7.5 mg daily) may be necessary to suppress flares. If the dose cannot be tapered to this level, the addition of a glucocorticoid-sparing agent is advised. (See <a href=\"#H957213853\" class=\"local\">'Resistant to glucocorticoids'</a> below.)</p><p>The adverse effects of glucocorticoids and the approach to prevention of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis are described in detail separately.

The dose is increased, if necessary, in 25 mg increments every one to two weeks to a maximum dose of 200 mg daily. Once the desired response is obtained, the dose should be gradually tapered to the lowest effective maintenance level. An attempt should be made to discontinue the drug if there has been persistent clinical stabilization and normalization of laboratory parameters such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dapsone</a> may be effective for primary manifestations of RPC, including auricular and nasal chondritis. However, in patients who respond to dapsone, long-term therapy is sometimes necessary to suppress flares.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dapsone</a> should not be used as monotherapy in patients with sudden hearing loss, vertigo, or laryngotracheal involvement; these patients require a more intensive treatment approach.

Dapsone should not be used if there is a history of allergy to sulfonamides, severe anemia, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, or if the patient is pregnant or breastfeeding.</p><p>The efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> has been shown in case reports and case series and is consistent with our clinical experience. As an example, in one small series, improvement was seen in all seven patients treated with dapsone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The average dose was 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> for four months (range 25 mg to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> duration one week to two years). Dapsone (a sulfone) is thought to act through its presumed enzyme inhibitory and immunomodulatory properties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1006182932\"><span class=\"h3\">Resistant mono/oligoarthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An intraarticular glucocorticoid injection may be beneficial in patients with mild chondritis who respond to NSAIDs, glucocorticoids, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a>, but who have persistent arthritis in one or only a few joints that is resistant to those therapies. Precautions, dosing, and adverse effects are the same as in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory arthritides.

In mild to moderate disease, we typically use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX) for this purpose. MTX is used in a similar fashion to its use in mild to moderate organ and tissue involvement and for maintenance therapy of life- or organ-threatening disease. (See <a href=\"#H4247127728\" class=\"local\">'Initial control of disease'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2632586890\" class=\"local\">'Maintenance therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>As an alternative, patients who do not respond to initial therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> can be treated with a combination of these two drugs. Although a combination of dapsone and prednisone has also been used in patients presenting with auricular and nasal chondritis that is complicated by sudden hearing loss or vertigo, more reliably tolerated and effective choices have been preferred as more experience has been gained in RPC with other glucocorticoid-sparing strategies.

Management principles are the same as those that apply to other patients with obstructive airway disease and immune compromise.</p><p>Patients with relapsing polychondritis (RPC) are at increased risk for infection, which is a leading cause of death in this disorder. At least two factors contribute to this problem: the use of immunosuppressive drugs and obstruction associated with inherent features of the disease, such as laryngotracheal and bronchial involvement, leading to abnormal drainage of respiratory secretions and ineffective cough due to dynamic upper airway collapse. Although use of immunosuppressive drugs precludes the use of live vaccines and may impair the antibody response to other vaccinations, we suggest the administration of influenza and pneumococcal vaccines for patients with significant laryngotracheobronchial disease.</p><p>Although increasing the dose of glucocorticoids may be sufficient for control of an exacerbation of many features of disease, delay in its onset of action poses a particular hazard in patients with airway compromise due to inflammation. The use of nebulized racemic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ephedrine-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ephedrine</a> may be effective in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>], while there is insufficient information concerning the use of inhaled glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

Nasal septal repair is usually performed using a costal cartilage graft; however, in RPC patients, there has been concern for a possible relapse in a cartilage graft. Some reconstructive surgeons have successfully used bone grafts instead to avoid this potential complication.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laryngotracheal and bronchial chondritis can cause potentially fatal airway narrowing. Three factors can contribute to this problem: inflammation; fibrosis-induced contractures; <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> loss of cartilaginous structural support, which results in dynamic airway collapse during forced inspiration (larynx) or expiration (trachea). Involvement of glottic, subglottic, and upper tracheal regions may necessitate tracheostomy. It is important to appreciate, however, that tracheostomy may be ineffective in patients with more distal focal or diffuse airway narrowing.</p><p>Regions of segmental collapse, due to tracheomalacia, refractory stenosis, or inflammatory masses, may be surgically resected or treated with an expandable metal stent, although the results of stenting vary and this approach is sometimes ineffective, in our experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/50-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-53</a>]. Stents eventually become epithelialized, preventing migration and permitting continued ciliary activity. Significant complications of stenting include airway inflammation, stent migration, airway erosion and stent fracture and airway collapse proximal and distal to the stent. Some patients do not tolerate this intervention and may require removal of the stent soon after its insertion. This complication is often related to collapse of the airway distal to the stent. The use of bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) after surgical management may help keep narrowed airways from collapsing, especially at night [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

These include external tracheal fixation by suspension to the vascular adventitia of the aorta using pericardium, dura, or Gore-Tex implants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]; the use of silastic tube prostheses; or esophageal tracheoplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Localized inflammatory and mucosal fibrotic lesions leading to severe main stem bronchial obstruction have been successfully treated with Nd:YAG laser ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>Reported results of laryngotracheal reconstruction procedures are poor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. If such techniques are to be considered for isolated segments of tracheal or subglottic stenosis, timing of the operation is critical. Surgery should only be contemplated when the disease is well controlled or in remission. There must be meticulous pre- and postoperative medical management of the disease process to avoid complications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Valvular and aortic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients should be referred for surgical consultation for valve replacement or valvuloplasty in the presence of intractable heart failure due to valvular involvement in RPC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. Aortic aneurysms have also been successfully resected. However, a high incidence of surgical failure has been reported, perhaps due to contiguous active inflammation at operative sites or even induction of activity in regions of surgical trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>The management of valvular problems remains controversial because the preferred procedures and the optimal time for surgical intervention remain unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Since &quot;silent inflammation&quot; progresses both in the aortic wall and the aortic or mitral annuli despite glucocorticoid treatment, the complete replacement of the ascending aorta using a composite graft and reimplantation of the coronary arteries in patients with disease involving the ascending aorta has been recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Optimal medical control of inflammation must be obtained prior to performing such elective surgery.</p><p>Although glucocorticoids may be efficacious in cardiac complications such as acute inflammatory heart block, the development of an atrioventricular block late in the course of disease may require placement of a permanent pacemaker.

Laryngeal or tracheobronchial disease can cause major anesthetic problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/51,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,63</a>]; endotracheal intubation of patients with RPC may be difficult or impossible. As examples, a small glottis destroyed by inflammation may lead to difficulty with intubation and intratracheal manipulation can lead to life-threatening postanesthetic deterioration by causing further glottal or subglottal inflammation.</p><p>However, there are a number of settings in which general anesthesia may be required in the management of RPC, including bronchoscopy, tracheostomy, and other surgical procedures. (See <a href=\"#H26679864\" class=\"local\">'Saddle nose deformity repair'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Airway obstruction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Valvular and aortic disease'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1562750692\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING AND DURATION OF THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with limited cartilage involvement such as just auricular inflammation, follow-up is determined by the requirement of maintenance therapies. If the disease remains quiescent after several months of treatment, tapering therapy should be considered. In patients with an associated systemic disease such as vasculitis or myelodysplasia, the associated condition will determine the frequency and requirements of follow-up. In patients with laryngotracheal involvement, ongoing monitoring by the rheumatologist, otolaryngologist, and pulmonologist is necessary. At a minimum, annual spirometry and visualization of the upper airway is usually indicated. Follow-up computed tomography (CT) or other advanced airway imaging is done on a case-by-case basis.</p><p>Duration of required therapy can vary significantly depending upon the degree of clinical involvement. For patients with simple auricular, costochondral, or nasal chondritis, intermittent therapy for periodic flares is often sufficient (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Auricular or nasal chondritis, arthritis, and lack of major organ disease'</a> above). For severe manifestations, such as laryngotracheal involvement, prolonged immunosuppression is often necessary (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Life- or organ-threatening disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Additional measures for airway disease'</a> above). In the latter setting, in particular, distinguishing active disease from damage is challenging and may require periodic direct visualization of the airway by otolaryngology or pulmonary specialists. The role of positron emission tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET)/CT</span> scanning as a noninvasive method for following active airway inflammation is a potentially attractive option that needs further formal evaluation. A relapsing polychondritis (RPC) disease activity index has been developed but will require longitudinal evaluation to determine its utility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pattern of case reporting in relapsing polychondritis (RPC) prevents an accurate assessment of the overall prognosis. Among the problems are often incomplete documentation in single or a limited series of patients; large series derived from tertiary care centers to which more severely ill patients are referred; and the underreporting, lack of reporting, or failure of recognition of milder forms of the disease. The limited information available thus suggests a more ominous outlook than is necessarily likely.</p><p>Although the course of RPC can on occasion be rapidly fatal, the more frequent patterns reflect either a relatively benign or chronic indolent disease process, extending over many years with ultimate death stemming from unrelated causes. Effective suppression of the clinical features can generally be achieved using available medications, although no form of therapy has been shown to modify the natural history of the disease. Some form of disability is common in later stages of RPC; this may include visual impairment, audiovestibular dysfunction, and cardiopulmonary disease.</p><p>The largest study, published in 1986, reported a comprehensive analysis of 112 patients followed for a median duration of approximately six years (range of one month to 20 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Intermittent inflammatory manifestations were noted by 86 percent of patients, with a median of five episodes per patient; the remaining 14 percent had continuous disease activity. The median survival from the time of diagnosis was 11 years, with 5- and 10-year probabilities of survival of 74 and 55 percent, respectively.</p><p>However, a more favorable prognosis was reported in 1998 in a subsequent series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In this review of 66 patients with an average disease duration of eight years, the survival rate was 94 percent.</p><p>The age at presentation appears to predict mortality. The death rate reported in younger patients (&lt;50 years of age) with aggressive disease ranges from 28 to 50 percent during the follow-up period in various series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>]. The most frequent causes of death are infection, laryngotracheal or bronchial involvement (especially stricture or collapse with resultant respiratory failure or superimposed pneumonia), and vasculitis.</p><p>Additional adverse prognostic features include valvular heart disease with intractable heart failure, renal disease, intercurrent malignancy, and anemia. A 1995 literature review of valvular heart disease in 440 patients with RPC made the following observations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-relapsing-polychondritis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mean time from the onset of RPC to the need for operative intervention was 6.5 years (range five months to 21 years).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery was performed an average of one year after the diagnosis of valvular incompetence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reoperation was required in 24 percent of cases in the first four postoperative years.

Pretreatment evaluation is necessary to assess symptomatic and subclinical disease and includes otolaryngology consultation, baseline pulmonary function testing, chest radiography, electrocardiography, renal function testing and urinalysis, and testing for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA).
