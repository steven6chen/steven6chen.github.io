However, there are numerous reports of successful pregnancies in patients with ET who were treated with HU, and in a review of the literature on the use of HU in ET, AML, chronic myeloid leukemia, and sickle cell disease, there were no reports of fetal malformations in nine patients exposed to HU in the first trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-essential-thrombocythemia/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>].

The use of anagrelide or HU should not be withheld from the high-risk pregnant woman who does not tolerate interferon alfa therapy, provided she is well-informed of the risks and benefits.</p><p>While pregnancy may compound the thrombotic risk of ET, we do not routinely offer prophylaxis in this setting unless there are other indications for thromboprophylaxis. This is principally due to a lack of prospective trials evaluating the efficacy of thromboprophylaxis with heparin in women with ET during pregnancy or postpartum.
