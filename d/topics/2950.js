Infants who are discharged from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) require continued comprehensive clinical care, which is provided by the primary care provider clinician.</p><p>This topic will review the care of the infant provided by primary care clinician who is discharged from the NICU. The discussion focuses on preterm infants who represent the majority of NICU graduates. Criteria for discharge and planning for discharge are presented separately.

We concur with these guidelines that highlight the shared responsibility of the care of the infant between the primary care provider and the neonatologist, the need for effective communication with the family and other professionals involved in the care of the infant, the importance of continuity of care at the time of discharge from the NICU, and the role of the primary care clinician to provide direct care for these infants. The primary care clinician:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Communicates with the neonatologist and family during the NICU course of the infant; especially important when the infant is getting close to being ready for discharge to home or transfer to a Level 2 facility. Ongoing communication facilitates the transfer of medical information (patient's medical history, medications, and technologic needs); allows collaborative arrangements for follow-up with primary, subspecialty, and neurodevelopmental care; and determines the appropriate timing of transfer. For the family, contact with both the neonatologist and primary care provider decreases confusion, anxiety and uncertainty regarding transfer of care.

The primary care provider should confirm that the family understands the infant's medical diagnoses, and any medications (including administration and schedule) and equipment required in <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> care. During this visit, the clinician should also check on how the family is handling the responsibility and stress of bringing an infant home from the NICU.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Review the patient's future appointments with subspecialty services and the schedule of subsequent primary care visits and hearing and vision screening.

The schedule depends on the patient's medical status but in general, primary care visits will be more frequent in the beginning (eg, every one to two weeks) to monitor and establish adequate growth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Growth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NICU graduates are at risk for inadequate growth due to their increased caloric and nutrient requirements, and feeding difficulties. After discharge from the hospital, these patients require frequent monitoring of their growth and overall nutritional intake. Greater weight gain before reaching term equivalent appears to be associated with improved neurodevelopmental outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-neonatal-intensive-care-unit-graduate/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. If growth is inappropriate (inadequate or excessive), the infant's nutrition is evaluated and corrective measures (eg, changes in the composition, volume, and caloric density of the feeds, and mode of feeding) are initiated as needed. In addition, evaluation for contributing conditions (eg, gastroesophageal reflux or feeding difficulties) may be performed. Monitoring the growth and nutritional management of the preterm NICU graduate are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=growth-management-in-preterm-infants#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Growth management in preterm infants&quot;, section on 'Monitoring of growth'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=growth-management-in-preterm-infants#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Growth management in preterm infants&quot;, section on 'Interventions'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastroesophageal-reflux-in-premature-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastroesophageal reflux in premature infants&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastroesophageal-reflux-in-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastroesophageal reflux in infants&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Feeding difficulties are more common among children who were extremely preterm (gestational age &lt;28 weeks) due to swallowing problems, oral motor dysfunction, hypersensitivity, delayed feeding skill development, and behavioral problems (oral aversion) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-oral-feeding-difficulties-due-to-sucking-and-swallowing-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal oral feeding difficulties due to sucking and swallowing disorders&quot;</a>).

As a result, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) generally recommends that medically stable preterm infants should receive full immunization based upon their chronological age consistent with the schedule and dose recommended for normal full-term infants (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82617\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82617 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/care-of-the-neonatal-intensive-care-unit-graduate/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H611093505\" class=\"local\">'Ophthalmologic conditions'</a> below.)</p><p>ROP, a developmental vascular proliferative retinal disorder, presents at approximately 32 weeks gestation, peaks at 38 to 40 weeks, and begins to regress by 46 weeks. Initial retinal screening by an ophthalmologist should be performed four to six weeks after birth (which typically occurs in the NICU) with additional examinations at intervals of one to three weeks until the retinal vessels have fully matured. In addition, follow-up examinations are required for infants who develop ROP and are at risk for recurrence after treatment. Infants with ROP are also at risk for myopia, astigmatism, anisometropia, and strabismus. Compliance with screening is imperative, as ROP is the second most common cause of childhood blindness, and treatment can reduce the morbidity of this condition.

In many states, infants are referred to early intervention programs directly from the NICU. Primary care clinicians should be familiar with their state's requirements and ensure eligible patients have been referred or initiate a new referral as soon as possible after discharge home. Following referral, primary care clinicians should follow up with the family to ensure that the infant is receiving appropriate services specific to the infant's developmental needs. The long-term neurodevelopment outcome of preterm infants and their follow-up care are discussed separately.

The incidence of maternal depression and anxiety is high both during their infant's NICU stay and especially in the months after discharge to home. The clinician should be attentive to these stresses and provide care and assistance to parents. Support services, such as referral for individual therapy, home health nursing visits, early child interventions services, and support groups, should be offered to parents of the NICU graduate.

Infants with BPD typically have abnormal lung function during the first year of life and require monitoring and supportive care. At discharge, cardiorespiratory parameters (respiratory and heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen requirement, chest radiograph, and echocardiogram to assess for pulmonary hypertension) should be obtained as a baseline status of the patient. At home, these infants may continue to require supplemental oxygen, medications (eg, diuretics and bronchodilators), and increased caloric needs. Clinical management (in collaboration with subspecialists) is focused on monitoring the cardiorespiratory status and risk for pulmonary hypertension of the patient, ensuring optimal growth, and minimizing respiratory exacerbations.
