SIP occurs primarily in preterm infants with very low birth weight (VLBW, birth weight &lt;1500 g) and extremely low birth weight (ELBW, birth weight &lt;1000 g). SIP is a separate clinical entity from necrotizing enterocolitis, the most severe gastrointestinal complication of preterm infants. This differentiation is important because of management considerations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis in newborns&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of spontaneous intestinal perforation of the newborn will be reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spontaneous intestinal perforation (SIP) is most commonly found in very low birth weight (VLBW, BW &lt;1500 g) and extremely low birth weight (ELBW, BW &lt;1000 g) preterm infants. The risk appears to be approximately 2 to 3 percent in VLBW infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intestinal-perforation-of-the-newborn/abstract/1,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,7</a>] and approximately 5 percent in ELBW infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intestinal-perforation-of-the-newborn/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The median gestational age varies from 25 to 27 weeks, and median birth weight from 670 to 973 g [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intestinal-perforation-of-the-newborn/abstract/1-3,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,9,10</a>]. SIP occurs more frequently in male infants (ranging from 65 to 71 percent of affected infants) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intestinal-perforation-of-the-newborn/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prematurity is the only well-established risk factor for SIP.

However, these risk factors might be surrogate markers for ill premature infants, rather than causative. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In very low birth weight (VLBW) neonates with spontaneous intestinal perforation (SIP), there is a single isolated perforation that is typically found at the terminal ileum, but has also been reported in the jejunum and colon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intestinal-perforation-of-the-newborn/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. At the area of perforation, focal hemorrhagic necrosis with well-defined margins is observed in contrast to the ischemic and coagulative necrosis seen in necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intestinal-perforation-of-the-newborn/abstract/4,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,26</a>]. In SIP, the bowel proximal and distal to the perforation appears normal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69039\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69039 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>The etiology of SIP remains unknown. Several studies have explored a variety of different pathogenetic pathways.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although thinning or absence of the muscularis propria at the perforation site has been reported in several cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intestinal-perforation-of-the-newborn/abstract/2,26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,26-29</a>], it is unclear whether these changes are involved in the pathogenesis of SIP.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A role for nitric oxide synthase (NOS) has been suggested based upon a single study of a NOS knock-out mouse model that demonstrated ileal perforation with exposure to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">indomethacin</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dexamethasone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intestinal-perforation-of-the-newborn/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The profiles of immunoregulatory protein expression were examined using cytokine antibody assay, and measuring specific protein concentration (ELISA) and mRNA expression in serum and intestinal tissue of preterm infants with SIP and NEC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intestinal-perforation-of-the-newborn/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Gene expression for inflammation, angiogenesis, wound healing, and apoptosis were markedly different between the NEC group and the SIP group of patients. Specifically, interleukin (IL)-6, angiopoietin-2, soluble type II interleukin-1 receptor (sIL-1RII), and soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor were markedly higher in the NEC group. This abnormal upregulation in the immune response to NEC may account for the differences in mortality and morbidity observed in NEC and SIP patients. Further support for an immunoregulatory pathogenesis was provided by a follow-up study that examined whole genome microarray analysis of intestinal samples from 15 infants with NEC, 12 infants with SIP, and 14 surgical control infants with noninflammatory bowel conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intestinal-perforation-of-the-newborn/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The intestinal NEC samples demonstrated a greater degree of upregulation of immunoregulatory pathways than the SIP and control samples. These processes included angiogenesis, arginine metabolism, cell adhesion and chemotaxis, extracellular matrix remodeling, hypoxia and oxidative stress, inflammation, and muscle contraction. SIP intestinal samples displayed a milder and less diversified gene expression, with target genes associated with muscle contraction and extracellular matrix remodeling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intestinal-perforation-of-the-newborn/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spontaneous intestinal perforation (SIP) and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) are gastrointestinal complications that typically occur in very low birth weight (VLBW) and extremely low birth weight (ELBW) preterm infants with a gestational age between 25 and 27 weeks. These two conditions result in significant morbidity and mortality. Since the management of these two disorders may differ, it is important to distinguish between SIP and NEC. In addition, early identification and treatment of SIP significantly reduces mortality and morbidity. (See <a href=\"#H2751227474\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Age at presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In several case series of SIP, the median age at perforation is seven days with a range of 0 to 15 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intestinal-perforation-of-the-newborn/abstract/1,2,4,10,12,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,4,10,12,33,34</a>]. An analysis from the Pediatrix Medical Group data set demonstrated that neonates with SIP presented earlier in life than those with NEC (median age 7 versus 15 days of life) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intestinal-perforation-of-the-newborn/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Risk factors for SIP may vary according to the time of presentation.

Infants in the first group (n = 116), who presented between zero and three days of life, were larger (median birth weight 1.4 kg) and less likely to have received antenatal glucocorticoids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">indomethacin</a>, surfactant, or mechanical ventilation compared with infants in the second group who presented between 7 and 10 days of age with a median birth weight of 775 g.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants with SIP present with an acute onset of abdominal distension and hypotension.

These findings include abdominal distension, often with the classical bluish discoloration of the abdominal wall in the absence of abdominal wall erythema, crepitus, and induration. Imaging studies are useful in supporting the diagnosis of SIP, if there are findings that differentiate SIP from necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).</p><p>The diagnosis of SIP is strongly suspected if there are clinical and radiologic findings of pneumoperitoneum in the absence of pneumatosis intestinalis and portal venous air. The diagnosis of SIP is made by operative findings that demonstrate an isolated bowel perforation in the setting of otherwise normal bowel, which is confirmed by histopathologic examination. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Surgical treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abdominal radiographs that demonstrate pneumoperitoneum support the diagnosis of SIP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66483\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef66483 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59853\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59853 \">image 2</a>).

However, a gasless abdomen may be seen in patients with SIP when the perforation is walled off and free air is not present, but this is not a typical finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intestinal-perforation-of-the-newborn/abstract/4,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,33</a>]. In these patients, ultrasound may be useful in making the diagnosis of perforation if echogenic free fluid is detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intestinal-perforation-of-the-newborn/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2751227474\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary differential diagnosis of SIP is necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC).

An alternate option is primary peritoneal drainage (PPD). If successful, PPD, which is performed at the bedside, avoids laparotomy and the need for general anesthesia and transport to the operating room for these very preterm and often severely ill patients. Many pediatric surgeons support the use of PPD in infants with SIP, as many of these patients will recover without any further surgical intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intestinal-perforation-of-the-newborn/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>There are no randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing these two surgical interventions only in infants with SIP. Case series report that in infants with SIP, PPD generally was both a stabilizing and definitive treatment, and most infants did not need further surgical intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intestinal-perforation-of-the-newborn/abstract/40-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-43</a>].</p><p>In a review of the literature, two RCTs were identified that compared PPD and exploratory laparotomy in newborns with SIP and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intestinal-perforation-of-the-newborn/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

After the administration of intravenous pain medication, the abdomen is prepped with iodine solution, and local anesthesia is administered. A small transverse incision is made at McBurney's point (two-thirds of the distance from the umbilicus to the anterior superior iliac crest in the right lower quadrant). The layers of the abdominal wall are bluntly dissected to enter the peritoneal cavity. In many cases, there will be a rush of air and the presence of meconium encountered. Cultures are taken and a Penrose drain is gently threaded into the abdomen and secured. In some centers, the peritoneal cavity is irrigated with warm saline solution prior to the insertion of the Penrose drain, although there are no data to support this practice.</p><p>The drain site is observed over the subsequent days. When there is no evidence of persistent intestinal or meconium drainage from the drain site, the drain is backed out daily until it is removed.

This was best illustrated by the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective analysis of 9507 extremely low birth weight infants (birth weight &lt;1000 g) born between 2000 and 2005 registered in the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Neonatal Research Network, there were 472 patients with surgically treated NEC and 282 patients with SIP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intestinal-perforation-of-the-newborn/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In this cohort, mortality before discharge was 54, 39, and 22 percent for infants with surgical NEC, with SIP, and without either NEC or SIP, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study from The Vermont Oxford Network of very low birth weight infants (birth weight &lt;1500 g), the mortality rate was lower in patients with laparotomy-confirmed SIP versus those with laparotomy-confirmed NEC (19 verus 38 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intestinal-perforation-of-the-newborn/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Mortality in both groups decreased with increasing birth weight.</p><p/><p>Patients with SIP and NEC appear to have similar risks for either death or neurodevelopmental impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intestinal-perforation-of-the-newborn/abstract/46,49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,49,50</a>]. In the NICHD study, death or neurological impairment occurred in 82, 79, and 53 percent of patients with surgical NEC, SIP, and those without NEC or SIP, respectively. Multivariate analysis demonstrated an increased risk of death and neurologic impairment for patients with SIP compared with controls (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.21, 95% CI 1.5-3.2) and patients with surgical NEC (adjusted OR 2.11, 95% 1.5-9.2). In a separate analysis of survivors, the risk of neurodevelopmental impairment was increased in those with SIP (adjusted OR 2.17, 95% CI 1.4-3.2) and surgical NEC (adjusted OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2-2.4) compared with controls. Infants with SIP also appear to be at increased risk to develop retinopathy of prematurity and periventricular leukomalacia compared with those without SIP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-intestinal-perforation-of-the-newborn/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=long-term-complications-of-the-preterm-infant\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Long-term complications of the preterm infant&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retinopathy-of-prematurity-pathogenesis-epidemiology-classification-and-screening#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retinopathy of prematurity: Pathogenesis, epidemiology, classification, and screening&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spontaneous intestinal perforation (SIP) of the newborn is a single intestinal perforation typically found at the terminal ileum.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SIP occurs primarily in preterm, very low birth weight (VLBW, birth weight &lt;1500 g) infants, with a reported prevalence between 2 and 3 percent. Although prematurity is the only well established risk factor, other reported risk factors include severe chorioamnionitis, postnatal glucocorticoid therapy, and possibly postnatal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">indomethacin</a> therapy. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SIP generally presents within the first 10 days of life as an acute onset of abdominal distension and hypotension. The classical physical finding is a black-bluish discoloration of the abdominal wall. In contrast, abdominal wall erythema, crepitus, and induration commonly seen with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) are not usually present in infants with SIP. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical diagnosis for SIP is based upon the clinical presentation and physical findings. Abdominal radiographs that demonstrate pneumoperitoneum without pneumatosis are supportive of the diagnosis. The definitive diagnosis is based upon direct visualization of the intestinal perforation in the setting of an otherwise healthy appearing small bowel. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NEC is the main disease in the differential diagnosis of SIP. Differentiation between the two disorders is usually based upon the clinical manifestations and abdominal radiographic findings, although there is considerable overlap between the two conditions. (See <a href=\"#H2751227474\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial management for a neonate with SIP is directed towards stabilization of the patient. This includes discontinuing feeds and enteral medications, nasogastric suctioning, and supportive care, such as fluid resuscitation, antibiotics, and inotropic medications to correct hypotension. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment for SIP is surgical. We suggest primary peritoneal drainage as the initial treatment for SIP (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). An alternative option is laparotomy with bowel resection, and either primary anastomosis or creation of an ostomy. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term survival of infants with SIP has improved over the past 30 years with reported survival rates of 64 to 90 percent. However, survivors are at risk for neurodevelopmental impairment.
