EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) can be performed at the same time as the diagnostic examination and offers a diagnostic accuracy of 60 to 90 percent depending upon the site. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-fine-needle-aspiration-biopsy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy in the gastrointestinal tract&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, EUS-FNA is associated with several limitations. It may not always be possible to assess the adequacy of sampling during the procedure and cytologic interpretation can be hampered by the presence of blood and benign epithelial cells. Furthermore, tumors that are well differentiated or contain substantial desmoplasia are more difficult to diagnose using cytology alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-trucut-biopsy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Finally, EUS-FNA typically yields a small biopsy sample and destroys the tissue architecture, thereby limiting diagnostic accuracy for lesions such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors and lymphomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-trucut-biopsy/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>Larger caliber cutting needles were designed to overcome many of the problems associated with FNA. These needles acquire larger tissue specimens, thereby preserving tissue architecture and permitting histologic rather than only cytologic examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-trucut-biopsy/abstract/4-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-11</a>]. Several studies have demonstrated that large caliber cutting needles are safe and accurate when used percutaneously, intraluminally, or surgically for diagnosing lesions arising in soft tissue, breast, lung, lymph node, pancreas, liver, kidney, adrenal, spleen, prostate, and other sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-trucut-biopsy/abstract/11-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-23</a>].</p><p>Multiple initial attempts were made to adapt a needle system that could be used with the echoendoscope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-trucut-biopsy/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. None were successful until the development of the trucut biopsy (TCB) needle (Quick-Core), which could be used with linear echoendoscopes.</p><p>This topic review will summarize clinical experience with EUS-TCB. A discussion on EUS-FNA is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-fine-needle-aspiration-biopsy-in-the-gastrointestinal-tract\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy in the gastrointestinal tract&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEVICE DESIGN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The trucut biopsy (TCB) device contains a spring-loaded mechanism built into the handle that permits automated procurement of biopsy specimens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F56460\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56460 \">picture 1</a>). As with EUS-FNA needles, an adjustable &quot;screw-stop lock&quot; is incorporated into the handle, and when unlocked, allows advancement up to 8 cm. The handle also incorporates an &quot;adjustment wheel&quot; that rotates the device into the proper orientation and slightly varies the length. In addition, a &quot;spacer&quot; can be added to allow for the variation in echoendoscope length among manufacturers. The non-handle portion of the TCB device consists of an outer catheter sheath, an internal 19 gauge cutting sheath, an 18 mm long specimen tray, and a 5 mm long stylet tip (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F70296\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70296 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DEVICE PREPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial preparation is required prior to insertion of the trucut biopsy (TCB) device in the echoendoscope. Doing so requires retraction of the handle into the firing position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F79541\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79541 \">picture 3</a>), which retracts both the cutting sheath and specimen tray. The inner needle remains in the withdrawn position until the biopsy is performed. The needle is then advanced until the tip is nearly flush with the catheter sheath (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F60008\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60008 \">picture 4</a>). Incomplete advancement of the needle tip may result in inadvertent puncture of the catheter and echoendoscope while over advancement risks damage to the echoendoscope's accessory channel. Once the TCB device is properly prepared, it is advanced through the echoendoscope and screwed securely into the biopsy channel Luer-lock adapter.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">BIOPSY TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The needle is carefully advanced under real-time endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) visualization with the spring handle in the retracted firing position. The spring handle is then pressed forward until resistance is felt, thereby advancing the specimen tray into the target lesion. When targeting the biopsy, the operator must be aware that the specimen tray will extend approximately 20 mm beyond the needle tip. Further pressure on the spring handle will fire the device and obtain a biopsy.</p><p>All controls (up-down and left-right) and the elevator should be released into a &quot;relaxed&quot; position. Subsequent biopsy requires full depression of the plunger in the direction of the accessory channel. This action serves to spring-fire the cutting sheath over the specimen tray.</p><p>Distinct echo features are discernible for the cutting sheath and specimen tray (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F77390\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77390 \">image 1</a>). This permits imaging of the specimen tray within the target tissue, thereby allowing the operator to monitor each step under continuous EUS imaging. The needle assembly is withdrawn into the catheter, the screw-stop is locked, and the entire TCB device is removed from the endoscope.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIMEN HANDLING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To retrieve the tissue from the specimen tray, the screw-stop is unlocked and the needle assembly (cutting sheath and internal specimen tray) is fully advanced. The spring handle is then retracted until it clicks into the firing position, which retracts both the outer cutting sheath and inner needle specimen tray. The spring handle is advanced until resistance is felt. This action advances the inner specimen tray to expose the biopsy tissue.</p><p>Once resistance is felt, the operator should discontinue pressing the plunger to avoid inadvertent firing. A needle is used to carefully remove the specimen from the specimen tray or one may simply place a tissue pad against the specimen to remove it (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F77967\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77967 \">picture 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F79040\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79040 \">picture 6</a>).</p><p>If needed, touch preps are made from the histologic core. The touch prep is prepared by gently touching a glass slide against the core of tissue. An onsite cytopathologist or cytotechnologist can thereby provide an assessment of the adequacy of sampling. The trucut biopsy (TCB) tissue cores are fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin prior to histological examination. When lymphoma is suspected, some material should be preserved in saline or another suitable media recommended by pathology for flow cytometry studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EUS-TCB TECHNICAL DETAILS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several issues arise with the trucut biopsy (TCB) needles that differ from endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA). Careful attention to these details is particularly important if initial biopsies are inadequate or non-diagnostic. The points of emphasis include: (1) site of TCB, (2) proper device rotational orientation, (3) targeting, and (4) straightening of the echoendoscope and needle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Site of EUS-TCB</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The TCB needle functions well in the esophagus, rectum, and most of the stomach. Performing EUS-TCB is difficult and less often yields an adequate specimen when used in the fundus, antrum, and duodenal bulb and is not recommended beyond the apex of the bulb. In all of these locations, echoendoscope angulation produces sluggish advancement of the cutting sheath over the specimen tray. Although EUS-TCB is impaired in certain locations, this does not appear to result in increased patient risk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Proper device rotational orientation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proper device orientation can improve tissue collection, which is performed by rotating the needle so that the 19-gauge marker on the TCB device is aligned with the model number on the echoendoscope handle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F74755\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74755 \">picture 7</a>). Correct orientation of the handle results in alignment of the specimen tray so that it directly faces the transducer. We have found that some variation in biopsy channel alignment exists within the same model of echoendoscopes, thereby requiring individual assessment for the proper needle orientation. Once determined, it can be used consistently for that instrument. However, if the echoendoscope undergoes repair, this alignment may change and require some adjustment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Targeting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When initially advancing the needle, the 18 mm long specimen tray and 1 mm of the distal stylet are retracted and contained within the cutting sheath. As a result, when the spring handle is pressed, the device will advance another 19 mm, potentially leading to traversal of the lesion and puncture of adjacent structures. This is of particular concern for small lesions and those juxtaposed to a vascular structure.</p><p>Such lesions can often be safely biopsied by only partially advancing the specimen tray into the lesion so that some of the specimen tray is within more superficial tissues <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the luminal mucosa. Caution is advised with this approach due to the potential for echoendoscope damage.</p><p>Another approach for the biopsy of smaller lesions <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> superficial lesions is to advance the specimen tray deeper than usual so that the specimen tray overlaps both the target tissue and deeper tissues. The safety of this approach depends upon the tissue underlying the target lesion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Straightening of the echoendoscope and needle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Keeping the echoendoscope and needle straightened as much as possible, both within and outside of the patient, facilitates tissue acquisition. Elevator and tip deflection should be minimal. Once the target lesion is entered, the controls should be relaxed; failing to do so results in sluggish advancement of the cutting sheath over the specimen tray. Attention to each of these technical aspects enhances tissue acquisition and may improve patient safety and minimize instrument damage. These considerations may limit the ability to target lesions in areas where only a sharply angled endoscopic alignment is possible, a frequent occurrence in the proximal stomach and duodenum.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFICACY AND SAFETY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the available data have not clearly demonstrated superiority to EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA), endoscopic ultrasound-guided trucut needle biopsy (EUS-TCB) may be more effective for diagnosis of submucosal mass lesions and lymphoma, potentially avoiding the need for more aggressive diagnostic or therapeutic procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-trucut-biopsy/abstract/26-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-38</a>]. Furthermore, EUS-TCB generally requires fewer needle passes compared with EUS-FNA. Regarding safety, in one large series of 247 patients, the overall complication rate was 2 percent, which is similar to that reported with EUS-FNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-trucut-biopsy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Mass lesions and lymphadenopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In several small studies using endoscopic ultrasound-guided trucut needle biopsy (EUS-TCB) to obtain histologic specimens of intra- and extraintestinal mass lesions and lymph nodes, the diagnostic accuracy of EUS-TCB ranged from 60 to 85 percent compared with the diagnostic accuracy of using endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) (50 to 90 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-trucut-biopsy/abstract/27-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-32</a>]. In one subgroup of 17 patients with either a submucosal lesion or lymphadenopathy, the accuracy of EUS-TCB was higher compared with EUS-FNA (88 versus 29 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-trucut-biopsy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In addition, fewer needle passes with the EUS-TCB were required to establish a diagnosis compared with EUS-FNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-trucut-biopsy/abstract/29,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,31</a>]. Complications of EUS-TCB that have been reported in this setting include bleeding and mediastinitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-trucut-biopsy/abstract/30,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,33</a>]. </p><p>EUS-FNA is useful as a rescue technique in cases of trucut biopsy (TCB) failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-trucut-biopsy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In a study of 30 patients with a total of 39 lesions underwent EUS-TCB and followed by EUS-FNA, only if the trucut biopsy failed to obtain an adequate sample or when the &quot;in room&quot; touch-prep suggested that the lesion was benign. Thirty-one lesions were malignant and eight were benign. Malignancy was detected using EUS-TCB for 26 of 31 lesions (84 percent, 95% CI 74-96 percent). EUS-TCB was unable to establish the correct diagnosis in 5 of 39 lesions (13 percent) as a result of failure to obtain an adequate sample either due to technical difficulties or due to a false negative result for malignancy. One patient developed minimal bleeding at the site of EUS-TCB and this was seen during the EUS exam [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-trucut-biopsy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. No complications were recorded in any patients at one- and seven-day follow-up.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Cystic pancreatic lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We studied 10 patients with a cystic pancreatic lesion who underwent EUS-TCB (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F81953\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef81953 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F59882\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59882 \">picture 8</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-trucut-biopsy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The final diagnosis (based upon clinical, laboratory, imaging and biopsy findings, and resected specimens when available) included serous cystadenoma (SCA, five patients), islet cell tumor (two patients), mixed seromucinous lesion (one patient), polycystic disease of the pancreas (one patient), and pseudocyst (one patient). EUS-TCB was non-diagnostic in 3 of 10 patients (one each with a SCA, polycystic disease, and pseudocyst). Among the other seven patients, TCB diagnosed four SCAs, obviating the need for planned surgery in three of the four patients. In the fourth patient with an SCA, the TCB result ruled out metastatic disease from locally recurrent lung cancer, thereby allowing a more narrowed field of radiation. EUS-TCB also confirmed the need for surgery in two patients with an islet cell tumor. In one patient, EUS-TCB findings were suspicious leading to previously unplanned surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Autoimmune pancreatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EUS-FNA is insufficient to diagnose autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) due to the small sample size and lack of tissue architecture. We evaluated five patients in whom the diagnosis was considered; a mean of 2.8 EUS-TCBs (range 2 to 5) was obtained per patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-trucut-biopsy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. TCB specimens were diagnostic of AIP in two patients and were strongly suggestive but not diagnostic in two others. In one patient only nonspecific changes of chronic pancreatitis were seen on histology. EUS-FNA (mean 4.3 passes, range 2 to 7 passes) was performed in four of five patients and failed to establish or suggest the diagnosis in any of these patients. Other than mild transient abdominal pain in one patient, no complications were identified. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">When to avoid EUS-TCB</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EUS-TCB does not appear to have a role in the diagnosis of suspected nonfocal chronic pancreatitis because of complications and limited diagnostic yield [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-ultrasound-guided-trucut-biopsy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We favor trucut biopsy (TCB) often as the initial means of biopsy for submucosal tumors and suspected lymphoma. We favor EUS-TCB over EUS-FNA for evaluation of solid pancreatic mass lesions (in the pancreatic neck, body, and tail that are accessible from the stomach). In patients with a pancreatic cystic lesion or suspected autoimmune pancreatitis, we initially perform TCB, using EUS-FNA when TCB is unsuccessful.</p><p>In all other situations we consider FNA the preferred EUS diagnostic modality. Patient characteristics, endosonographer experience, and available expertise for cytologic and histologic review will influence use of both devices. EUS-FNA and EUS-TCB should not necessarily be regarded as competing modalities, but rather as complimentary.</p><p>While superiority to EUS-FNA has not been clearly demonstrated, EUS-TCB may be more accurate than EUS-FNA in diagnosing submucosal lesions and lymphadenopathy thought to be due to lymphoma or inflammatory conditions. It may also have a role in diagnosis of other lesions where preservation of architectural features is particularly important.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94836220\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We regard any of the following to be absolute contraindications for EUS-TCB:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Location of the target lesion prohibiting biopsy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of intervening structures prohibiting biopsy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uncorrectable coagulopathy (INR &gt;1.5)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uncorrectable thrombocytopenia (platelets &lt;50,000)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An uncooperative patient</p><p/><p>Relative contraindications include a less than ideal location of target lesion making trucut biopsy more difficult and altered anatomy prohibiting access.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Studies suggest greater diagnostic accuracy of endoscopic ultrasound-guided trucut biopsy (EUS-TCB) compared with endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) for submucosal lesions and lymphomas because of the opportunity for histologic review.
