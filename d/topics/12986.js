Premature ovarian failure (POF), now referred to as primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), is defined as primary hypogonadism in a woman under the age of 40 years.</p><p>POI is characterized by loss of oocytes, lack of folliculogenesis and ovarian estrogen production, and infertility. Transient or partial resumption of ovarian activity has been documented in over 50 percent of women with POI based upon hormonal measurements, pelvic ultrasonography, or conception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-causes-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>There are several known causes of ovarian failure, including chromosomal defects like Turner syndrome and fragile X syndrome premutation carriers, exposure to radiation and certain drugs, and autoimmune disease. The list of mutations that can cause ovarian failure has increased rapidly, as discoveries from the human genome project and next-generation sequencing increase our understanding of the factors involved in ovarian development. Unfortunately, the etiology remains unknown in approximately 75 to 90 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-causes-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The pathogenesis and causes of POI will be reviewed here (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F74029\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74029 \">table 1</a>); its evaluation and treatment are discussed separately.

Pathophysiologically, these defects can be divided into two major categories:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Accelerated follicle depletion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased steroid production without oocyte loss</p><p/><p>Other theoretical causes of ovarian failure, including absent germ cell migration or defective ovarian development, have not yet been described, although some genes appear to play a role in normal ovarian development.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H79730714\"><span class=\"h1\">ACCELERATED FOLLICLE DEPLETION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The genetic, autoimmune, and environmental or toxic causes of primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), formerly referred to as premature ovarian failure (POF), often result in accelerated follicle depletion. Complete follicular depletion indicates that there are no remaining primordial follicles in the ovary. For most women, this process is usually complete by approximately age 51 years (the average age of menopause). However, the rate of follicle depletion may be accelerated by a number of genetic disorders and ovarian toxins, resulting in early menopause.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H82311047\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic causes</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2603978545\"><span class=\"h3\">X chromosomome disorders</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h4\">Turner syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lack of a second X chromosome (Turner syndrome) is the most common chromosomal defect in humans, occurring in up to 1.5 percent of conceptions, 10 percent of spontaneous abortions, and 1 of 2500 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-causes-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. It is also one of the most common causes of POI.</p><p>The ovaries in Turner syndrome characteristically consist of small amounts of connective tissue and no follicles or only a few atretic follicles (&quot;streak gonads&quot;). The initial reported cases had extreme forms of this phenotype with absent pubertal development, primary amenorrhea, and multiple morphologic defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-causes-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]; however, the degree of ovarian dysfunction and the extent of the defects are variable. While most affected women have no pubertal development and primary amenorrhea, some develop normally and then have secondary amenorrhea, and some have no morphologic defects and normal stature.</p><p>Early histologic studies of the ovaries of eight XO fetuses are the basis of the understanding of the gonadal failure in Turner syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-causes-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. These ovaries contained apparently normal numbers of primordial germ cells up to at least 12 weeks of gestation, but at later gestational ages, the numbers of germ cells were decreased and connective tissue was increased, as compared with age-matched normal fetuses. These results indicate that the ovarian failure is more likely caused by accelerated atresia than by abnormal germ cell formation. The diagnosis of Turner syndrome is established by karyotypic analysis. This topic is reviewed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Turner syndrome&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H82311058\"><span class=\"h4\">Other X chromosome deletions/translocations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to X monosomy and deletions in the short arm of the X chromosome causing Turner syndrome, X chromosome deletions, inversions, and duplications and balanced X chromosome:autosome translocations are the most common causes of POI. Small deletions and breakpoints in translocated X chromosomes lead to the identification of an X chromosome region critical for ovarian development and function: Xq13 to Xq26 with the exception of Xq22 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-causes-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Unfortunately, mapping the precise location of these breakpoints has not elucidated genes involved in ovarian function, because a gene was not interrupted or the interrupted gene had no link to ovarian function. The exception is diaphanous (<em>DIAPH2</em>), which was identified at a breakpoint in an X chromosome:autosome translocation in a woman with secondary amenorrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-causes-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Mutations in the Drosophila melanogaster diaphanous homolog of <em>DIAPH2</em> disrupt oogenesis and spermatogenesis, supporting a role for <em>DIAPH2</em> in ovarian function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-causes-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h4\">Fragile X syndrome premutation carriers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a strong relationship between age at menopause, including POI, and premutations (defined below) for the fragile X syndrome (the <em>FMR1</em> gene) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-causes-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Fragile X syndrome is an X-linked form of intellectual disability that is one of the most common causes of mental retardation worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-causes-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The genetics of the syndrome are complex. Affected subjects have more than 200 CGG repeats in the 5' untranslated region of the <em>FMR1</em> gene; as a result, a full mutation refers to an allele with more than 200 repeats. Alleles with less than 40 CGG are normal, repeat lengths 40 to 55 are intermediate or &quot;gray zone,&quot; and repeat lengths of 55 to 200 are relatively unstable and called &quot;premutations.&quot; Premutations can expand to a full mutation when transmitted by females with a rate dependent upon the number of repeats. In males, the premutation may stay the same, expand to less than a full mutation, or even regress when transmitted. Of note, the term premutation is defined based on the ability of the repeat to expand to a full mutation in one generation. Some studies suggest that the &quot;gray zone&quot; or intermediate repeat alleles, which may expand to a full mutation over two or more generations, may also be associated with POI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-causes-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>Carriers of the <em>FMR1</em> gene premutation who have repeat lengths of 55 to 200 were originally thought to be unaffected, as they do not have the severe neurodevelopmental problems associated with the full mutation. However, in addition to POI, premutation carriers, particularly males, can present with fragile X-associated tremor-ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) or mild cognitive and behavioral deficits on the spectrum of those seen in fragile X syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-causes-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-spinocerebellar-ataxias#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The spinocerebellar ataxias&quot;, section on 'Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>The percentage of premutation carriers having menopause before the age of 40 years ranges from 12 to 28 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-causes-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The number of CGG repeats within the premutation range appears to influence the timing of menopause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-causes-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The mechanism by which a premutation causes ovarian failure is not known. Subjects with premutations appear to have increased <em>FMR1</em> mRNA expression and decreased but not absent FMR1 protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-causes-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. In comparison, full mutations in mentally retarded subjects are associated with methylation of the <em>FMR1</em> gene and lack of transcription and protein production.</p><p>There is no association between POI and full <em>FMR1</em> mutations (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fragile-x-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-children-and-adolescents#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fragile X syndrome: Clinical features and diagnosis in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>). Therefore, since premutation carriers have a normal amount of protein, the increased levels of mRNA are postulated to cause a toxic effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-causes-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Although early menopause occurs in less than one-third of patients with premutations, the remainder exhibit hormonal changes of early ovarian aging while still experiencing regular menstrual cycles. Women who carry the premutation and have children or relatives affected by fragile X syndrome have an earlier menopause compared with control women, and the age of menopause is dependent on the premutation repeat length [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-causes-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. This was also illustrated in a study of 11 affected women ages 24 to 41 years and 22 age-matched controls who underwent daily blood samples for gonadotropin, sex steroid, and inhibin levels with the following results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-causes-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follicular phase length was significantly shorter in the carriers compared with controls (12.9 versus 14.5 days).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum estradiol concentrations were not different between the groups, but mean follicular phase follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations were higher in the premutation carriers (21.9 versus 11.2 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L)</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhibin B concentrations in the follicular phase and inhibin A and progesterone concentrations in the luteal phase were lower in the premutation carriers compared with controls, changes consistent with ovarian aging.</p><p/><p>A separate issue is the frequency of fragile X premutations in women with sporadic or familial POI, which has been addressed in several studies. The prevalence of <em>FMR1</em> premutations ranges from 2 to 5 percent in women with sporadic POI and from 12 to 14 percent in women with POI with at least one family member who also had menopause before age 40 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-causes-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>]. The frequency of fragile X premutations in normal women is estimated to be approximately 1 in 259 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-causes-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-screening-and-diagnosis-for-fragile-x-syndrome#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal screening and diagnosis for fragile X syndrome&quot;, section on 'Candidates for screening'</a>.)</p><p>Thus, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) now recommends that women with POI or an elevated FSH level before age 40 years without known cause be screened for <em>FMR1</em> premutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-causes-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Although women with POI have relative infertility, many are still actively trying to conceive when the diagnosis of POI is made. Discovering that she may be a carrier for a mental retardation allele (since premutations are unstable) may help these women resolve their decision to become pregnant with their own oocytes. In addition, identification of carrier status is likely to prompt screening of sisters and cousins who are still fertile, and the discovery of fragile X carrier status may exclude a sister as a potential oocyte donor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Somatic chromosomal defects</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H82311137\"><span class=\"h4\">Galactosemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>POI is common in women with galactosemia. Because the hypogonadism cannot be eliminated by early metabolic control, it is thought to be caused by the toxic effects of galactose metabolites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-causes-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], rather than abnormalities in the carbohydrate composition of gonadotropins that reduce their bioactivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-causes-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=galactosemia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Galactosemia: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Even subtle defects in galactose metabolism may have an impact on ovarian function. In a study of 104 normal postmenopausal women, 15 had decreased galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase activity and an abnormal transferase allele by gel electrophoresis; these women had a lower mean age at menopause (45 versus 49 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-causes-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>In contrast, in a second report of 58 pre- and postmenopausal women who were heterozygous for the classical galactosemia mutation, there were no differences in serum markers of ovarian aging (FSH, inhibin B, anti-m&uuml;llerian hormone) or antral follicle count on ultrasound in the 42 premenopausal carriers when compared with a cohort of proven fertile women. In addition, the mean age at menopause in the postmenopausal carriers was 49.7 years, no different from that seen in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-causes-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H394633868\"><span class=\"h3\">Genes important for homologous recombination, DNA damage and repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of new genes have been discovered using whole exome sequencing in consanguineous families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-causes-of-spontaneous-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/34-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-38</a>]. These mutations, which appear to be rare, cause primary amenorrhea associated with POI (XX gonadal dysgenesis).
