The malignant precursor cell(s) can differentiate along one or several lineages, such as muscle, adipose, fibrous, cartilage, nerve, or vascular tissue. These tumors arise most often in the limbs (particularly the lower extremity), followed in order of frequency by the abdominal <span class=\"nowrap\">cavity/retroperitoneum,</span> the <span class=\"nowrap\">trunk/thoracic</span> region, and the head and neck. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-histopathology-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging-of-soft-tissue-sarcoma#H12227086\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, histopathology, diagnostic evaluation, and staging of soft tissue sarcoma&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-histopathology-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging-of-soft-tissue-sarcoma#H12227065\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, histopathology, diagnostic evaluation, and staging of soft tissue sarcoma&quot;, section on 'Introduction'</a>.)</p><p>The classification of STS, insight into their molecular pathogenesis, and the definition of optimal treatment strategies have evolved considerably over the past 10 to 25 years. There are more than 50 histologic subtypes of STS, many of which are associated with distinctive clinical profiles, responses to individual therapies, and prognoses. While in the past these tumors were all &quot;lumped&quot; together and treated similarly, consensus is emerging that the selection of treatment should be histology driven, particularly in the setting of advanced disease.

The pattern of tumor spread varies according to tumor type and location:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most STS of the extremity, chest wall, or head or neck, the primary metastatic site is the lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-of-metastatic-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. However, there are exceptions. Extrapulmonary metastases to the retroperitoneum, spine, and paraspinous soft tissues predominate with <span class=\"nowrap\">myxoid/round</span> cell liposarcomas, although lung metastases develop eventually in almost all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-of-metastatic-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-histopathology-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging-of-soft-tissue-sarcoma#H12227107\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, histopathology, diagnostic evaluation, and staging of soft tissue sarcoma&quot;, section on 'Pattern of spread'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-histopathology-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging-of-soft-tissue-sarcoma#H12227114\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, histopathology, diagnostic evaluation, and staging of soft tissue sarcoma&quot;, section on 'Pattern of recurrence'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With retroperitoneal and visceral sarcomas, the primary site of failure is local. Less commonly, these tumors spread hematogenously to the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-of-metastatic-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spread to locoregional lymph nodes is rare except with clear cell and epithelioid sarcomas, angiosarcomas, synovial sarcomas, and rhabdomyosarcomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-of-metastatic-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Natural history of metastatic disease and implications for treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of patients who develop metastatic<strong> </strong>STS are incurable; however, therapeutic nihilism is unwarranted for the following reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potentially curative options should be sought in appropriate patients so that the opportunity for cure is not overlooked. As an example, in selected patients, resection of pulmonary metastases is feasible, with reported a five-year survival of 25 to 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-of-metastatic-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-treatment-and-other-localized-therapy-for-metastatic-soft-tissue-sarcoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical treatment and other localized therapy for metastatic soft tissue sarcoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with unresectable disease, judicious use of systemic therapy provides meaningful palliation and may prolong survival. The selection of systemic therapy must be individualized and based upon several factors, including the histology and biologic behavior of the disease, as well as the health status and preferences of the patient. (See <a href=\"#H446952322\" class=\"local\">'Overview of the therapeutic approach'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The median survival after development of distant metastases is 12 to 19 months, and 20 to 25 percent of patients with unresectable disease are still alive at two to three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-of-metastatic-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/1,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8,9</a>]. The prognostic factors for more prolonged survival differ from those predicting response to chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-of-metastatic-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], suggesting that survival is more dependent upon disease biology rather than solely upon treatment-associated considerations. This variability in the natural history of metastatic STS can be illustrated by the following reports:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a report in an era before gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) was recognized as a distinct clinical entity, outcomes from over 2000 patients treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy for advanced STS were examined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-of-metastatic-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Median survival was approximately one year for the entire cohort, regardless of the specific regimen used. The likelihood of a chemotherapy response was greater in younger patients with high-grade non-leiomyosarcoma histology and no hepatic metastases, while longer median survival was predicted by a good performance status, low-grade histology, the absence of liver metastases, and a longer recurrence-free interval.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a more modern series, 488 patients were treated with first-line chemotherapy for advanced <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> metastatic STS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-of-metastatic-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In multivariate analysis, age &lt;40 years, liposarcoma or synovial sarcoma histology, lack of bone metastases, and combination, rather than single agent, therapy were associated with a better outcome.</p><p/><p>These principles can be applied to therapeutic decision making. As an example, for some patients with asymptomatic, low-grade, unresectable disease (eg, low-grade intraabdominal leiomyosarcoma), it might be reasonable to follow the patient without active chemotherapy. Conversely, for patients with a high-grade chemotherapy-sensitive tumor, such as synovial sarcoma or myxoid round cell liposarcoma, early use of combination chemotherapy may be preferable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">End points to define benefit</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unresectable metastatic STS is, with rare exception, a fatal disease eventually. A few patients may enter a prolonged remission. However, for the majority of patients with metastatic STS, chemotherapy is administered with palliative intent to decrease tumor bulk, diminish symptoms, improve quality of life, and prolong survival.</p><p>The specific endpoints that best reflect benefit from systemic therapy in metastatic STS remain unclear. Objective response rates, as judged by a decrease in the size of measurable lesions, are increasingly considered to be poor surrogates for benefit in this family of cancers. Even in cases where systemic treatment successfully induces massive tumor cell kill in vivo, hyalinized acellular tissue remains, leading to a falsely negative assessment of the true response to treatment and an underestimation of antitumor efficacy. The &quot;disconnect&quot; between objective tumor response and disease stabilization is particularly evident in studies of drugs like <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trabectedin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trabectedin</a> and molecularly targeted therapies.</p><p>Increasing attention is being paid to other important indicators of clinical outcomes, such as progression-free survival, the progression-free rate at a specific time point (often 12 weeks), percentage survival at a given time point, overall survival, and disease stabilization. A therapeutic agent that is associated with a low objective antitumor response may slow tumor progression and prolong survival. Stabilization of disease is increasingly viewed as a realistic endpoint for metastatic STS. However, the generation of clinical and radiologic data to support these alternative endpoints requires rigorous attention to the consistency of follow-up.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3430831444\"><span class=\"h2\">Histology-driven treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most studies of chemotherapy for metastatic STS have been hampered by the admixture of a variety of histologic subtypes in the analysis of outcome, making it difficult to assess the clinical activity of any given treatment in a specific histology. The interpretation of clinical trial results will be heavily weighted by the distribution of histologic subtypes. This, in turn, complicates the assessment of chemotherapy efficacy, making it impossible to determine whether high or low response rates are due to the specific treatment or to the specific population under study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-of-metastatic-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>These data have led to the emergence of the concept of histology-driven treatment rather than the &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach to therapy in patients with metastatic STS. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Synovial sarcomas and <span class=\"nowrap\">myxoid/round</span> cell liposarcomas are among the more chemotherapy-sensitive subtypes when specific agents are used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-of-metastatic-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. In particular, <span class=\"nowrap\">myxoid/round</span> cell liposarcomas tend to be sensitive to doxorubicin-based chemotherapy, and synovial sarcoma appears especially sensitive to alkylating agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ifosfamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ifosfamide</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-of-metastatic-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In contrast, other subtypes, such as clear cell sarcoma and fibromyxoid sarcoma (Evans tumor), appear to have lower response rates to conventional anthracycline and ifosfamide-based chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-of-metastatic-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/8,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,16</a>]. GISTs are well recognized for the inactivity of standard cytotoxic agents. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leiomyosarcomas and liposarcomas (particularly <span class=\"nowrap\">myxoid/round</span> cell liposarcomas) appear to be sensitive to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trabectedin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trabectedin</a>, and liposarcomas are also sensitive to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eribulin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eribulin</a>.

Furthermore, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sunitinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sunitinib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pazopanib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pazopanib</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-of-metastatic-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], and other multitargeted VEGF receptor inhibitors seem to be active agents for alveolar soft part sarcoma. The approval of pazopanib for advanced STS lends some evidence to the possibly important role of VEGF receptor and related pathways in the growth of other sarcoma subtypes, although the specific relevant targets in these diseases are not well elucidated. (See <a href=\"#H8828453\" class=\"local\">'Pazopanib'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>However, for most STS tumor types, the notion of histology-driven treatment is now a consideration for second-line therapy and beyond, given the approval of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olaratumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olaratumab</a> in combination with an anthracycline for first-line therapy of anthracycline-sensitive histologies.

As noted below, the standard of care for many years for symptomatic patients has been doxorubicin plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ifosfamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ifosfamide</a>, with single-agent doxorubicin being considered for asymptomatic patients or for those patients thought unlikely to tolerate combination therapy. The accelerated approval of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olaratumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olaratumab</a> in 2016 as a first-line agent in combination with doxorubicin has resulted in the first change in strategy for first-line therapy of metastatic STS in many years, since the toxicity of doxorubicin and olaratumab is considered less than that of doxorubicin and ifosfamide. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Doxorubicin-based regimens'</a> below and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Doxorubicin'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a good performance status and an STS histology that is known to have at least some sensitivity to anthracyclines, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olaratumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olaratumab</a> represents a first-line standard of care off-study.

This drug has a relatively narrow therapeutic index; even small variations of dose beyond 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> can drastically worsen patient tolerance, and even 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> is considered by many patients to be significantly more toxic than 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span>.

Other methods to diminish cardiotoxicity include the concomitant use of the cardioprotectant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexrazoxane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexrazoxane</a> or the use of liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin.

The most widely used preparation (Doxil in the United States and Caelyx in Europe) is a large liposome with polyethylene glycol (PEG) anchored within the lipid bilayer, which acts as a hydrophilic coating to prolong the circulating half-life of the liposome by preventing degradation within the reticuloendothelial system. The toxicity profile is somewhat different from nonencapsulated doxorubicin, mainly consisting of an acute hypersensitivity-like reaction, in approximately 8 percent of patients, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (&quot;hand-foot syndrome&quot;), and esophagitis.

Although Doxil was well tolerated and appeared to have similar efficacy compared with doxorubicin, the response rates in both arms were low, 10 and 9 percent, respectively. Of note, there was a high proportion of gastrointestinal stomal tumor (GIST) in this study population, emphasizing the importance of disease subtype as a confounding factor in studies of chemotherapy efficacy.

In a preliminary report presented at the 2017 ASCO annual meeting, treatment-linked alterations known to respond to FDA-approved or study drugs were identified in 16 and 7 percent of patients, respectively, and 42 percent had a treatment-linked alteration that was eligible for MATCH, TAPUR, or another trial.

The primary utility of next-generation sequencing in metastatic STS is to identify potential clinical trial candidates. As an example, a subset of pediatric and adult STS has gene fusions involving one of the neurotrophic tropomyosin receptor kinase (<em>NTRK</em>) genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/systemic-treatment-of-metastatic-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/184,185\" class=\"abstract_t\">184,185</a>].

While in the past these tumors were all &quot;lumped&quot; together and treated similarly, consensus is emerging that the selection of treatment should be histology driven, particularly in the setting of advanced disease. (See <a href=\"#H3430831444\" class=\"local\">'Histology-driven treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical resection of metastatic disease can provide long-term relapse-free survival and perhaps cure in selected patients, the majority of whom have isolated pulmonary metastatic disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-treatment-and-other-localized-therapy-for-metastatic-soft-tissue-sarcoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical treatment and other localized therapy for metastatic soft tissue sarcoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>However, for the majority of patients with metastatic STS, chemotherapy is administered with palliative intent, with the goals of decreasing tumor bulk, diminishing symptoms, improving quality of life, and prolonging survival. Objective response rates, as judged by a decrease in the size of measurable lesions, are increasingly considered to be poor surrogates for benefit in metastatic STS. The &quot;disconnect&quot; between objective tumor response and disease stabilization is particularly evident in studies of drugs like <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trabectedin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trabectedin</a> and molecularly targeted therapies. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'End points to define benefit'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The natural history of patients with unresectable metastatic disease is variable and is more dependent on disease biology than treatment. For some patients with asymptomatic, low-grade, unresectable disease (eg, low-grade intraabdominal leiomyosarcoma), it might be reasonable to follow the patient without active chemotherapy. Conversely, for patients with a high-grade chemotherapy-sensitive tumor, such as synovial sarcoma or liposarcoma, early use of combination chemotherapy may be preferable. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Natural history of metastatic disease and implications for treatment'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with advanced unresectable STS are appropriate candidates for clinical trials to identify more active single agents, combinations, or novel approaches. If participation in clinical trials is not feasible, conventional systemic therapy is an appropriate option for selected patients. The following represents our general approach to advanced, unresectable, non-uterine, non-gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) STS. Treatment of patients with advanced uterine leiomyosarcoma and GIST is discussed separately.
