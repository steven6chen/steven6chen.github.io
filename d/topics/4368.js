Although CRPS was first reported in 1864 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], it was not until 1971 that CRPS was described in a child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Since the initial pediatric report, CRPS is increasingly recognized in pediatric pain, rheumatology, and neurology clinics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-children/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of CRPS in children are reviewed here.

CRPS that follows trauma usually starts within days or sometimes a few weeks in the healing phase of the injury. In one retrospective series of 78 children with CRPS, the average time between injury and onset of CRPS was 0.57 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of the central nervous system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data supporting the role of the CNS in the pathogenesis and spread of pain in CRPS include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In adults, magnetoencephalography demonstrates extensive reorganization of the S1 cortex on the contralateral side of the affected limb, which is reversed once the pain subsides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in children demonstrates changes in basal ganglia and parietal lobe activation that persist even after CRPS resolution and findings suggestive of pain-induced activation of the endogenous pain modulatory system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CNS involvement is suggested by hemisensory impairment beyond the painful area and the increased frequency of mechanical allodynia (pain produced normally by non-noxious stimulation) and movement disorders with sensory deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Psychologic issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psychologic stress and other comorbid psychologic disorders are commonly reported in pediatric CRPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-children/abstract/5,11,15,23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,11,15,23-25</a>]. It is unclear whether these psychologic disorders are due to CNS factors that play a role in the etiology of CRPS or the result of the stress and anxiety related to CRPS.</p><p>Children with CRPS are often described as overly mature, with an incongruent affect (eg, cheerful appearance while reporting severe pain). In addition, conversion symptoms are not uncommon. The author has cared for children with CRPS who have developed conversional nonepileptic seizures, blindness, paralysis, conversion gait, muscle spasms (both stiff limbs or movement disorders), and incapacitating dizziness. Other psychologic conditions seen in children with CRPS include disordered eating, suicidal gestures, and self-injury (such as cutting) behavior. Data from the author's center suggest that children with the highest rate of a second occurrence are those who have a prior suicide attempt.

In a population study of Olmsted County, the overall risk of CRPS was 5.46 per 100,000 person-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, this mainly reflected adult CRPS as the median age at diagnosis was 46 years. Although there appears to be an increase in identified pediatric cases, it is unclear whether this is due to an increase in the incidence of CRPS or improved detection.</p><p>In a large pediatric series, CRPS is more common in girls (70 percent), and the mean age at diagnosis is 13 years of age (range of 5 to 17 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-children/abstract/6,7,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,11</a>]. Although the youngest reported child with CRPS was two years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], CRPS is unusual under the age of seven years.</p><p>Most children who have developed CRPS postimmunization have been between 11 and 13 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-children/abstract/19,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,30,31</a>]. CRPS usually occurs within minutes to hours of immunization. It is possible that the immunization is causal. Alternatively, the development of CRPS may be related to the injury associated with the needle jab. However, studies have not shown an association between CRPS and immunization in younger children who receive many more vaccine injections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CRPS is defined as pain that is out of proportion to the history and physical findings of the patient and is associated with at least one sign of autonomic dysfunction.

However, a normal radiograph does not entirely exclude the presence of a fracture. In some patients, radiographs may show evidence of osteoporosis in the later stages of CRPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-children/abstract/4,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,33</a>].</p><p>In children with CRPS, technetium bone scintigraphy usually shows decrease uptake, but a spotty increased pattern may be seen (the pattern more common in adult CRPS) or the study may be normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-children/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. A normal bone scan excludes osteomyelitis, osteoid osteoma, or a stress fracture, but it does not exclude the diagnosis of CRPS. An abnormal scan is also subject to differing interpretations, especially if the findings are subtle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-children/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Magnetic resonance scans in children with CRPS can show bony edema and small joint effusions, but it is difficult to distinguish these findings from trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-children/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Such edema should not dissuade one from the diagnosis of CRPS if the history is not suggestive of trauma, the clinical findings are typical of CRPS, or the duration is such that trauma should be healed.</p><p>Ultrasound should only be performed in patients in whom a diagnosis of thrombus is highly suspected as the cause of pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Other studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the clinical diagnosis of CRPS is made, it is counterproductive to do further studies as they delay treatment and put doubts about the diagnosis in the mind of the patient and family.

Both groups showed improvement in the five outcome measures of pain and physical functioning at a mean follow-up of 10 weeks. Excellent functional outcome was reported in 21 of the 24 patients who participated in long-term follow-up (mean 2.5 years). The study sample was too small to determine whether the frequency of sessions had an effect on outcome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychologic and behavioral therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there are no clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness of psychologic and behavioral therapy, these interventions are generally used based upon observational reports of their beneficial effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-children/abstract/6,7,28,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,28,43</a>].</p><p>Psychologic and behavioral therapeutic interventions include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relaxation training</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biofeedback</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognitive-behavioral therapy to improve stress management</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family intervention to eliminate reinforcement of negative behaviors (avoidance of school or social obligations)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family intervention to promote coping techniques</p><p/><p>These interventions are probably helpful because they decrease the stress and anxiety that commonly occur in these children and their families.

In that study, patients showed modest improvement with both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">gabapentin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">amitriptyline</a>, but no difference was seen between these agents, perhaps indicating regression to mean [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-children/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In addition, there are no trials comparing intensive physical therapy alone or in combination with a pharmacologic agent. As a result, the role of pharmacologic agents in the treatment of children with CRPS remains uncertain and controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Some experts, including the author, advocate only intensive physical therapy without medications because of the potential of drug side effects and lack of clear benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-children/abstract/6,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,47</a>]. Although some case reports or small series report beneficial effects of medications such as gabapentin, amitriptyline, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxcarbazepine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">oxcarbazepine</a>, the efficacy of these medications has not been confirmed in clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-children/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>]. Glucocorticoid therapy was not effective in reducing the symptoms of CRPS in one small case series of six children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Medications are more commonly used in adults with CRPS. This is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-adults-prevention-and-management#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complex regional pain syndrome in adults: Prevention and management&quot;, section on 'Pharmacologic approaches'</a>.)</p><p>There is no role for opioids in children with CRPS. The evidence for the use of opioids in adults with neuropathic pain is equivocal at best [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-children/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>], and their side effects far outweigh their uncertain benefit in children with CRPS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain-reducing procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no randomized trials to support the use of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), regional sympathetic nerve block, epidural and intrathecal anesthetics, sympathectomy, or amputation in children with CRPS, and their risks probably outweigh their benefits in most cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-children/abstract/7,18,47,48,52-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,18,47,48,52-57</a>]. Based upon the author's experience, none of these procedures are indicated in the vast majority of children with CRPS.</p><p>These procedures are discussed in greater detail separately in adults with CRPS.

The goals of therapy are the return and maintenance of full functionality and to provide the child with the necessary tools to deal with pain, especially when and if there is a recurrence of the disease.</p><p>Treatment is most effective when coupled with patient and family education. The earlier one starts treatment, the less the child suffers. However, outcomes are associated with psychologic variables (attempted suicide and disordered eating portended subsequent episodes), not duration of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. There has been an increase in the medicalization of these children over time, which can increase the risk of iatrogenic injury and burden families with additional medical costs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-children/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>The management approach is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Education</strong> &ndash; A complete explanation of CRPS is provided to the patient and family. This includes acknowledging the existence of real pain but that the pain does not signify damage even though it is at times severe (amplified). The most effective therapy, based upon the author's experience, is to use the affected limb despite pain and desensitizing techniques if allodynia is present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Physical and occupational therapy</strong> &ndash; A home exercise and desensitization regimen is developed for each individual and encourages the patient to use the affected limb as much as possible. The regimen's goals are 45 minutes of daily aerobic activities and 5 to 10 minute blocks of desensitization (ie, rubbing, brushing, patting, and clothing) performed multiple times throughout the day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If, after four to eight weeks, the patient is not making significant progress, <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> is admitted to a more intense daily physical and occupational therapy program of five to six hours focused on restoring function regardless of pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-children/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Patients are treated in the ambulatory setting with one-on-one supervision. Parents are not allowed in the gym. Parents are encouraged to return to their normal daily routine and take care of their own needs. If there are significant psychologic issues, patients are admitted to the inpatient service for more in-depth behavioral and psychologic intervention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Psychologic and behavioral therapy</strong> &ndash; All children and their families undergo psychologic screening to detect any undue stress and comorbid psychologic conditions. Patients with significant psychologic issues are referred to a pediatric psychologist or psychiatrist.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients who require the intense physical and occupational program also have scheduled twice-weekly sessions (more if indicated) that address any psychologic issues (&quot;talk time&quot;), as well as music and art therapy sessions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medications</strong> &ndash; Any medications for pain are stopped or, if needed, are tapered. No further diagnostic tests are ordered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sleep interventions</strong> &ndash; Sleep disturbances are managed by nonpharmacologic sleep hygiene recommendations. These include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>No caffeine beverages.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>No television or radio in the bedroom.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Set bedtime and get up times.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Darken room.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>No exercise two hours prior to bedtime.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the child is unable to fall asleep within 30 minutes, <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> is allowed to get up and do a quiet, boring activity without disturbing <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> parents.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>School work and transition</strong> &ndash; Patients who require a more intense physical and occupational therapy regimen are not expected to do school work during this time period. However, academic accommodations and resources are allowed so patients can makeup work prior to their return to school. In the transition back to school, any physical accommodations (eg, use of elevator and increase time between classes) are eliminated since the children are functional. In children with residual pain, accommodations enable and perpetuate their disability. Academic testing is helpful in identifying previously unidentified or unaddressed learning difficulties in some children that can greatly increase the stress of school [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although many centers have a multidisciplinary team addressing the needs of these children, pediatric CRPS may be managed in the community with the help of a local physical therapist and psychologist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unlike adults, there is no intervention to prevent the first episode of CRPS in children, because pediatric CRPS is uncommon and rarely occurs after bony fractures. In older adults, daily supplementation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-c-ascorbic-acid-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vitamin C</a> following a wrist fracture has been associated with a decrease in the incidence of CRPS from 10 to 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-children/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Based upon these findings, the author prescribes vitamin C to children with CRPS if they have a fracture, require surgery, or have a significant soft tissue injury.

The psychologic aspects of a second episode must be addressed in affected children as these children are more likely to develop other stress-related conditions, such as non-limb pain (eg, headache or abdominal pain), self-injury, eating disorders, school avoidance, or conversion symptoms. The children at greater risk of a subsequent episode had more psychologic issues at presentation (ie, prior suicide attempts and eating disorders) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complex-regional-pain-syndrome-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

(See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CRPS is more common in girls, and the mean age of presentation is 13 years of age. CRPS is unusual below seven years of age. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical manifestation of CRPS include pain, autonomic dysfunction, sleep disturbances, and psychologic stress and dysfunction. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain typically presents in a single lower extremity. Most patients experience allodynia (pain due to normally non-noxious stimulation) and are unable to tolerate light touch or clothing on the limb. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Pain'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One or more signs of autonomic dysfunction are present in the affected limb, which include decreased skin temperature, cyanosis, edema, or increased sweating. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Autonomic dysfunction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychologic stress and dysfunction are common in children with CRPS and their families. Other psychologic conditions seen in children with CRPS include conversion reactions, school avoidance, eating disorders, and self-injury behavior. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Psychologic findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CRPS is diagnosed clinically based upon the presence of pain out of proportion to the history and physical findings and one finding of autonomic dysfunction. There are no laboratory studies that confirm or exclude CRPS. Laboratory evaluation is primarily performed to exclude other conditions that may present with extremity pain including trauma (eg, fracture), inflammatory conditions (eg, osteomyelitis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis), and tumors (eg, osteosarcoma). (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment goals are restoration of function and relief of pain. If pain cannot be totally limited, the goal shifts to helping the child cope with pain while maintaining function. Management of pediatric CRPS is challenging because there is no proven definitive treatment and the disease course varies with unpredictable and sometimes rapid remission of symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children with CRPS, treatment options include physical and occupational therapy, psychotherapy, pharmacologic therapy, and pain-reducing procedures. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest physical and occupational therapy as initial therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest the addition of psychologic and behavioral therapy as these measures address the stress and anxiety that commonly occur in affected patients and their families (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We do not suggest pharmacologic therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). There are no data that medications provide additional benefit over nonpharmacologic measures, and they have potential severe side effects.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain-reducing procedures are usually not necessary; however, they may have a role in those patients that are refractory to therapy. These procedures should be used for discrete finite trials, not prolonged treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no measures to prevent pediatric CRPS, because it is uncommon in children and rarely occurs after bony fractures. (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of children with CRPS have a favorable outcome with restored function of the affected limb.
