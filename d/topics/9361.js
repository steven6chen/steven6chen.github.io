The clinical presentation is varied and often includes symptoms related to organ dysfunction caused by occlusion of blood vessels. Particularly in the past, the diagnosis was usually only recognized at autopsy. In recent years, the heightened awareness of ILCL has resulted in more patients being diagnosed during life, thereby allowing for treatment.</p><p>Most information on ILCL comes from case reports and small case series of patients. In addition, an expert panel of pathologists and clinicians, convened under the sponsorship of the International Extranodal Lymphoma Study Group, has proposed practical guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravascular-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of ILCL will be discussed here. Other types of large cell lymphoma are presented separately.

The clinical presentation appears to differ by country of origin, although individual presentations vary tremendously and virtually any organ can be involved:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In Western countries, patients present most commonly with symptoms related to involvement of the central nervous system (39 to 76 percent) and skin (17 to 39 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravascular-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]. Fever, skin lesions, and prominent, rapidly progressive neurologic signs (eg, dementia, progressive cerebral vascular accident, peripheral neuropathy) are frequent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravascular-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/2,5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5-7</a>]. Less commonly involved tissues include the bone marrow (32 percent), spleen (26 percent), and liver (26 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravascular-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In Asia, neurological symptoms (27 percent) and cutaneous lesions (15 percent) are less common than in Western countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravascular-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Patients frequently present with involvement of the bone marrow (75 percent), spleen (67 percent), and liver (55 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravascular-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/3,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9-11</a>]. Hemophagocytic syndrome, a condition stemming from systemic macrophage activation that is associated with B symptoms and the hemophagocytosis of red cells, white blood cells, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> platelets, can be seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravascular-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>There is a cutaneous variant of ILCL that presents with symptoms limited to the skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravascular-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This variant is seen more frequently in Western countries (24 percent) and is rare in Asia (3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravascular-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Patients are mostly younger females with good performance status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravascular-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Skin lesions are most commonly nodules, plaques, or macules of red to grayish-blue color on the leg (35 percent), thigh (41 percent), and trunk (31 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravascular-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Telangiectases, edema, and pain are often seen concomitantly, making it difficult to differentiate cutaneous ILCL from inflammatory skin diseases such as thrombophlebitis or erythema nodosum. To date, no criteria enable clinical distinction between ILCL restricted to the skin and skin lesions concurrent with ILCL in other organs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients often present with the following laboratory abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravascular-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/1,2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), beta-2 microglobulin, elevated sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Altered hepatic, renal, or thyroid function</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum monoclonal protein</p><p/><p>Patients from Western countries and Asian countries differ in their rates of thrombocytopenia (29 versus 76 percent) and hypoalbuminemia (18 versus 84 percent).</p><p>Anti-proteinase-3-anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) have been reported in patients with intravascular lymphoma (which may be related to endothelial damage), but this finding may delay the diagnosis of ILCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravascular-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Involved tissues demonstrate neoplastic lymphoid cells lodged in the capillaries and post-capillary venules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F62103\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62103 \">picture 1</a>). Malignant cells also may be found, albeit rarely, in cerebrospinal fluid or peripheral blood; bone marrow involvement varies with geographic location [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravascular-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Like other subtypes of large cell lymphoma, the morphology varies; most often the lymphoid cells are large in size, have vesicular nuclei and prominent nucleoli (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81094\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81094 \">picture 2</a>). Frequent mitotic figures are seen. Ki-67 staining demonstrates high proliferative activity. Immunophenotyping usually identifies the cells to be mature B cells; such cases can be considered an intravascular variant of diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Rare cases of ILCL are of T cell or NK cell origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravascular-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. A subset of the cases associated with hemophagocytic syndrome is positive for Epstein-Barr virus infection. An intravascular gamma-delta T cell lymphoma has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravascular-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Vessels containing lymphoma cells may be very few in number and can be located anywhere in the skin and subcutaneous tissue.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of ILCL is made by identifying large lymphoma cells within small to medium blood vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravascular-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>When the diagnosis is suspected, biopsies of involved skin, senile hemangiomata (if present), or random biopsies of apparently normal skin may be diagnostic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravascular-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/20-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-28</a>]. Deep skin biopsies must be performed because involved blood vessels are mostly in the subcutaneous fat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravascular-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The yield from random skin biopsies is controversial, but some experts advocate that random skin biopsies should include at least three specimens (from both thighs and abdomen) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravascular-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/27,29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,29-31</a>].</p><p>Other sites may be biopsied if skin biopsies are non-diagnostic, especially if there is evidence of organ dysfunction. Case reports describe diagnostic specimens from liver, lung, and brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravascular-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/1,20,24,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,20,24,32</a>]. Although commonly involved in other subtypes of lymphoma, bone marrow, lymph nodes, peripheral blood, and cerebrospinal fluid are often uninvolved in ILCL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravascular-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Involvement of these sites can be subtle, and stains for lymphoid markers (eg, CD20) may detect rare tumor cells within small vessels that are missed by morphology alone. As discussed above, bone marrow involvement is more frequent in the so-called Asian variant of ILCL. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p>Immunophenotyping of intravascular lymphoid cells is required to distinguish intravascular large B cell lymphoma (ILBL) from less common ILCL with T cells or NK cells. The rare <span class=\"nowrap\">NK/T</span> cell phenotype (positive for CD2, CD3, CD56 and cytotoxic proteins such as granzyme B, and negative for CD20, CD4, CD8, CD5) reveals lymphoma cells that are positive for Epstein-Barr virus antigens and usually takes an aggressive course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravascular-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On occasion, clusters of activated lymphocytes may be observed within the post-capillary venules of tissues involved in inflammatory or immune reactions, particularly the lymph nodes. On purely morphologic grounds, these may be difficult to distinguish from focal involvement by ILCL. As noted above, however, most patients with ILCL have systemic constitutional symptoms, laboratory abnormalities, and evidence of organ dysfunction, all of which are typically associated with extensive intravascular disease in extranodal organs, allowing for the diagnosis to be established on clinicopathologic grounds. </p><p>Intralymphatic histiocytosis is a reactive condition of macrophages associated with rheumatoid arthritis that may present with clinical lesions similar to those of ILCL and with intravascular proliferations of large cells. Intralymphatic histiocytosis can be differentiated from ILCL by immunophenotyping, which will demonstrate expression of macrophage-specific markers (eg, CD68) and absence of lymphoid markers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravascular-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Recently, a benign atypical intravascular CD30+ T cell proliferation was described, in which CD30+ polyclonal T cells (Epstein-Barr virus negative) are found within lymphatics in close vicinity to ulceration or an inflammatory skin disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravascular-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">PRETREATMENT EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pretreatment evaluation both determines the extent of the disease and provides information about the individual's comorbidities that are likely to have impact on treatment options. In general, the pretreatment evaluation is the same as that performed for patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma. This is presented in detail separately. Of note, patients with intravascular large B cell lymphoma have a high rate of central nervous system involvement. As such, we typically evaluate the central nervous system with a lumbar puncture and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of advanced stage diffuse large B cell lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Pretreatment evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of patients with ILCL includes both systemic therapy and therapy directed at the central nervous system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Due to the presence of lymphoma cells within the blood vessels, all cases of ILCL are considered disseminated and are therefore treated as advanced disease. Only case reports and retrospective analyses have been reported on the treatment of ILCL. Most patients diagnosed with intravascular large B cell lymphoma (ILBL) are treated with regimens used for the treatment of diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Specifically, a combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> with the recombinant anti-CD20 antibody <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> (R-CHOP) is the most commonly employed treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F63586\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63586 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of advanced stage diffuse large B cell lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Anthracycline-based chemotherapy (eg, CHOP, CHOP-R) can achieve response rates in &gt;60 percent and estimated three-year overall survival &gt;30 percent; long-term survival appears to be possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravascular-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/1,2,4,5,22,38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,4,5,22,38-41</a>].</p><p>Support for the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> plus anthracycline-based chemotherapy comes from case reports and retrospective studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravascular-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/1,2,4,22,38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,4,22,38-41</a>]. The largest retrospective analysis of treatment included 106 patients with newly diagnosed ILBL treated either with chemotherapy alone (57 patients) or chemotherapy plus rituximab (49 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravascular-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Approximately 83 percent of the patients received CHOP or CHOP-like chemotherapy with or without rituximab. There was no difference in the rate of treatment-related deaths. At a median follow-up of 18 months, patients treated with chemotherapy plus rituximab had significantly higher rates of:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete response (82 versus 51 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two-year progression-free survival (56 versus 27 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two-year overall survival (66 versus 46 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">CNS directed therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Central nervous system (CNS) involvement is seen in 30 to 40 percent of patients with ILBL at diagnosis and occurs in another 25 percent of patients during follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravascular-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Systemic therapy with R-CHOP does not sufficiently penetrate the CNS, therefore patients with ILBL also require therapies directed towards the CNS, either as prophylaxis for or treatment of CNS involvement. As mentioned above, the pretreatment evaluation includes a lumbar puncture and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. CNS-directed therapy is determined based on the results of these tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients without tumor cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and normal imaging by MRI, we administer CNS prophylaxis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-secondary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of secondary central nervous system lymphoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-prognosis-and-prophylaxis-of-secondary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment, prognosis, and prophylaxis of secondary central nervous system lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with secondary involvement of the brain or spinal cord at the time of diagnosis, we administer specific treatment targeting these areas. Such treatment varies based on the exact disease site, but can include intrathecal chemotherapy, systemic high dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation to the sites of involvement. The treatment of CNS involvement is presented in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-secondary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of secondary central nervous system lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Patients with neurologic compromise from spinal cord compression require urgent therapy. The timing of chemotherapy and radiation therapy is controversial; however, many patients are treated with radiation therapy prior to receiving systemic therapy. The benefit of intrathecal therapy, particularly in the presence of a normal spinal fluid evaluation, is unclear. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of neoplastic epidural spinal cord compression, including cauda equina syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION OF RESPONSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One month following the completion of planned therapy (or sooner if the outcome is unfavorable), the response to treatment should be documented by history, physical examination, and laboratory studies (complete blood count, lactate dehydrogenase, and biochemical profile). <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> should be obtained six to eight weeks after completion of chemotherapy and 12 weeks after the completion of radiation therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravascular-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>]. <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> imaging obtained earlier than this is likely to demonstrate increased uptake due to an inflammatory reaction to treatment.</p><p>Given its unusual initial presentation and location of disease, the response criteria used for other types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma may not apply. Instead, prospective studies have used the following criteria for response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravascular-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete response &ndash; Disappearance of all clinical symptoms and radiographic or laboratory abnormalities, including bone marrow involvement, observed at diagnosis and the absence of any new abnormalities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progressive disease &ndash; Appearance of new abnormalities associated with the disease or evident deterioration of the initial abnormalities associated with the disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stable disease &ndash; Failure to achieve a complete response and lack of progressive disease.</p><p/><p>Relapsed disease occurs when there is progression of the disease after an initial complete response.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although follow-up data are scarce, relapses may be more common in those with central nervous system involvement and less common in those with cutaneous involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravascular-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. When the disease is restricted to the skin, the prognosis seems to be favorable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intravascular-large-cell-lymphoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Following the completion of therapy, restaging, and documentation of complete remission, patients are seen at periodic intervals to monitor for treatment complications and assess for possible relapse. The frequency and extent of these visits depends on the comfort of both the patient and physician. There have been no prospective, randomized trials comparing various schedules of follow-up. When planning the post-treatment surveillance strategy, care should be taken to limit the number of CT scans, particularly in younger individuals, given concerns about radiation exposure and the risk for second malignancies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-related-risks-of-imaging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation-related risks of imaging&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Our approach to patient surveillance is to schedule patient visits every three months during the first year, every three to six months during the second year, and every six months starting two years after complete response. At these visits we perform a history and physical examination, complete blood count, chemistries, and lactate dehydrogenase. We do perform CT scans at months 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 or 36, and then yearly until five years after attainment of a complete remission. No more imaging is performed after five years unless an abnormality suggests the possibility relapse or the patient requests it.</p><p>Relapsed disease can be suggested by changes on imaging studies but can only be confirmed by biopsy. As such, a biopsy should always be obtained to document relapsed disease before proceeding to salvage therapy.
