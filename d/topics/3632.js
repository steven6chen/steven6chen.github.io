Grading the symptoms of ischemia and the anatomic lesions responsible for these symptoms provides objective measures by which to follow patients clinically, and, importantly, provides consistency when comparing medical and interventional treatment strategies in clinical studies. For patients who suffer from symptoms related to peripheral artery disease (PAD), impairment and disability may need to be quantified for insurance purposes, or in order to qualify for a disability program. </p><p>Classification schemes that are useful in guiding management of acute and chronic lower extremity ischemia are reviewed here. The clinical diagnosis and treatment of claudication and critical limb ischemia are discussed elsewhere.

The common femoral artery branches into the superficial and deep femoral arteries a short distance inferior to the inguinal ligament. The superficial femoral artery runs anteriorly down the thigh between the adductor and quadriceps muscles within the anterior compartment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F72956\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72956 \">figure 2</a>). In the distal third of the femur, the superficial femoral artery is in close proximity to the femur. The superficial femoral artery passes through the adductor canal to become the popliteal artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77245\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77245 \">picture 1</a>), which most commonly divides at the level of the tibial tuberosity into the anterior tibial artery and tibioperoneal trunk, which further divides into the posterior tibial and peroneal arteries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54800%7EEM%2F65590\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54800 graphicRef65590 \">picture 2A-B</a>). The anterior tibial artery accompanies the deep peroneal (fibular) nerve along the posterior margin of the tibia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F68629\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68629 \">figure 3</a>). The peroneal artery passes adjacent to the medial margin of the fibula throughout its course distally. The posterior tibial artery is accompanied by the tibial nerve within the deep posterior compartment. </p><p>The collateral circulation in the lower extremity is derived from the deep femoral artery (profunda femoris) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F72956\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72956 \">figure 2</a>). Collaterals are poorly developed in younger patients, who thus tend to develop severe acute ischemia with disruption of arterial continuity at the femoral or popliteal levels. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1576665376\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMIC LESION CLASSIFICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H909629056\"><span class=\"h2\">TASC classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arterial lesions can be classified by Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC II) as Type A, B, C, or D according to anatomic distribution, number and nature of lesions (stenosis, occlusion), and according to the overall success rates of treating the lesion using endovascular or surgical means [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-acute-and-chronic-lower-extremity-ischemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In general, short segments of disease are more likely to be successfully treated with an endovascular intervention compared with long segments of occlusion forming the basis of the classification. However, most patients with peripheral artery disease have more than one lesion, at more than one level, so this classification scheme is limited in focusing on singular patterns. Scoring systems that take into account multifocal disease have been used predominantly in research studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-acute-and-chronic-lower-extremity-ischemia/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1576665412\" class=\"local\">'Bollinger scoring method'</a> below.)</p><p>The original TASC I classification included classifications for aortoiliac, femoropopliteal, and tibial vessel runoff. Tibial disease was omitted from TASC II. A new tibial classification system has been proposed by selected former TASC steering committee members; this proposed system considers tibial stenosis length, lesion number, presence of occlusion, density of calcification, and nonvisualization of collaterals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-acute-and-chronic-lower-extremity-ischemia/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].

The WIfI threatened limb classification has been validated in multiple studies to date in over 4100 patients and seems to provide a pragmatic means to assess the likelihood of wound healing and amputation risk in patients with a spectrum of chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-acute-and-chronic-lower-extremity-ischemia/abstract/12-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-17</a>]. </p><p>The Rutherford and Fontaine classifications, which are decades old, were designed to classify chronic limb ischemia among patients with pure ischemia due to peripheral artery disease (PAD); however, due to marked demographic shifts, particularly a dramatic rise in diabetes prevalence, these classifications are less useful for appropriately classifying patients with diabetes, neuropathy, or an index wound with or without infection, across a broader spectrum of PAD severity. In such patients, limb perfusion is only one determinant of outcome. Wound extent and infection also significantly impact the threat to a limb. The classification can be visualized as three intersecting rings of risk (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F103041\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef103041 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-acute-and-chronic-lower-extremity-ischemia/abstract/15,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,18</a>].&nbsp;WIfI also helps identify which of these risks is &quot;dominant&quot; during a given period of time throughout the patient's life. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wound: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Grade 0 &ndash; Rest pain; no wound, no ulcer, no gangrene.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Grade 1 &ndash; Small shallow ulcer(s) on distal leg or foot, any exposed bone is only limited to distal phalanx; no gangrene (ie, minor tissue loss: limb salvage possible with simple digital amputation [1 or 2 digits], or skin coverage). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Grade 2 &ndash; Deeper ulcer on distal leg or foot with exposed bone, joint, or tendon, or shallow heel ulcer&nbsp;without involvement of the calcaneus; gangrenous changes confined to the digits (ie, major tissue loss: salvageable with &ge;3 digital amputations or standard transmetatarsal amputation [TMA] plus skin coverage).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Grade 3 &ndash; Extensive deep ulcer of the forefoot <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> midfoot, or full-thickness heel ulcer with or without involvement of the calcaneus (ie, extensive tissue loss: salvageable only with complex foot reconstruction or nontraditional TMA [eg, Chopart or Lisfranc amputation]).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ischemia:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Grade 0 &ndash; ABI &ge;0.8, ankle systolic pressure &gt;100 mmHg, toe pressure <span class=\"nowrap\">(TP)/transcutaneous</span> oxygen (TcPO<sub>2</sub>) &ge;60.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Grade 1 &ndash; ABI 0.6 to 0.79, ankle systolic pressure 70 to 100 mmHg, <span class=\"nowrap\">TP/TcPO<sub>2</sub></span> 40 to 59.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Grade 2 &ndash; ABI 0.4 to 0.59, ankle systolic pressure 50 to 70 mmHg, <span class=\"nowrap\">TP/TcPO<sub>2</sub></span> 30 to 39.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Grade 3 &ndash; ABI &le;0.39, ankle systolic pressure &lt;50 mmHg, <span class=\"nowrap\">TP/TcPO<sub>2</sub></span> &lt;30.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Foot infection</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Grade 0 &ndash; No symptoms or signs of infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Grade 1 &ndash; Infection is present and at least two of the following are present: local swelling or induration, erythema &gt;0.5 to &le;2 cm around ulcer, local tenderness or pain, local warmth, or purulent discharge.

The system is not intended to dictate treatment but rather to more precisely stratify patients according to their initial disease burden in a manner that is analogous to Tumor-Nodes-Metastasis (TNM) staging for cancer. WIfI will also allow comparison of therapeutic alternatives among patients with threatened limbs who have a similar risk for amputation. The complete classification is available as an open access document from the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) on the Journal of Vascular Surgery website [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-acute-and-chronic-lower-extremity-ischemia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], and as an Interactive Practice Guideline (iPG) app [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-acute-and-chronic-lower-extremity-ischemia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>The use of WIfI to stratify amputation risk has been reported from multiple centers across the United States and from France, Italy, Germany, Spain, and Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-acute-and-chronic-lower-extremity-ischemia/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. Two publications suggest that WIfI clinical stage 4 patients have a very low wound healing rate (44 percent) and high reintervention rate (46 percent) after endovascular therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-acute-and-chronic-lower-extremity-ischemia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p>In one of these, a prospective cohort study, freedom from major limb amputation was superior for clinical stage 4 patients who underwent bypass compared to those who underwent endovascular therapy. If these results can be confirmed prospectively, WIfI may prove to be a useful tool to aid in the selection of endovascular therapy or open bypass in patients with CLTI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-acute-and-chronic-lower-extremity-ischemia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The WIfI system was also intended to be used for restaging after therapy, much as TNM is used when treating cancer. In other studies, wound, ischemia, and infection grades at one and six months correlated highly with amputation-free survival (AFS) and suggested that serial WIfI staging and restaging identifies a cohort at especially high risk of amputation who may merit timely reintervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-acute-and-chronic-lower-extremity-ischemia/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H909633906\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute extremity ischemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute limb ischemia is defined as a sudden decrease in limb perfusion that causes a potential threat to limb viability in patients who present within two weeks of the acute event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-acute-and-chronic-lower-extremity-ischemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Grading the symptoms of peripheral artery disease and the anatomic lesions responsible for these symptoms provides an objective measure by which to follow patients clinically and, importantly, provides consistency when comparing interventional strategies in clinical studies. (See <a href=\"#H909629103\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Rutherford and Fontaine symptom scales have traditionally been the most widely used classifications for chronic extremity ischemia. An updated threatened limb classification system has been put forth by the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS) to stratify the threat to limb caused by a spectrum of wounds, ischemia, and foot infection (WIfI), in part to reflect the global, epidemic rise in the prevalence of diabetes and diabetic foot ulcers. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A Rutherford scale for acute limb ischemia is a separate and distinct scale from those applied to chronic limb ischemia. (See <a href=\"#H1576665352\" class=\"local\">'Symptom classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arterial lesions are classified anatomically by Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC II) as Type A, B, C, or D based upon the overall success rates of treating the lesion using endovascular or surgical means. Most patients with peripheral artery disease have more than one lesion, at more than one level, so the classification scheme is limited in focusing on singular patterns. TASC II Type A lesions represent simpler, focal lesions of the iliac, femoral, and popliteal arteries, while Type D lesions represent complex, long-segment lesions. Type B and Type C lesions are intermediate lesions. A classification system for the tibial vessels had been proposed but has not been validated. Endovascular therapy is the treatment of choice for Type A lesions and is preferred for Type B lesions. Surgery is the treatment of choice for Type D lesions and is the preferred treatment for good-risk patients with Type C lesions. (See <a href=\"#H909629056\" class=\"local\">'TASC classification'</a> above and <a href=\"#H909629063\" class=\"local\">'Type A lesions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H909629070\" class=\"local\">'Type B lesions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H909629077\" class=\"local\">'Type C lesions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H909629084\" class=\"local\">'Type D lesions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who continue to suffer symptoms related to peripheral artery disease, impairment and disability may need to be quantified for insurance purposes or in order to qualify for disability.
