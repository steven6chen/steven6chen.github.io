Infections are a particular concern during pregnancy since some infections are more severe in pregnant women or may harm the fetus or newborn. However, you can take steps to decrease the chance of developing a potentially harmful illness during pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">AVOIDING EXPOSURE TO INFECTIOUS DISEASES DURING PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following practices can help reduce the chance of exposure to infections known to have the potential to cause problems during pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Hygiene</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnant women can get infections by person-to-person contact, such as kissing, sexual contact, and handling another person&rsquo;s body fluids (eg, saliva or urine) and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth. Good hygiene practices, such as frequent hand washing and avoiding contact with another person's saliva through shared foods, drinks, or utensils, can lessen your chances of becoming infected with potentially harmful illnesses.</p><p>Good hygiene is particularly important for pregnant women who have young children or work with them, as in day care centers or schools. Some potentially harmful infections, such as cytomegalovirus, are more prevalent in young children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Hand washing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hand washing is an essential and very effective way to prevent the spread of infection. Hands should be washed before and after touching raw foods and eating, after going to the bathroom, after changing a diaper or assisting a child with toileting, after wiping a young child&rsquo;s nose or drool, after handling garbage or dirty laundry, after touching animals or pets, after handling children&rsquo;s toys, after contact with another person&rsquo;s saliva, and after gardening or touching <span class=\"nowrap\">dirt/soil</span>.</p><p>Hands should be wet with water and a plain or antimicrobial soap and then rubbed together for 15 to 30 seconds. Pay special attention to the fingernails, between the fingers, and the wrists. Rinse the hands thoroughly and, ideally, dry with a single use towel.</p><p>Alcohol-based hand rubs are a good alternative for disinfecting hands if a sink is not available or if time does not allow for thorough hand washing. Spread hand rubs over the entire surface of hands, fingers, and wrists until dry. Hand rubs are available as a liquid or wipe in small, portable sizes that are easy to carry in a pocket or handbag. When a sink is available, visibly soiled hands should be washed with soap and water.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Food precautions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The US Food and Drug Administration provides free online information on <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/PeopleAtRisk/ucm312704.htm&amp;token=SHauxSdf9qNc6lLK16E8IFdfLuKzRfmQ8BpDv4MxWpkKj92ISAzOdE9ZrcAuj3ntaRAeGcX4QvAxsUbQMiUW3uyTSyFRoJVdpW25JxqwcOODGekWvQdIMEgwA1Ai+E2Q&amp;TOPIC_ID=6717\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Food Safety for Pregnant Women</a>. In particular, products made from unpasteurized milk, raw cookie dough or cake batter, raw or undercooked meat or fish or shellfish, unpasteurized juice or cider, cold deli meats, raw sprouts, and store-made <span class=\"nowrap\">meat/seafood</span> salads can contain bacteria that may be harmful for pregnant women. Raw fruits and vegetables should be washed before consuming.</p><p>Expert groups like the Food Safety and Inspection Services (<a href=\"http://www.fsis.usda.gov/&amp;token=hIOpYdJrKWi3PWBYZCaPX3OXCcLqQ2H+GPVX9kEjZyEKBvq0rPiHjNsjmBM5rFMS&amp;TOPIC_ID=6717\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.fsis.usda.gov</a>) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also have guidelines for food safety for everyone, not just pregnant women. These food precautions are detailed in a separate topic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-poisoning-foodborne-illness-beyond-the-basics#H15\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Food poisoning (foodborne illness) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;, section on 'Food poisoning prevention'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Insect borne illnesses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnant women should take precautions that reduce the risk of acquiring mosquito-borne infections (eg, West Nile virus, Dengue virus, malaria, Zika virus). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=west-nile-virus-infection-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: West Nile virus infection (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Mosquito bites can be prevented by wearing protective clothing and using screens or netting when in areas inhabited by mosquitoes, avoiding the outdoors when mosquitoes are most active (dawn and dusk), and use of DEET-based insect repellents. DEET is the most effective insect repellent currently available. Products with 10 to 35 percent DEET are adequate in most circumstances. Used as recommended, DEET has an excellent safety record. Pregnant and breastfeeding women can use DEET. There have been no studies of picaridin use in pregnant women.</p><p>Updated information regarding mosquito repellents is available from the CDC at <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/RepellentUpdates.htm&amp;token=UbHD2vr1+33r5Ty+UjcQ+1M9w53IhgelJy1byJVzdavLjLgVJujxG+7qht3yLWrzdmedxN5LRaWHOtyJP+tMe9V9/S85peo+0SdwPECRbAQ=&amp;TOPIC_ID=6717\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.cdc.gov/ncidod/dvbid/westnile/RepellentUpdates.htm</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Sexually transmitted infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnant women should be aware that your risk of being infected with a sexually transmitted infection may increase if you have more than one sexual partner or if your partner has more than one sexual partner. If your partner may have other sexual partners, you should ask your partner to wear a condom to reduce the chance of getting a sexually transmitted infection, or you can use a female condom. You should avoid having sex, even with a condom, if your partner has signs of a sexually transmitted infection, such as discharge from the penis, pain when urinating, or blisters or sores on the genital skin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genital-herpes-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Genital herpes (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gonorrhea-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Gonorrhea (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlamydia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Chlamydia (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genital-warts-in-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Genital warts in women (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Users of recreational drugs can acquire infections such as hepatitis and HIV from needle sharing and then transmit these infections through sexual contact.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Travel</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Avoiding travel to high risk locations is one way to minimize the chances of becoming infected with certain infectious diseases, such as malaria, yellow fever, and Zika virus. The possibility of acquiring a food- or water-borne infectious disease is also higher in some parts of the world. For example, unpasteurized cheese is more widely available in France than in the United States. Women who are planning international travel during pregnancy should consult with a travel clinic about infection-related issues for the planned destination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-travel-advice-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: General travel advice (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should be up-to-date on your immunizations before pregnancy. Some immunizations, such as influenza, pertussis, and hepatitis B, can and should be given during pregnancy. Children and other family household members should also be up to date with their immunizations; this decreases a pregnant woman's risk of exposure to infections during pregnancy and both the mother and baby&rsquo;s risks of exposure to infection after birth. Vaccine safety during pregnancy is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccination-during-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Vaccination during pregnancy (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Animal borne illnesses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who are pregnant or planning pregnancy should avoid contact with all rodents (and rodent droppings) and should not change cat litter boxes (or should wear gloves and then wash their hands when changing the litter box). Precautions about handling pets and laboratory animals should be discussed with a healthcare provider. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=animal-and-human-bites-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Animal and human bites (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H464002926\"><span class=\"h2\">Airborne infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some infections are transmitted when a person inhales droplets containing germs that an infected person coughs or sneezes into the air. Minimizing close contact with an ill person and wearing a mask can reduce transmission. Good hand washing also decreases the chance of infecting oneself after touching surfaces with germ-containing droplets.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">INFECTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several infectious diseases can cause problems in pregnancy. Currently, these infections cannot be prevented with a vaccine. These infections are best avoided by practicing good hygiene and avoiding direct contact with infected individuals (although this may be difficult in some cases).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Parvovirus B19 (Fifth disease)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parvovirus B19 infection, also known as &quot;fifth disease,&quot; is a common childhood viral infection. Since the infection is common during childhood, 40 to 60 percent of women are already immune by the time they become pregnant and are therefore not at risk for acquiring parvovirus infection.</p><p>In adults, parvovirus causes mild to severe symptoms, including joint pain, fatigue, and body aches. A rash may appear on the face, trunk, arms, and legs. The rash on the face can be intensely red as though the person had been slapped (this is called a &quot;slapped cheek&quot; appearance). The illness generally resolves without treatment.</p><p>It is difficult to avoid contact with people who are infected with parvovirus because the infection is common in the community and an infected person is contagious before symptoms develop. Frequent hand washing and avoiding shared food, drinks, or utensils can help to prevent infection.</p><p>If you are exposed to parvovirus during pregnancy and you have not been tested previously, a blood test for parvovirus is recommended. A positive test soon after exposure means that you had the infection in the past and are now immune, so the fetus is protected from infection. If blood testing is initially negative, it may be repeated three to four weeks later to confirm that you have not developed the infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parvovirus-b19-infection-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parvovirus B19 infection during pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pregnant women who become infected with parvovirus are monitored closely for signs of complications. Rarely, parvovirus can cause a miscarriage, fetal anemia (low blood count), or fetal heart problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Cytomegalovirus infection (CMV)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a virus that is transmitted by sexual contact or close contact with an infected person's saliva, urine, or other body fluids. Being infected with CMV causes few or no problems in people with a healthy immune system. However, the virus can cause serious problems for infants of mothers who are infected with CMV during pregnancy. The risk of becoming infected with CMV for the first time is higher for pregnant women who live with young children or work in day care centers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytomegalovirus-infection-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cytomegalovirus infection in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Currently, there is no way to prevent CMV infection. Medications to treat CMV in newborns are currently being studied. Vaccines against CMV are also being tested, but are not yet available. Good hygiene practices, especially hand washing, are important to decrease the chances of developing CMV infection during pregnancy. Guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are available at <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/cmv/index.html&amp;token=mjmpv7xMHRIW2nr+3NCnsaVwRe/bvYSP3eD7ZV5zBDe/UfN6MseIo/f7BJA7dT6L&amp;TOPIC_ID=12759\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.cdc.gov/cmv/index.html</a>, and include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after changing diapers, feeding a young child, wiping a young child&rsquo;s nose or drool, and handling children&rsquo;s toys</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Don&rsquo;t share food, drinks, or eating utensils with young children</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Don&rsquo;t put a child&rsquo;s pacifier in your mouth</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Don&rsquo;t share a toothbrush with a young child</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid contact with saliva when kissing a child</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clean toys, countertops, and other surfaces that come into contact with children&rsquo;s urine or saliva</p><p/><p>If you develop a low-grade fever, sore throat, enlarged lymph nodes, and fatigue while pregnant, see your doctor or nurse. You may be tested for CMV with a blood test.</p><p>Most pregnant women with CMV do not need to be treated with antiviral therapy. Maternal antiviral therapy does not prevent fetal disease or reduce the risk of complications in the newborn. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytomegalovirus-infection-in-pregnancy#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cytomegalovirus infection in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Prenatal care and delivery'</a>.)</p><p>There is a low risk of passing CMV infection to a newborn from breastfeeding. However, the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh the minimal risk of passing CMV through breast milk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deciding-to-breastfeed-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Deciding to breastfeed (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Toxoplasmosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic illness that usually causes no symptoms. However, toxoplasmosis can affect the fetus if a woman becomes infected during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxoplasmosis-and-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxoplasmosis and pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pregnant women should avoid eating rare and uncooked meat, which can be a source of this parasite. House cats can also carry toxoplasmosis in their feces. Pregnant women should have someone else change the litter box or wear gloves and then wash their hands carefully afterwards. It is also important to wear gloves while gardening and to wash hands after working in the yard since the soil can be contaminated by cat feces.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Listeria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Listeria is a bacterial infection that can cause fetal death, premature birth, or newborn infection. It can be passed from an infected mother to her fetus through the blood. Signs and symptoms of Listeria include fever, chills, and back pain; a flu-like illness is the most common symptom. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-prognosis-and-prevention-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment, prognosis, and prevention of Listeria monocytogenes infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most people who become infected with Listeria have eaten food that is contaminated. Contaminated foods do not appear rotten or spoiled and it is not possible to know, based upon appearance or smell, if a food is safe. For this reason, women who are pregnant are advised to avoid foods that could contain Listeria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F100500\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100500 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-listeria-monocytogenes-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathogenesis of Listeria monocytogenes infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35866016\"><span class=\"h2\">Chickenpox and rubella</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have had chickenpox (varicella) and rubella, you do not have to worry about getting infected again during pregnancy. If you have not had these infections or vaccines to protect you from these infections, be sure to avoid contact with anyone with these infections, as they can be readily transmitted. These infections can be serious for both the mother and baby. However, if a nonimmune nonimmunized pregnant woman is exposed to an individual with chickenpox, VariZIG, a purified human immune globulin preparation, can be administered as soon as possible within 10 days of exposure and can reduce the risk of developing varicella infection and also decrease the severity of infection in those who become infected. </p><p>Vaccination to protect you from chickenpox or rubella is not safe during pregnancy and should ideally be done prior to getting pregnant or immediately after delivery to protect future pregnancies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=varicella-zoster-virus-infection-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Varicella-zoster virus infection in pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chickenpox-prevention-and-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Chickenpox prevention and treatment (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rubella-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rubella in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35865987\"><span class=\"h2\">Group B streptococcus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many women normally carry group B streptococcus in their vagina <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rectum. Although you will not have symptoms, you can transmit the bacteria to the baby during birth. This can cause a serious newborn infection. For this reason, pregnant women are checked for group B strep a few weeks before expected delivery and, if they carry the bacteria, are given antibiotics during labor to prevent the baby from getting infected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-group-b-streptococcal-disease-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal group B streptococcal disease: Prevention&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=group-b-streptococcus-and-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Group B streptococcus and pregnancy (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35866035\"><span class=\"h2\">Genital herpes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who get genital herpes for the first time near the end of pregnancy or have genital lesions when they go into labor can transmit the infection to the baby during vaginal birth. Herpes infections in newborns can be very serious. If you or your partner has a history of genital herpes, talk to you doctor about the risk of newborn infection and ways to prevent it. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-and-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genital herpes simplex virus infection and pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genital-herpes-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Genital herpes (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35866048\"><span class=\"h2\">Hepatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several types of hepatitis. Hepatitis infection can be acquired in several ways, including sexually, by blood transfusion, by sharing needles, or during birth. If you or your partner has a history of hepatitis, talk to you doctor about the risk of newborn infection and ways to prevent it. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-and-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B and pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vertical-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vertical transmission of hepatitis C virus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35866055\"><span class=\"h2\">HIV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HIV can be passed from a mother to her baby during pregnancy and birth. If you have HIV, appropriate treatment and pregnancy care can reduce this risk to a very low level. For this reason, it is important for all pregnant women to be tested for HIV. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antiretroviral-and-intrapartum-management-of-pregnant-hiv-infected-women-and-their-infants-in-resource-rich-settings\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antiretroviral and intrapartum management of pregnant HIV-infected women and their infants in resource-rich settings&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104242345\"><span class=\"h2\">Zika virus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Zika virus is transmitted predominantly by mosquitoes infected with the virus, but sexual transmission from an infected partner or transmission from transfusion of blood from an infected donor can also occur. Maternal infection during pregnancy, especially early in pregnancy, may lead to fetal infection and pregnancy loss or serious birth defects, such as microcephaly (small head and brain) and impaired vision and hearing. Fetal infection can occur even if the mother has no symptoms of infection (fever, rash, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain, fatigue, headache).</p><p>Pregnant women can reduce their risk of infection by avoiding travel to areas with mosquito transmission of Zika virus, protecting themselves from mosquitos (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Insect borne illnesses'</a> above), and using abstinence or condoms during pregnancy if their sex partner has traveled to or lives in an area with risk of Zika virus infection.<strong> </strong></p><p>You should tell your health care provider promptly if you or your partner may have been exposed to Zika virus because of travel to or residence in an area where the virus is known to occur. Laboratory tests can be done to see if you have been infected and ultrasound examination can be performed to see if your baby appears to be developing normally.

Maternal vaccination also reduces the risk of stillbirth and protects the newborn baby from influenza for several months after birth. The safety of influenza vaccine in pregnancy is well established; no specific concerns for pregnant women, their fetuses, infants, or school-age children have been identified in dozens of research studies and monitoring systems worldwide.
