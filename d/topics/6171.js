Furthermore, the prognosis of pancreatic cancer is poor even in those with potentially resectable disease. The five-year survival following pancreaticoduodenectomy is only about 25 to 30 percent for node-negative and 10 percent for node-positive tumors.

Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States among both men and women. The majority of these tumors (85 percent) are adenocarcinomas arising from the ductal epithelium.

The incidence is greater in males than females (male-to-female ratio 1.3:1) and in blacks than in whites (14.8 per 100,000 in black males compared with 8.8 per 100,000 in the general population) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-nonfamilial-risk-factors-for-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

There are two broad categories of hereditary risk for pancreatic cancer: defined syndromes in which patients are at risk for a pancreatic cancer (and frequently for other malignancies), and familial pancreatic cancer, for which a specific molecular basis has not been identified. These syndromes and the approximate risk for pancreatic cancer are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F107895\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107895 \">table 1</a>).

In the largest analysis of 854 patients undergoing pancreatic cancer resection at a single institution over a 15-year period, 33 were identified as having a potentially deleterious germline mutation, 31 of which affected a known pancreatic cancer susceptibility gene (including <em>BRCA</em>, <em>ATM</em>, <em>PALB2</em>, <em>CDKN2A</em>, and <em>MLH1</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-nonfamilial-risk-factors-for-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. While routine genetic testing of patients with newly diagnosed, apparently sporadic pancreatic cancer may yield some clinical benefits (eg, identifying mutation carriers for whom specific forms of enhanced cancer screening is recommended to reduce the risk of associated cancers, identifying family members of the index case who might benefit from screening for the cancer-predisposing mutation, identifying cancer susceptibility mutations that might be therapeutically targetable), this is not yet considered standard practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-nonfamilial-risk-factors-for-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Blood type is determined by the presence or absence of human blood group antigens, glycoproteins that are expressed on the surface of red blood cells and several other types of cells, including pancreatic cancer cells.</p><p>The relationship between blood type and pancreatic cancer risk was examined in two large independent prospective cohorts (the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-nonfamilial-risk-factors-for-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Compared with blood group O, individuals with non-O blood group (type A, AB, or B) were significantly more likely to develop pancreatic cancer (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] for incident pancreatic cancer 1.32, 1.51. and 1.72, respectively), and the association was nearly identical in the two cohorts. Overall, 17 percent of the 316 pancreatic cancer cases were attributable to inheriting a non-O blood type.</p><p>These findings are supported by the results of a genome-wide association study that identified variants in the ABO locus that were associated with susceptibility to pancreatic cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-nonfamilial-risk-factors-for-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>While these data suggest that ABO blood group status may represent a common inherited susceptibility for pancreatic cancer, additional studies are needed to confirm these findings and establish the potential mechanisms by which ABO blood group influences the risk of pancreatic cancer.

In a report from the International Pancreatitis Study Group, for example, 2015 patients with chronic pancreatitis were followed for a mean of 7.4 years during which a total of 56 pancreatic cancers were identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-nonfamilial-risk-factors-for-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

In a meta-analysis of 88 studies (50 cohort and 30 case-control, predominantly of patients with type 2 diabetes) the pooled relative risk (RR) for pancreatic cancer in diabetics compared with patients without diabetes was 2.08 (95% CI 1.87-2.32) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-nonfamilial-risk-factors-for-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>It has been suggested that diabetes may be a consequence rather than a cause of pancreatic cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-nonfamilial-risk-factors-for-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. As an example, one study compared 512 patients with newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer to 933 controls of similar age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-nonfamilial-risk-factors-for-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

After pancreaticoduodenectomy, diabetes resolved in 17 of 30 patients (57 percent) with new-onset diabetes, while its prevalence was unchanged in the 11 patients who had longstanding diabetes. One intriguing possibility derived from in vitro work is that pancreatic cancers might induce paraneoplastic beta cell dysfunction and inhibition of insulin secretion by shedding exosomes containing adrenomedullin (a vasodilator peptide hormone that regulates insulin balance and may participate in the development of diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-nonfamilial-risk-factors-for-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]) into the systemic circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-nonfamilial-risk-factors-for-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

Compared to controls with a postload plasma glucose of 119 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (6.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> or less, the relative risk of mortality from pancreatic cancer was 1.65, 1.6, and 2.15 for those with levels of 120 to 159 (6.7 to 8.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> 160 to 199 (8.9 to 11.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> and &ge;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (11.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> respectively, even after adjusting for age, race, cigarette smoking, and body mass index (BMI).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An association between pre-diagnosis serum levels of glucose, insulin, insulin resistance, and pancreatic cancer risk was suggested in a case-cohort study within the Alpha-Tocopherol, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-carotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Beta-Carotene</a> Cancer Prevention study, a primary prevention trial enrolling 29,133 male Finnish smokers aged 50 to 69 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-nonfamilial-risk-factors-for-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Fasting serum concentrations of glucose and insulin, and levels of insulin resistance were assessed. The interval between serum collection and follow-up was up to 16.7 years. The study included 169 incident cases of pancreatic cancer that were diagnosed after the fifth year of follow-up and 400 randomly selected controls. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">After adjustment for age, years of smoking, and BMI, higher pre-diagnosis serum concentrations of glucose and insulin, as well as insulin resistance were significantly correlated with the risk of pancreatic cancer. The positive associations were stronger among the cases that occurred more than 10 years after baseline (highest versus lowest quartile for glucose, HR 2.16, 95% CI 1.05-4.42; for insulin, HR 2.90, 95% CI 1.22-6.92; for insulin resistance, HR 2.71, 95% CI 1.19-6.18). The prospective study design, with a minimum five-year follow-up prior to the detection of incident pancreatic cancer, minimizes the possibility that the identified insulin and glucose abnormalities resulted from &quot;subclinical&quot; pancreatic cancer.</p><p/><p>The mechanism underlying this association is unclear. However, at least some data suggest that the increased risk of pancreatic cancer in patients with metabolic diseases such as diabetes mellitus and other states of insulin resistance as well as obesity may be mediated by reduced levels of plasma adiponectin, a fat-derived hormone that has insulin-sensitizing and anti-inflammatory properties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-nonfamilial-risk-factors-for-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>The data linking high glucose levels with an elevated risk of pancreatic cancer have led some to suggest that the new onset of diabetes in a thin older adult should prompt consideration of screening for early diagnosis of a potentially resectable pancreatic cancer. At least three studies have addressed the utility of CT screening for early detection of pancreatic cancer in adults with new-onset diabetes. Two uncovered mainly unresectable tumors, but they selected patients for screening based upon the presence of cancer-related symptoms. A third series from the Mayo Clinic suggested that CT scans done at the time of newly diagnosed diabetes in otherwise asymptomatic patients were more likely to show potentially resectable tumors than scans performed six months later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-nonfamilial-risk-factors-for-exocrine-pancreatic-cancer/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Whether higher resectability rates translated into higher cure rates was not addressed.</p><p>CT screening of all older subjects with new onset diabetes in order to discover a small number of pancreatic cancers is not feasible. Identification of those features that differentiate pancreatic cancer-associated diabetes from other cases with new-onset diabetes would help direct efforts to the subset of individuals who would most benefit from screening CT, but these factors have not yet been established. Thus, screening CT scans are not warranted in older otherwise asymptomatic adults with new-onset atypical diabetes. At present, screening is only carried out for high-risk individuals who have familial syndromes predisposing them to pancreatic cancer.
