The lifetime risk of nephropathy is roughly equivalent in type 1 and type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-diabetic-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of diabetic nephropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The earliest clinical manifestation of renal involvement in diabetes is an increase in albumin excretion (microalbuminuria, or &quot;moderately increased albuminuria&quot; in the new nomenclature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]), a stage at which renal histology may be relatively normal or may reveal glomerulosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. However, regression of moderately increased albuminuria to normoalbuminuria occurs spontaneously in a substantial proportion of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Moderately increased albuminuria (microalbuminuria) in type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moderately-increased-albuminuria-microalbuminuria-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Moderately increased albuminuria (microalbuminuria) in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Proteinuria in diabetes mellitus is occasionally due to a glomerular disease other than diabetic nephropathy. The major clinical clues suggesting nondiabetic glomerular disease are onset of proteinuria less than five years from the documented onset of diabetes in type 1 diabetes, acute onset of renal disease, presence of an active urine sediment containing red cells (particularly acanthocytes) and cellular casts, and in type 1 diabetes, the absence of diabetic retinopathy or neuropathy.

In addition to data from controlled trials, further proof of benefit from these therapies is the observation that the incidence of end-stage renal disease among patients with type 1 diabetes may be decreasing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GLYCEMIC CONTROL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The efficacy of strict glycemic control depends in part upon the stage at which it is begun and the degree of normalization of glucose metabolism; the evidence is best established in type 1 diabetes.

ACE inhibitors were the principal antihypertensive agents in 179 patients.

The average follow-up from the onset of nephrotic-range proteinuria was nearly nine years.

However, although the number of events was low, the incidence of death or the onset of end-stage renal disease was significantly reduced with protein restriction. The mechanism underlying this apparent benefit is unclear.</p><p>There are at least two explanations for the relative lack of benefit of a low-protein diet on GFR in the last study compared to the two previous trials. First, the different in protein intake between the two groups was probably substantially less in the last trial (0.89 versus 1.02 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day). Second, blood pressure, albuminuria, and glycemia were aggressively and similarly controlled in both groups. Given that these factors are independent and significant risk factors for deterioration in GFR, the ability to detect subtle differences in the rate of decline due to protein restriction alone may have been masked.</p><p>There are several potential problems associated with a low-protein diet. In addition to difficulty with compliance due to concurrent fat and simple carbohydrate restriction, diabetics are at increased risk for protein malnutrition because the reduction in intake may be associated with enhanced protein breakdown induced by insulin deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">REDUCTION OF PROTEIN EXCRETION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The degree of proteinuria in glomerular disease tends to vary directly with the intraglomerular pressure. It was therefore proposed that a treatment-induced reduction in protein excretion (in the absence of a large fall in glomerular filtration rate [GFR]) reflected a desirable decline in intraglomerular pressure, and would result in improved renal outcomes.</p><p>There is now consensus that a decrease in protein excretion has predictive importance for improved renal outcomes.

This was illustrated in a randomized trial of 30 overweight patients (body mass index &gt;27 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> with proteinuric nephropathy, 14 of whom had type 2 diabetes; proteinuria significantly decreased at five months among dieters versus the nondieters control group (31 percent decrease versus a slight increase) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/134\" class=\"abstract_t\">134</a>].

A prospective study in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus found that a plasma cholesterol concentration above 220 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (5.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> was an important risk factor for progressive renal disease, particularly if the diastolic pressure were also above 85 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/135\" class=\"abstract_t\">135</a>].

Among 314 participants in the Diabetes Atherosclerosis Intervention Study, all but three patients with type 2 diabetes had either normal albuminuria (214 patients) or moderately increased albuminuria (formerly called microalbuminuria) (97) prior to being randomly assigned to fenofibrate or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>]. In a post-hoc analysis, worsening of proteinuria was significantly less with active therapy. Most prominently, the rate of progression from normal albumin excretion to moderately increased albuminuria at three years was significantly lower with fenofibrate (3 of 101 versus 20 of 113 for placebo).</p><p>Possible mechanisms of benefit with fenofibrate include suppression of inflammation and decreased production of type 1 collagen in mesangial cells.

It now seems clear in type 1 diabetes that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, as part of a therapeutic regimen to achieve blood pressure goals, both lower protein excretion and slow the rate of disease progression in patients with moderately increased albuminuria (the new nomenclature for what was formerly called microalbuminuria) and in those with severely increased albuminuria (the new nomenclature for what was formerly called macroalbuminuria or overt nephropathy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/29,30,32,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30,32,35,36</a>]; a similar effect is seen in type 2 diabetes with ARBs or ACE inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/27,45,47,145-147\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,45,47,145-147</a>]. The blood pressure and proteinuria goals are similar to those in patients with proteinuric nondiabetic chronic kidney disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-nondiabetic-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults#H149378842\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antihypertensive therapy and progression of nondiabetic chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Proteinuria goal'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-nondiabetic-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antihypertensive therapy and progression of nondiabetic chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Blood pressure goal'</a>.)</p><p>It is important to appreciate, however, that these agents slow the rate of progression, but do not stop progression (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F60878\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60878 \">figure 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F80116\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80116 \">figure 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Thus, other modalities are also required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/143\" class=\"abstract_t\">143</a>]. Probably most important is maintenance of strict blood pressure and glycemic control early in the course of the disease. In addition, dietary protein restriction may be beneficial in patients with established nephropathy and aggressive lipid lowering is likely to improve cardiovascular outcomes.

Although these cutoffs defining normal albuminuria, high-normal albuminuria, moderately increased albuminuria, and severely increased albuminuria facilitate determining risk for progression of nephropathy, the risk of developing overt diabetic nephropathy is probably related to higher albumin excretion rates at all levels without arbitrary thresholds. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h2\">Type 1 diabetes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with type 1 diabetes should probably be screened yearly (after the first five years) for the presence of moderately increased albuminuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/150\" class=\"abstract_t\">150</a>].

Measurement of the serum creatinine concentration and estimation of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) should also be performed.

This most likely reflects delayed diagnosis of diabetes, but obesity and atherosclerosis may also account for moderately increased albuminuria. Nevertheless, the presence of moderately increased albuminuria is associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, and most patients with moderately increased albuminuria have other reasons for therapy with an ACE inhibitor or ARB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/153\" class=\"abstract_t\">153</a>].

A review of 12 randomized trials of chronic kidney disease progression found that patients with a limited early acute increase in serum creatinine after initiation of ACE inhibitors were more likely to have long-term preservation of kidney function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-diabetic-nephropathy/abstract/157\" class=\"abstract_t\">157</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperkalemia due to removal of the angiotensin II-mediated stimulus to the release of aldosterone is most likely to occur in patients in whom the plasma potassium concentration is elevated or in the high-normal range prior to therapy.
