They derive their name from homology to the <em>Drosophila</em> Toll molecule, an important component of dorsal-ventral patterning and antifungal defense [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toll-like-receptors-roles-in-disease-and-therapy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. TLRs are part of the innate immune system, which is a phylogenetically ancient system present in invertebrates and conserved through vertebrate evolution. Innate immune responses are initiated rapidly by exposure to microbes and precede the development of adaptive immune responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toll-like-receptors-roles-in-disease-and-therapy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Innate immunity is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of the innate immune system&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunity-of-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunity of the newborn&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3625244456\"><span class=\"h1\">ROLE IN INNATE IMMUNITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TLRs are a type of pattern recognition receptor (PRR), which are receptors specific for molecular components of micro-organisms that are not made by the host. The ligands for TLRs are called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), which are components of pathogenic microbes. In vertebrates, TLRs initiate protective functions that operate independently from adaptive immunity. They also play a critical role in adaptive immune responses by directing the differentiation of na&iuml;ve T cells into effector T cells. Other examples of PRRs include nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) and the retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-the-innate-immune-system#H4044317\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of the innate immune system&quot;, section on 'Pattern recognition receptors'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9261997\"><span class=\"h1\">STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION OF TLRs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different species have different numbers of distinct TLRs. At least 10 have been discovered in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toll-like-receptors-roles-in-disease-and-therapy/abstract/1,2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,4</a>]. With the exception of TLR1, TLR2, and TLR6, TLRs initiate signaling by homodimerization (eg, two identical TLRs brought together). TLR2 forms heterodimers with TLR1 <span class=\"nowrap\">(TLR2/1)</span> or TLR6 <span class=\"nowrap\">(TLR2/6)</span>. Receptor <span class=\"nowrap\">structure/organization,</span> ligands, and signaling are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F61291\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61291 \">table 1</a>) and figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F57602\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57602 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The structure of all of the TLRs is similar. All have an extracellular ligand recognition and binding domain that contains leucine-rich repeats. All have a single transmembrane domain. The cytoplasmic (signaling) domain is homologous to the interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor and is called a <span class=\"nowrap\">toll/IL-1</span> receptor or TIR domain.</p><p>The final common pathway for TLR signaling involves the transcription factors, nuclear factor (NF) for the kappa light chain enhancer in B cells (NF-kappa-B) and activating protein-1 (AP-1). These transcription factors regulate a multitude of genes, including those encoding important proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1-beta, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-12. Some TLRs also activate production of type 1 (alpha and beta) interferons by inducing the interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) IRF3, IRF5, and IRF7.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Cellular and tissue distribution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TLRs are differentially expressed on various leukocyte populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toll-like-receptors-roles-in-disease-and-therapy/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]. Monocytes and macrophages express all TLRs, except TLR3. Myeloid dendritic cells (MDCs) express <span class=\"nowrap\">TLR2/1,</span> TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, and TLR8, while plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs) express TLR7 and TLR9. <span class=\"nowrap\">TLR2/6,</span> TLR4, and TLR8 are found on mast cells. B cells express TLR3, TLR7, TLR9, and TLR10, while T cells express TLR3 and TLR9. A variety of tissue types may express one or more TLRs. As an example, the basolateral surfaces of intestinal epithelial cells express TLR5, whereas fibroblasts and keratinocytes express TLR3 on the cell surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toll-like-receptors-roles-in-disease-and-therapy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The cellular localization of TLRs varies. <span class=\"nowrap\">TLR2/1,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">TLR2/6,</span> TLR4, TLR5, TLR10, and TLR11 are localized to cell surfaces, whereas TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 are localized within endosomes. The cell surface expression of TLRs, such as TLR4, which recognizes lipopolysaccharide (LPS), is hypothesized to allow recognition of extracellular molecules released from pathogens. Endosomal expression of TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 allows recognition of microbial nucleic acids following their uptake and degradation in phagolysosomes. TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 interact with an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein called UNC93B (UNC93 homolog B), which is essential for proper signaling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toll-like-receptors-roles-in-disease-and-therapy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Additionally, endosomal expression of TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 may prevent activation by host nucleic acids and the development of autoimmunity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Signaling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All TLRs, except TLR3, utilize the cytoplasmic proximal signaling intermediate myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88), either by itself (TLR5, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9) or together with the adapter molecule <span class=\"nowrap\">toll/interleukin-1</span> (IL-1) receptor (TIR) domain-containing adapter protein <span class=\"nowrap\">(TIRAP/MyD88</span> adapter-like [MAL], <span class=\"nowrap\">TLR2/1,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">TLR2/6,</span> and TLR4) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F57602\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57602 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toll-like-receptors-roles-in-disease-and-therapy/abstract/1,2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,8</a>]. There is also a MyD88-independent pathway via the molecule TIR domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-beta (IFN-beta) (TRIF), which is used by TLR3 and TLR4 (TLR4 also utilizes the intermediate TRIF-related adapter molecule [TRAM]).</p><p>The MyD88 adapter connects through interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor-associated kinases 1 and 4 (IRAK1, IRAK4), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta-activated protein kinase 1 (TAK1) to the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). This complex kinase cascade culminates in activation of the family of heterodimeric transcription factors known as activating protein-1 (AP-1). These transcription factors regulate a broad array of genes influencing cell survival, activation, and proliferation.</p><p>The TAK1 adapter also leads to activation of the inhibitor of nuclear factor (NF)-kappa-B kinase (IKK) and resultant activation of NF-kappa-B. This is another family of heterodimeric transcription factors regulating many genes with important roles in immune responses, as well as in the physiology of a broad array of other cell types. These include cytokines, chemokines and growth factors, lymphocyte receptors, adhesion molecules, acute-phase reactants, and other transcription factors. Ligation of TLR3 leads to activation of TRAF3 followed by tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and IKK, which in turn activate interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), leading to production of type 1 interferons. TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 signal via a MyD88-dependent pathway that utilizes <span class=\"nowrap\">IRAK1/4,</span> IKK-alpha, <span class=\"nowrap\">TRAF3/6,</span> and intracellular osteopontin (iOPN), which activates IRF7, leading to production of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toll-like-receptors-roles-in-disease-and-therapy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In addition, TLR7-induced production of IFN-alpha has been shown to be dependent upon activation of IRF5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toll-like-receptors-roles-in-disease-and-therapy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Regulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both the cell surface expression of TLRs and the intracellular consequences of TLR ligation are regulated by a variety of factors. These include exposure to microbial products, other TLR ligands, and cytokines. Suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins and ubiquitin-mediated degradation of signaling proteins are involved in negative regulation of TLR signaling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toll-like-receptors-roles-in-disease-and-therapy/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Within the gastrointestinal tract, the factors that maintain tolerance to commensal host flora while <span class=\"nowrap\">detecting/containing</span> pathogenic bacteria with appropriate inflammatory responses are incompletely understood. The detection of common PAMPs in pathogenic and nonpathogenic bacteria would be anticipated to activate the same inflammatory response. Nevertheless, the detection of commensal bacteria within the intestines can induce tolerance. TLR signaling can contribute to intestinal homeostasis by regulating intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and epithelial integrity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toll-like-receptors-roles-in-disease-and-therapy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Expression and localization of TLRs in the intestinal epithelium may directly relate to their role in maintaining homeostasis versus inducing inflammation. For example, within the intestinal epithelium, TLR9 activation through the apical membrane induces tolerance, whereas TLR9 activation via the basolateral membrane induces an inflammatory response through the canonical nuclear factor (NF)-kappa-B pathway. Differential spatial expression of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in epithelia may constitute a critical mechanism of distinguishing nonpathologic from pathologic bacteria. Regulation of TLR function is highly complex and still incompletely understood and beyond the scope of this review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toll-like-receptors-roles-in-disease-and-therapy/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIFIC TLRs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ligands, cellular expression, signaling molecules utilized, and resultant cellular effects of ligation for each of the TLRs are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F61291\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61291 \">table 1</a>).

TLR3 is found within endolysosomes (membrane-bound intracellular compartments formed by the fusion of vesicles of internalized viral debris and lysosomes containing degradative enzymes) of MDCs, B cells, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toll-like-receptors-roles-in-disease-and-therapy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. TLR3 signals via a MyD88-independent pathway (TIR domain-containing adaptor-inducing interferon [TRIF]) and induces production of type 1 interferon-beta (IFN-beta) in addition to inflammatory cytokines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>TLR4</strong> &ndash; The principal ligand for TLR4 is the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Gram-negative bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toll-like-receptors-roles-in-disease-and-therapy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The interaction of LPS with TLR4 occurs in a complex with LPS-binding protein (LBP), CD14, and a molecule called myeloid differentiation factor-2 (MD-2) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F57602\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57602 \">figure 1</a>). Additional ligands include the fusion protein of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), heat shock proteins of organisms, such as <em>Chlamydia pneumoniae</em>, and components of the extracellular matrix, such as fibronectin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyaluronate-derivatives-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hyaluronic acid</a>, and heparan sulfate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toll-like-receptors-roles-in-disease-and-therapy/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>].

Both bind to single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) from viruses, such as influenza and human immunodeficiency virus-I (HIV-I). They also recognize imidazoquinolines (synthetic heterocyclic organic molecules), such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiquimod-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imiquimod</a>, and guanosine analogs, such as loxoribine. TLR7 is expressed on MDCs, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs), and B lymphocytes. TLR8 is expressed on MDCs and mast cells. Both signal directly via MyD88.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>TLR9</strong> &ndash; TLR9 interacts with unmethylated cytosine guanine dinucleotide (CpG) motifs in microbial DNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toll-like-receptors-roles-in-disease-and-therapy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. TLR9 is expressed within endolysosomes of PDCs, B cells, and T cells and signals directly via MyD88. Activation of PDCs (also known as IFN-producing cells) through TLR7 and TLR9 leads to production of large quantities of IFN-alpha, which plays a critical role in antiviral innate immunity. Additionally, PDCs, by virtue of their production of IFN-alpha and IL-12, are potent inducers of differentiation of na&iuml;ve T cells into T helper type 1 (Th1) effector T cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>TLR10</strong> &ndash; TLR10 is a modulatory PRR with largely inhibitory functions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toll-like-receptors-roles-in-disease-and-therapy/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. TLR10 is believed to exert inhibitory functions through competition with ligand binding to TLRs. Furthermore, TLR10 may compete for heterodimer formation with TLR2.

Defects that occur proximally in the TLR pathway, such as deficiency in myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88) or interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) lead to susceptibility to a limited number of pathogens (typically pyogenic bacteria), since these defects only impair the function of TLRs.</p><p>In contrast, distal defects involving transcription factors (ie, nuclear factor [NF]-kappa-B complex) lead to broader infectious susceptibilities (eg, bacteria, viruses, fungi, and opportunistic organisms), as well as developmental abnormalities (ie, ectodermal dysplasia). This is because of the diverse immune and developmental mechanisms that signal through NF-kappa-B, including pathways in innate immunity (ie, TLRs), adaptive immunity (ie, T cell receptor, B cell receptor, and CD40), and ectodermal development (ie, ectodysplasin A receptor).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5549320\"><span class=\"h3\">MyD88/IRAK4 deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All TLRs, except TLR3, use the cytoplasmic proximal signaling intermediate myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88), either by itself or together with the adapter molecule <span class=\"nowrap\">toll/IL-1</span> receptor domain-containing adapter protein (TIRAP). MyD88 deficiency was initially described in nine children suffering from recurrent and severe pyogenic bacterial infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toll-like-receptors-roles-in-disease-and-therapy/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. These children were susceptible to invasive infections with <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, and <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, but had normal resistance to other common bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. Three children died before the age of 1 year, while another six were alive at ages 3 to 16 years at the time of publication. Susceptibility to infection improved with age in affected patients, although MyD88 levels did not change, suggesting that maturation of the adaptive immune system may compensate for defective TLR function. The defect displayed autosomal recessive inheritance. MyD88 deficiency is clinically indistinguishable from IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) deficiency, since IRAK4 associates with MyD88 in signal transduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toll-like-receptors-roles-in-disease-and-therapy/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Deficiency of IRAK4 (MIM 607676) impairs signaling from the TLRs that associate only with the MyD88 adapter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F112557\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112557 \">figure 3</a>).

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with IRAK4 deficiency or MyD88 deficiency do not produce proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1, and IL-6 when stimulated via IL-1 or IL-18 receptors or TLRs. The lack of responsiveness to IL-1 results in impaired fever responses to bacterial infection. The lack of significant fever and the unexpectedly low level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the setting of a serious bacterial infection can be a clue to the possibility of IRAK4 deficiency or MyD88 deficiency.</p><p>The clinical and laboratory features of IRAK4 deficiency are indistinguishable from MyD88 deficiency, since IRAK4 associates with MyD88 in signal transduction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F112557\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112557 \">figure 3</a>).

None had severe viral, fungal, or parasitic infections. Initial invasive infections occurred before the age of two years in 88 percent. Invasive pneumococcal infections caused the most morbidity and mortality and were the cause of death in 33 percent. In patients with either IRAK4 deficiency or MyD88 defects, susceptibility to infections seems to improve with age, regardless of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toll-like-receptors-roles-in-disease-and-therapy/abstract/46,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,51</a>].

NEMO is required for the proper function of IKK, which inactivates the inhibitor of NF-kappa-B (I-kappa-B) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F112557\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112557 \">figure 3</a>). In the absence of IKK activity, I-kappa-B remains bound to NF-kappa-B, holding it in the cytoplasm in an inactive form and preventing its translocation to the nucleus to exert its transcriptional regulatory activities. Thus, in the absence of NEMO function, NF-kappa-B signaling is blocked, shutting down many pathways, including innate immune functions (ie TLRs, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain [NOD]-like receptors [NLRs], retinoic acid-inducible gene-I [RIG-I]-like receptors [RLRs]), adaptive immune functions (T cell receptor, B cell receptor, CD40), and developmental pathways (ie, ectodysplasin A receptor in ectoderm and receptor activator of NF-kappa-B [RANK] in osteoclasts) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F112546\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112546 \">figure 2</a>). Complete absence of NEMO function is lethal in male embryos, and partial deficiency in females leads to a condition called incontinentia pigmenti [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toll-like-receptors-roles-in-disease-and-therapy/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

Because NF-kappa-B also transduces signals from receptor systems important for the development of skin and skin appendages, the majority of patients with hypomorphic mutations also have ectodermal dysplasia, a disorder known as ectodermal dysplasia with immunodeficiency (ED-ID) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F112546\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112546 \">figure 2</a>).

The ligands for these receptors are components of pathogenic microbes called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). TLRs are part of the innate immune system, although they also modulate mechanisms that impact the development of adaptive immune responses. (See <a href=\"#H3625244456\" class=\"local\">'Role in innate immunity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TLRs are expressed on leukocytes and various solid tissue cells. The cellular localization of TLRs varies. <span class=\"nowrap\">TLR2/1,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">TLR2/6,</span> TLR4, TLR5, TLR10, and TLR11 are localized to cell surfaces, whereas TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 are localized within endosomes. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Cellular and tissue distribution'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The structure of all of the TLRs is similar. Receptor structure, organization, ligands, and signaling are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F61291\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61291 \">table 1</a>) and figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F57602\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57602 \">figure 1</a>). The final common pathway for TLR signaling involves transcription factors that regulate a multitude of genes, including those encoding important proinflammatory cytokines and type 1 interferons. (See <a href=\"#H9261997\" class=\"local\">'Structure and function of TLRs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Defects in proximal signaling molecules within TLR signaling pathways, including myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MyD88) and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4), have been implicated in primary immunodeficiency to a narrow spectrum of microbes, resulting in susceptibility to pyogenic bacterial infections. UNC93B1 (UNC93 homolog B1), TLR3, <span class=\"nowrap\">toll/interleukin-1</span> (IL-1) receptor (TIR) domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-beta (IFN-beta) (TRIF), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 3 (TRAF3), and tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) mutations have been identified in patients with selective susceptibility to herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) encephalitis. In contrast, defects in more distal components of TLR signaling pathways (ie, nuclear factor [NF]-kappa-B essential modulator [NEMO], I-kappa-B-alpha, heme-oxidized IRP2 ubiquitin ligase-1 [HOIL-1], and HOIL-1 interacting protein [<em>HOIP</em>]) are associated with broader infectious susceptibilities (bacteria, mycobacteria, viruses, fungi, opportunistic organisms). Dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) deficiency impairs multiple cellular functions in a variety of cells types, leading to a combined immunodeficiency. (See <a href=\"#H3385581618\" class=\"local\">'TLR signaling defects in primary immunodeficiency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TLR-based therapies in development or in use include the TLR7 agonists <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiquimod-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imiquimod</a> and isatoribine. In addition, oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) containing cytosine guanine dinucleotide (CpG) motifs, presumably through binding to TLR9, have been found to augment T helper type 1 (Th1) immune responses and have been applied to vaccination, cancer therapy, and immunotherapy for allergic disease.
