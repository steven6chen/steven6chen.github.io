(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acid-reflux-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-infants-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux) in infants (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">WHY DOES VOMITING OCCUR?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vomiting occurs when nerves in the body or brain sense a trigger, such as food poisoning, certain infections or medicines, or motion. Nausea usually, but not always, occurs before vomiting. Younger children may not be able to recognize nausea, although they may complain of a stomach ache or have other general complaints.</p><p>Vomiting often has a benefit since it provides a way for the body to get rid of potentially harmful substances. However, medicines and methods to induce vomiting (eg, syrup of ipecac, placing a finger in the throat) are no longer recommended, even if an infant or child has ingested a harmful substance. In this case, it is best to immediately call for emergency medical assistance, available in the United States by calling 911.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Vomit versus spit up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a difference between vomiting and spitting up, although the terms are often used interchangeably. Vomiting usually has more force behind it and is larger in amount. Spitting up often occurs with a burp after feeding. The medical term for this is gastroesophageal reflux (GER). Most infants spit up milk or formula through the mouth or nose. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acid-reflux-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-infants-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux) in infants (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES OF VOMITING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vomiting can be caused by a number of different problems. The possible causes of vomiting depend upon a child's age.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Newborns and young infants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It can be hard to tell if an infant is spitting up or vomiting because some infants reflux forcefully or in large amounts. Your child's doctor or nurse can help to determine the cause and if treatment is needed.</p><p>In newborns and young infants (up to three months old), forceful vomiting can indicate a serious condition and always requires further evaluation. Potential causes of vomiting in these infants include a blockage or narrowing of the stomach (pyloric stenosis) or a blockage of the intestines (intestinal obstruction).</p><p>Infants can also vomit because of infections of the intestine or other parts of the body. Any young infant (newborn to three months) who develops a temperature of 100.4&ordm; F (38&ordm; C) or higher, with or without vomiting, should see a doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Older infants and children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common cause of vomiting in older infants and children is infectious gastroenteritis (an infection of the stomach or intestines), usually caused by a virus. Vomiting caused by gastroenteritis usually begins suddenly and resolves quickly, often within 24 to 48 hours. Other signs of gastroenteritis can include nausea, diarrhea, fever, or abdominal pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-diarrhea-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Acute diarrhea in children (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Gastroenteritis can develop after eating contaminated food or putting a contaminated object (or hand) into the mouth. The viruses that commonly cause gastroenteritis are spread easily. Careful hygiene (especially hand washing) can prevent these infections from spreading.</p><p>Less commonly, vomiting occurs after consuming improperly stored or prepared foods that contain bacteria or toxins; this is called food poisoning. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-poisoning-foodborne-illness-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Food poisoning (foodborne illness) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other illnesses can also cause vomiting in older infants and children, including gastroesophageal reflux, peptic ulcer disease, an intestinal blockage (obstruction), cyclic vomiting syndrome, respiratory and urinary tract infections, and others. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acid-reflux-gastroesophageal-reflux-in-infants-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux) in infants (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acid-reflux-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-children-and-adolescents-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux disease) in children and adolescents (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Adolescents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Similar to children, the most common cause of nausea and vomiting in adolescents is infectious gastroenteritis. Vomiting usually resolves within 24 to 48 hours in an adolescent with gastroenteritis.</p><p>Less common causes of vomiting in adolescents include appendicitis (inflammation of the appendix), induced vomiting (eg, as seen with bulimia), pregnancy, gastric ulcers (of the stomach), pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), inflammatory bowel disease (eg, Crohn's disease), and consumption of toxic substances (eg, overdose).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">NAUSEA AND VOMITING DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most children with vomiting do not need to be seen by a health care provider. However, you should monitor for signs that the child is getting worse or not getting better within 24 hours. If your child has severe or persistent pain or has signs of dehydration, she or he should be seen sooner. If you are concerned about your child, call the child's doctor or nurse. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'When to seek help'</a> below.)</p><p>If the child sees a doctor or nurse, he or she will review the child's medical history, perform an exam, and if needed, perform testing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">HOME CARE OF NAUSEA AND VOMITING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following are some simple recommendations to help care for children with nausea and vomiting at home.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitor for dehydration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dehydration can develop in children with vomiting.</p><p>Signs of mild dehydration include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A slightly dry mouth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thirst</p><p/><p>Children who are mildly dehydrated do not need immediate medical attention but should be monitored for signs of worsening dehydration.</p><p>Signs of moderate or severe dehydration include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased urination (not going to the bathroom or no wet diaper in six hours)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lack of tears when crying</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A dry mouth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sunken eyes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cool or clammy hands and feet</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Listlessness</p><p/><p>A child who is moderately or severely dehydrated should be evaluated by a doctor or nurse as soon as possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Dietary recommendations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children who are vomiting but are not dehydrated can continue to eat a regular diet as tolerated. Dehydrated children require rehydration (replacement of lost fluid). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Oral rehydration therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Infants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a breastfeeding infant vomits, he or she should continue to breastfeed unless your doctor or nurse tells you otherwise. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-rehydration-solutions-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Oral rehydration solutions</a> (eg, Pedialyte) are not usually needed for infants who exclusively breastfeed because breastmilk is more easily digested. </p><p>If your infant vomits immediately after nursing, you can try to breastfeed more frequently and for a shorter time. For example, breastfeed every 30 minutes for five to 10 minutes. If vomiting improves after two to three hours, resume the usual feeding schedule. If vomiting worsens or does not improve within 24 hours, call your child's doctor or nurse. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'When to seek help'</a> below.)</p><p>If your infant drinks formula, initially offer one-half to one ounce of an oral rehydration solution (eg, Pedialyte) every 15 minutes for two to three hours. If vomiting occurs after drinking, wait 30 minutes and try again. If vomiting improves, resume feeding with full strength infant formula. If vomiting worsens or does not improve within 24 hours, call your child's doctor or nurse. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'When to seek help'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Older infants and children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Older infants and children who vomit can continue to eat, if desired. However, it is common for children to have little or no appetite during a vomiting illness.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitor for signs of dehydration, and do not force the child to eat, especially during the first 24 hours. Encourage the child to drink fluids. The best fluids are the commercially prepared <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-rehydration-solutions-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oral rehydration solutions</a> (eg, Pedialyte) (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Oral rehydration therapy'</a> below). Other fluids, including water, diluted juice, or soda can be given in small quantities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apple, pear, and cherry juice, and other beverages with high sugar content, should be avoided. Sports drinks (eg, Gatorade) should also be avoided since they have too much sugar and have inappropriate electrolyte levels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recommended foods include a combination of complex carbohydrates (rice, wheat, potatoes, bread), lean meats, yogurt, fruits, and vegetables. High fat foods are more difficult to digest, and should be avoided.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is not necessary to restrict a child's diet to clear liquids or the BRAT diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, toast). Although these and similar foods might be recommended to decrease diarrhea, these foods do not contain enough nutrients for a child.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral rehydration therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) was developed as a safer, less-expensive, and easier alternative to intravenous (IV) fluids. Oral rehydration solution (ORS) is a liquid solution that contains glucose (a sugar) and electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride), which are lost during vomiting and diarrhea.</p><p>ORS does not cure vomiting, but it does help to prevent and treat the dehydration that can develop because of a vomiting illness. You can buy ORS at most grocery stores and pharmacies in the United States without a prescription. A few widely available brands include Pedialyte, Infalyte, and ReVital, although generic brands work equally well (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F70752\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70752 \">table 1</a>). Gelatin, tea, fruit juice, rice water, and other beverages are not recommended in children who are dehydrated. Do not try to prepare ORS recipes at home because the formulas must be exact.</p><p>You can give ORS at home if your child is mildly dehydrated, refusing to eat a normal diet, or has vomiting, diarrhea, or both. If needed, you can give ORS in frequent, small sips or small amounts by spoon, bottle, or cup over three to four hours. Your child's doctor or nurse might provide specific instructions for giving oral rehydration. One method is described below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The recommended amount is 5 teaspoons of ORS for every pound of body weight (or 50 milliliters per kilogram) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F62163\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62163 \">table 2</a>). For a 20-pound (9 kg) child, this would equal 100 teaspoons (450 milliliters) of ORS. This amount should be given gradually, spread out over about four hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measure the solution with a standardized medicine syringe or measuring cup or spoon, rather than a regular cup or spoon.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give the fluid by teaspoonfuls (5 milliliters each) every one to two minutes or as tolerated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After you give the whole amount, the child can eat a normal diet.</p><p/><p>Children who refuse to drink or who vomit immediately after drinking ORS should be monitored closely for worsening dehydration. Children who are not dehydrated can continue to drink ORS between episodes of vomiting to prevent dehydration. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Monitor for dehydration'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Medicines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medicines to reduce nausea and vomiting, called antiemetics, might be recommended in certain situations (to reduce the risk of dehydration in children who vomit repeatedly or to reduce motion sickness). These medicines require a prescription, and you should not give them to an infant or child unless your child's doctor or nurse has recommended them. Non-prescription treatments for nausea or vomiting are not recommended for infants or children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Preventing spread</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your child is vomiting, you need to be careful to avoid spreading the infection to yourself, your family, and friends. Wash your hands frequently and keep sick children out of school or daycare. Children with vomiting (two or more times in 24 hours) that is caused by a contagious condition should be kept out of school or daycare until they have not vomited for 24 hours.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Hygiene measures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hand washing is very effective and the preferred way to prevent the spread of infection. Wet your hands with water and plain or antimicrobial soap, and rub them together for 15 to 30 seconds. Pay special attention to the fingernails, between the fingers, and the wrists. Rinse your hand thoroughly, dry them with a paper towel, and throw away the paper towel.</p><p>Alcohol-based hand rubs are an acceptable alternative for disinfecting hands if a sink is not available. Spread the hand rub over the entire surface of your hands, fingers, and wrists until dry. You can use the rub over and over, if needed. Hand rubs are available as a liquid or wipe in small, portable sizes that are easy to carry in a pocket or handbag. If your hands are visibly dirty, you should wash them with soap and water.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">WHEN TO SEEK HELP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should call your doctor or nurse <strong>immediately</strong> if your child has any of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bile (green) or blood-tinged (red or brown) vomit.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any episode of forceful vomiting in a newborn, or vomiting that continues for more than 24 hours in an infant or child.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If an infant refuses to eat or drink anything for more than a few hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderate to severe dehydration: dry mouth, no tears when crying, not urinating or having a wet diaper in four to six hours (for babies and young children) or not urinating in six to eight hours (for older children).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal pain that is severe, even if it comes and goes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bloody bowel movements.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever higher than 102&ordm;F (39&ordm;C) once or fever higher than 101&ordm;F (38.4&ordm;C) for more than three days.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Behavior changes, including lethargy or decreased responsiveness.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your child's health care provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your child's medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our web site (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=1223\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
