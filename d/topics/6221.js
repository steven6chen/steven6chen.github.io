However, the abbreviation of &quot;PCP&quot; is still used to refer to the clinical entity of &quot;<strong><em>P</em></strong><em>neumo</em><strong><em>c</em></strong><em>ystis</em> <strong>p</strong>neumonia&quot;; this allows for the retention of the familiar acronym amongst clinicians and maintains the accuracy of this abbreviation in older published papers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> was first appreciated as a cause of pneumonia among premature and malnourished infants in Europe following World War II [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pneumocystis-pneumonia-in-hiv-uninfected-patients/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].

A single <em>Pneumocystis </em>strain was found to cause the outbreaks in Germany and Switzerland, and the strain was different from the strain that caused the outbreak in Japan and the strains that caused sporadic cases of non-transplant-associated PCP.

However, as the clinical awareness of PCP in HIV-uninfected patients has increased and the laboratory diagnosis of PCP has improved, it is now common to see PCP presenting in HIV-uninfected patients with mild to moderate disease with more indolent and less severe dyspnea and cough. However, some patients still present with more severe infection with accompanying respiratory compromise. Nearly all patients with PCP will have either hypoxemia at rest or with exertion or an increase in the alveolar-arterial oxygen tension gradient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1792944961\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is often used as a clinical indicator of possible PCP in HIV-infected individuals. However, in immunocompromised patients without HIV infection, LDH has little utility as it can be elevated from underlying hematologic malignancy. It can also be elevated from causes of acute lung injury other than PCP. Nonetheless, an elevated LDH in the setting of pulmonary infiltrates without another apparent cause should raise suspicion for PCP.</p><p>Beta-D-glucan is a cell wall component of most fungi, including <em>Pneumocystis</em>. Although the serum beta-D-glucan assay can be elevated in the setting of a number of other fungal infections, when it is elevated, it also raises suspicion for PCP. When the beta-D-glucan assay is elevated in a patient with risk factors and clinical findings suggestive of PCP, a specific microbiologic or molecular diagnosis should be pursued.

Increasingly, elevated serum levels of beta-D-glucan are used to help support this diagnosis.</p><p>Some clinicians may choose to forego obtaining a definitive diagnosis if beta-D-glucan levels are markedly elevated and the clinical presentation and radiographic findings are highly consistent with PCP. However, such testing can yield positive results in patients with a number of other fungal infections and some bacterial infections (eg, <em>Pseudomonas</em>) or exposure to materials contaminated with reactive components (eg, gauze packing, intravenous immunoglobulin).

Staining is necessary because <em>Pneumocystis</em> cannot be cultured. Direct fluorescent antibody staining using a fluorescein-conjugated monoclonal antibody can visualize both trophic forms and cysts and is the most common technique used. Trophic forms can also be seen with tinctorial stains such as Gram-Weigert, Wright-Giemsa, or modified Papanicolaou stains.
