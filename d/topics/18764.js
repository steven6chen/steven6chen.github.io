These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Burning or stinging</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A &quot;raw&quot; feeling, like the vulva was rubbed by something rough</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Redness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal discharge</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4190561\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes vulvar itching?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vulvar itching has many different causes. Some common causes include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allergies</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin irritation from soap, lotion, or another product that was on the vulva</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infections in the vagina or vulva</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A skin disease called &quot;lichen sclerosus&quot; &ndash; This disease causes itching and skin changes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pubic lice, also called &quot;crabs&quot; &ndash; These are tiny insects that can live in the hair around the vulva.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4190576\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you have vulvar itching, see a doctor or nurse so that he or she can figure out the cause. Your doctor or nurse will talk with you and do an exam.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4190591\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. The doctor or nurse might be able to find the cause of the itching by talking with you and doing an exam. If this happens, you might not need any tests.</p><p>If you do need tests, they can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests on a sample of fluid from the vagina &ndash; These tests can check for infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A &quot;patch test&quot; &ndash; In this test, a doctor puts small amounts of different substances on the skin of your back. Then, he or she checks to see if the substances cause itching.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A &quot;biopsy&quot; &ndash; In this test, a doctor takes a small sample of skin from the vulva. Another doctor looks at the sample under a microscope. You might have this test if other tests do not show the cause of your vulvar itching. But most women with vulvar itching do not need this test.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4190606\"><span class=\"h1\">How is vulvar itching treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the itching is caused by another medical condition, such as an infection, treating the condition usually gets rid of it. Or the doctor might tell you to stop using substances or products that can cause itching.</p><p>Treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to treat infection &ndash; These can be pills you take by mouth, gels or creams you put in the vagina, or shots.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to relieve itching &ndash; These can be ointments you put on the vulva or pills you take by mouth. If your itching is very bad at night, the doctor might give you <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxepin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">doxepin</a> (brand name: Silenor) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyzine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">hydroxyzine</a> (brand name: Vistaril). These medicines can relieve itching and help you sleep. If other treatments to relieve itching do not work, the doctor might give you a shot of medicine in the itchy area. He or she will put a numbing cream or gel on the vulva before giving the shot.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to get rid of pubic lice &ndash; These are lotions or creams you put on the skin. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Sitz baths&quot; &ndash; Your doctor might tell you to soak the vulva in 2 or 3 inches of warm water. This is called a &quot;sitz bath.&quot; You can do this for 5 minutes in the morning and 5 minutes at night. Do not add soap, bubble bath, or anything else to the water. </p><p/><p>If your vulvar itching is caused by an infection, your sex partner might need to see a doctor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4190621\"><span class=\"h1\">Can vulvar itching be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can prevent vulvar itching from some causes by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using warm water and unscented non-soap cleanser to wash your vulva</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taking baths in plain warm water, and not using scented bath products</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not using a hair dryer or rubbing the vulva dry &ndash; Instead, dry it by patting with a soft towel.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wearing cotton underwear, and not wearing underwear or pants that are too tight</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not using sprays or powders on your vulva</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not douching (douching is when a woman puts a liquid inside her vagina to rinse it out)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not wiping with baby wipes or scented toilet paper after you use the toilet</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4190636\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lichen-sclerosus-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Lichen sclerosus (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=trichomoniasis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Trichomoniasis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-discharge-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaginal discharge in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvovaginal-yeast-infection-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vulvovaginal yeast infection (The Basics)</a> </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lichen-sclerosus-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Lichen sclerosus (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pubic-lice-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Pubic lice (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-discharge-in-adult-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vaginal discharge in adult women (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-yeast-infection-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vaginal yeast infection (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
