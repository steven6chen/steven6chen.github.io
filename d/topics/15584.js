It happens when certain ligaments in the shoulder joint tear or get stretched too much. Ligaments are strong bands of tissue that connect bones to other bones. The shoulder joint is made up of 3 bones: the collar bone, the shoulder blade, and the upper arm bone.</p><p>The most common causes of a separated shoulder are falling on the shoulder or getting hit in the shoulder.</p><p>A separated shoulder can be mild or severe, depending on how many ligaments are torn.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32441585\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a separated shoulder?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms can be mild or severe and usually include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shoulder pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling in the shoulder</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32441592\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You might. Your doctor or nurse will talk with you and do an exam. He or she will also probably do X-rays of your shoulder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32441599\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a separated shoulder treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most separated shoulders heal on their own, but they can take weeks to months to heal completely. To help your shoulder heal, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rest the shoulder &ndash; Avoid lifting things, reaching overhead or across your chest, or sleeping on that shoulder.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use an arm sling to protect your shoulder and keep it still</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ice your shoulder &ndash; Put a cold gel pack, bag of ice, or bag of frozen vegetables on the injured area every 1 to 2 hours, for 15 minutes each time. Put a thin towel between the ice (or other cold object) and your skin. Use the ice (or other cold object) for at least 6 hours after your injury. Some people find it helpful to ice longer, even up to 2 days after their injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take a pain-relieving medicine &ndash; Ask your doctor or nurse about taking an over-the-counter medicine for your pain, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand names: Aleve, Naprosyn).</p><p/><p>If you have a severe separated shoulder, you might need surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32441606\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Different exercises can help your shoulder get better.</p><p>To keep your shoulder from getting too stiff, you can do an exercise called the pendulum stretch. To do this exercise, let your arm relax and hang down while you sit or stand. Move your arm back and forth, then side to side, and then around in small circles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F50148\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50148 \">figure 1</a>). Try to do this exercise for 5 minutes, 1 or 2 times a day.</p><p>Other exercises can help strengthen the muscles around your shoulder. Your doctor, nurse, or physical therapist (exercise expert) can show you how to do these types of exercises. He or she will tell you when to start them and how often to do them.</p><p>When you do shoulder exercises, it's important to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Warm up your shoulder first by taking a hot shower or bath, or putting a heating pad on it.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Start slowly and make the exercises harder over time. For example, when you do the pendulum stretch, keep the circles you make with your arm small at first. Over time, make this exercise harder by making bigger circles or holding weights in your hand.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Know that some soreness is normal. If you have sharp or tearing pain, stop what you're doing and let your doctor or nurse know.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32441613\"><span class=\"h1\">When will I be able to do my usual activities again?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It depends on how severe your separated shoulder is. If your injury is mild, you might be able to return to your usual activities after a few days. If your injury is more serious, it might take weeks to months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32441620\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=frozen-shoulder-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Frozen shoulder (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acromioclavicular-joint-injury-shoulder-separation-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Acromioclavicular joint injury (shoulder separation) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=frozen-shoulder-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Frozen shoulder (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
