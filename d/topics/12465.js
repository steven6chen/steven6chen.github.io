Following an inspiratory trigger, a predetermined mixture of air (ie, oxygen and other gases) is forced into the central airways and then flows into the alveoli. As the lungs inflate, the intraalveolar pressure increases. A termination signal eventually causes the ventilator to stop forcing air into the central airways and the central airway pressure decreases. Expiration follows passively, with air flowing from the higher pressure alveoli to the lower pressure central airways.</p><p>The types of mechanical ventilation, as well as its benefits, indications, and initiation are discussed in this topic review. Potential complications are described separately.

It is indicated for acute or chronic respiratory failure, which is defined as insufficient oxygenation, insufficient alveolar ventilation, or both. Some common acute disorders for which mechanical ventilation may be required are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F67457\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67457 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Mechanical ventilation should be considered early in the course of illness and should not be delayed until the need becomes emergent. Physiologic derangements and clinical findings can be helpful in assessing the severity of illness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F66496\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66496 \">table 2</a>). However, the decision to initiate mechanical ventilation should be based upon clinical judgment that considers the entire clinical situation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Some of the objectives of mechanical ventilation are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F78508\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78508 \">table 3</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">BENEFITS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principal benefits of mechanical ventilation during respiratory failure are improved gas exchange and decreased work of breathing:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mechanical ventilation improves gas exchange by improving ventilation-perfusion <span class=\"nowrap\">(V/Q)</span> matching. This is primarily a consequence of decreased physiologic shunting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiologic-and-pathophysiologic-consequences-of-mechanical-ventilation#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiologic and pathophysiologic consequences of mechanical ventilation&quot;, section on 'Reduced shunt'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The work of breathing can increase due to altered lung mechanics (eg, increased airways resistance, decreased compliance) or increased respiratory demand (eg, metabolic acidemia). The effort required to maintain this elevated work of breathing may result in respiratory muscle fatigue and respiratory failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/1,3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,4</a>]. Mechanical ventilation can assume some or all of the increased work of breathing, allowing the ventilatory muscles to recover from their fatigue.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF BREATHS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mechanical ventilation can deliver different types of breaths, including volume control, volume assist, pressure control, pressure assist, and pressure support. They are defined by the combination of three features:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trigger &ndash; Breaths can be triggered by a timer (ventilator-initiated breaths) or patient effort (patient-initiated breaths). Breaths that are initiated by a timer occur at the set respiratory rate, while those that are initiated by patient effort occur when the patient causes sufficient change in either the pressure or flow in the circuit. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Trigger'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Target &ndash; The flow of air into the lung can target a predetermined flow rate (ie, the peak inspiratory flow rate) or pressure limit.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Termination &ndash; The signal for a ventilator to end inspiration may be volume-, time-, or flow-related. Examples include delivery of the set tidal volume, completion of the predetermined duration of inspiration, or a decrease in the inspiratory flow to a predetermined percentage of its peak value, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Volume control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Volume control (VC) breaths are ventilator-initiated breaths with a set inspiratory flow rate. Inspiration is terminated once the set tidal volume has been delivered. Airway pressure is determined by the airway&nbsp;resistance, lung compliance, and chest wall compliance.</p><p>Modes of mechanical ventilation that can deliver VC breaths include volume-limited assist control and volume-limited synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation, which are described separately.

The ventilator provides the driving pressure for each breath, which determines the maximal airflow rate. Inspiration is terminated once the inspiratory flow has decreased to a predetermined percentage of its maximal value. Pressure support is a mode of mechanical ventilation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-mechanical-ventilation#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of mechanical ventilation&quot;, section on 'Pressure support'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">MODES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The modes of mechanical ventilation are distinguished from another by the types of breaths that they deliver. Common modes include assist control, synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation, and pressure support, although numerous other modes also exist (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F77391\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77391 \">table 4</a>). The modes of mechanical ventilation are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of mechanical ventilation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once it has been determined that a patient requires mechanical ventilation, numerous decisions need to be made including whether invasive or noninvasive mechanical ventilation is warranted, the mode of mechanical ventilation, the amount of support, and the initial ventilator settings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Invasive versus noninvasive</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mechanical ventilation can be delivered invasively or noninvasively. Invasive positive pressure is sometimes referred to as conventional mechanical ventilation or traditional mechanical ventilation. It is delivered via an endotracheal tube or tracheostomy tube. In contrast, noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) is delivered through an alternative interface, usually a face mask.</p><p>The decision about whether to initiate invasive or noninvasive mechanical ventilation requires that the entire clinical situation be considered, including the underlying disease, its severity, its rate of progression, and patient comorbidities. Generally speaking, a trial of NPPV is worthwhile in patients with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema or hypercapnic respiratory failure due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who do not require emergent intubation and do not have contraindications to NPPV (eg, altered mental status, abundant secretions, emesis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Invasive mechanical ventilation is appropriate for most other patients. Patient selection for NPPV is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-ventilation-in-acute-respiratory-failure-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive ventilation in acute respiratory failure in adults&quot;, section on 'Patient selection'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Choosing a mode</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The selection of the mode is generally based on clinician familiarity and institutional preferences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The modes of mechanical ventilation are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of mechanical ventilation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Level of support</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The level of ventilatory support refers to the proportion of the patient's ventilatory needs that are met by the ventilator. It is an important consideration because insufficient ventilatory support does not provide adequate rest for fatigued ventilatory muscles, while excessive ventilatory support has potential complications. These include respiratory alkalosis with subsequent intracranial hypertension, decreased oxygen delivery with resultant ischemia, and atrophy of the ventilatory muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. One study identified diaphragm atrophy and markers of proteolysis even among patients whose ventilatory support lasted less than three days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The optimal level of support provides enough rest for the ventilatory muscles to recover from fatigue, without allowing atrophy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiologic-and-pathophysiologic-consequences-of-mechanical-ventilation#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiologic and pathophysiologic consequences of mechanical ventilation&quot;, section on 'Diaphragm'</a>.)</p><p>The level of ventilatory support is determined by the mode and other settings. Generally speaking, assist control tends to provide the most support, synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation provides the widest range of support, and pressure support tends to provide less support:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of patient effort during assist control involves triggering ventilator-delivered breaths. Patients who do not need to trigger any breaths are receiving full ventilatory support, while patients who trigger some breaths are receiving somewhat less than full ventilatory support. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-mechanical-ventilation#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of mechanical ventilation&quot;, section on 'AC'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The level of ventilatory support can vary over the widest range during synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F64325\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64325 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Full ventilatory support is provided when the set respiratory rate is high enough that the patient does not trigger any ventilator-delivered breaths. At the opposite end of the spectrum, no ventilatory support is provided when the set respiratory rate is zero and all breaths are spontaneous. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-mechanical-ventilation#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of mechanical ventilation&quot;, section on 'SIMV'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pressure support cannot provide full ventilatory support because patients must exert some effort to trigger each breath. The amount of ventilatory support provided during pressure support ventilation is directly proportional to the pressure support level. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-mechanical-ventilation#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of mechanical ventilation&quot;, section on 'Pressure support'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Settings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are numerous settings that need to be considered when mechanical ventilation is initiated. These include the trigger mode and sensitivity, respiratory rate, tidal volume, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), flow rate, flow pattern, and fraction of inspired oxygen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Trigger</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two ways to initiate a ventilator-delivered breath: pressure triggering or flow-by triggering. This section discusses each.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When pressure triggering is used, a ventilator-delivered breath is initiated if the demand valve senses a negative airway pressure deflection (generated by the patient trying to initiate a breath) greater than the trigger sensitivity. A trigger sensitivity of -1 to -3 cm H<sub>2</sub>O is typically set, which means that ventilator-assisted breaths will be triggered when the alveolar pressure decreases to 1 to 3 cm H<sub>2</sub>O below atmospheric pressure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The trigger sensitivity should allow the patient to trigger the ventilator easily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A trigger sensitivity that is too sensitive may cause a breath to be delivered in response to patient movement or subtle pressure deflections caused by water moving within the ventilator tubing. In contrast, a trigger sensitivity that is not sensitive enough increases patient effort. This may cause a prolonged period between the initial effort and the ventilator breath or patient-ventilator asynchrony (see <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Asynchrony'</a> below). Pressure triggering can be used with the assist control or synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation modes of mechanical ventilation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-mechanical-ventilation#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of mechanical ventilation&quot;, section on 'AC'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-mechanical-ventilation#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of mechanical ventilation&quot;, section on 'SIMV'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Auto-PEEP (intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure) interferes with pressure triggering. Auto-PEEP refers to end-expiratory pressure that is created when inspiration begins before expiration is complete. The mechanism by which auto-PEEP interferes with pressure triggering is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=positive-end-expiratory-pressure-peep#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)&quot;, section on 'Potential sequelae'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When flow-by triggering is used, a continuous flow of gas through the ventilator circuit is monitored. A ventilator-delivered breath is initiated when the return flow is less than the delivered flow, a consequence of the patient's effort to initiate a breath (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F50688\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50688 \">figure 2</a>). During flow triggering, the trigger sensitivity is usually set at 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min,</span> which means that ventilator-assisted breaths will be triggered once the patient's inspiratory effort generates a flow of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span>. Flow-by triggering has been shown to decrease inspiratory work during continuous positive airway pressure and the spontaneous breaths of synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. This was demonstrated by studies that found that overall inspiratory effort was lower with flow triggering than pressure triggering during intermittent mandatory ventilation (IMV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>] and pressure support ventilation (PSV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], and unaltered during assist control ventilation (ACV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Thus, flow triggering is often preferred because it is associated with less inspiratory effort in several modes of ventilation, even though the effect is usually small. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-mechanical-ventilation#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of mechanical ventilation&quot;, section on 'Continuous positive airway pressure'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-mechanical-ventilation#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of mechanical ventilation&quot;, section on 'SIMV'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Tidal volume</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The tidal volume is the amount of air delivered with each breath. During volume-limited ventilation, the tidal volume is set by the clinician and remains constant. During pressure-limited ventilation, the tidal volume is variable; it is directly related to the inspiratory pressure level and compliance, but indirectly related to the resistance of the ventilator tubing such that the clinician typically changes the tidal volume by adjusting the inspiratory pressure level. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-mechanical-ventilation#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of mechanical ventilation&quot;, section on 'Volume-limited ventilation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-mechanical-ventilation#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of mechanical ventilation&quot;, section on 'Pressure-limited ventilation'</a>.)</p><p>The appropriate initial tidal volume depends on numerous factors, most notably the disease for which the patient requires mechanical ventilation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) &ndash; Randomized trials found that mechanical ventilation using tidal volumes of &le;6 mL per kg of predicted body weight (PBW; also known as ideal body weight) improved mortality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F87507\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87507 \">table 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F87147\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87147 \">table 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57072\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57072 \">table 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Low tidal volume ventilation in this population is described in detail, separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanical ventilation of adults in acute respiratory distress syndrome&quot;, section on 'Low tidal volume ventilation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-ARDS patients - The optimal tidal volume for patients who are mechanically ventilated for reasons other than ARDS is unclear. However, some studies suggest that the benefits of low tidal volume ventilation observed in patients with ARDS may also apply to patients without ARDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients undergoing abdominal surgery &ndash; There is a paucity of data on the optimal intraoperative tidal volume for patients who are mechanically ventilated during surgery. One randomized trial (IMPROVE) of patients at high risk of pulmonary complications following major abdominal surgery compared an intraoperative nonprotective ventilation strategy (10 to 12 mL per kg of PBW; no PEEP; no recruitment) with a lung protective strategy (6 to 8 mL per kg of PBW; PEEP at 6 to 8 cm of water; recruitment maneuvers every 30 minutes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. At seven days, lung protective ventilation was associated with a reduction in adverse pulmonary and extrapulmonary events (28 versus 11 percent), need for mechanical ventilation (17 versus 5 percent), and shorter hospital length of stay (mean difference 2.5 days). However, the lung protective strategy did not protect against the development of ARDS (3 versus 0.5 percent) nor was it associated with a mortality benefit. This study suggests that mechanical ventilation at 6 to 8 mL per kg of PBW is safe intraoperatively and may be associated with improved postoperative outcomes. Further analysis with randomized trials powered to evaluate the effect of intraoperative low tidal volume and lung protective strategies on the development of ARDS and mortality in surgical populations is warranted. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanical-ventilation-during-anesthesia-in-adults#H3186383247\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanical ventilation during anesthesia in adults&quot;, section on 'Lung protective ventilation during anesthesia'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">During low tidal volume ventilation, lung recruitment or the application of PEEP theoretically compensates for the compressive atelectasis that occurs in patients who have undergone abdominal surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. However, one randomized trial (PROVHILO) of 900 patients receiving low tidal volume (8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> PBW) intraoperatively reported no difference in postoperative pulmonary complications at five days between patients concurrently on high versus low levels of PEEP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. In addition, high levels of PEEP were associated with potential harm from hypotension. This trial and the effect of PEEP in patients who are mechanically ventilated intraoperatively and postoperatively are discussed separately.

Rarely should 10 mL per kg of PBW be exceeded. The tidal volume can then be increased or decreased incrementally to achieve the desired pH and arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO<sub>2</sub>), while monitoring for auto-PEEP and airway pressure. Return to the previous tidal volume is indicated if the patient develops auto-PEEP &gt;5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O or a plateau airway pressure &gt;30 cm H<sub>2</sub>O following an increase in the tidal volume. Large tidal volumes can cause barotrauma or increase the risk for ventilator-associated lung injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].

However, both analyses were limited by the methodologic limitations of some of the randomized trials and the inclusion of intraoperative patients and a significant percentage of patients from observational studies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Large randomized trials are required before extending the use of low tidal volume ventilation to all mechanically ventilated patients. However, based upon limited and extrapolated data, a tidal volume of approximately 6 to 8 mL per kg of IBW is a reasonable initial tidal volume, in patients without ARDS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F87507\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87507 \">table 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F87147\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87147 \">table 6</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Respiratory rate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An optimal method for setting the respiratory rate has not been established. For most patients, an initial respiratory rate between 12 and 16 breaths per minute is reasonable, although it may be modified according to the mode:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients receiving assist control, the respiratory rate is typically set four breaths per minute below the patient's native rate (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-mechanical-ventilation#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of mechanical ventilation&quot;, section on 'AC'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients receiving synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation, the rate is set to ensure that at least 80 percent of the patient's total minute ventilation is delivered by the ventilator (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-mechanical-ventilation#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of mechanical ventilation&quot;, section on 'SIMV'</a>)</p><p/><p>Once the tidal volume has been established, the respiratory rate can be incrementally increased or decreased to achieve the desired pH and PaCO<sub>2</sub>, while monitoring auto-PEEP. Return to the previous respiratory rate is indicated if the patient develops auto-PEEP &gt;5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. Other approaches are equally acceptable.</p><p>For patients with ARDS, the required respiratory rate is higher (up to 35 breaths per minute), in order to facilitate low tidal volume ventilation. Setting the respiratory rate during low tidal volume ventilation is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanical ventilation of adults in acute respiratory distress syndrome&quot;, section on 'Low tidal volume ventilation'</a>.)</p><p>Monitoring for auto-PEEP as the respiratory rate is increased should not be overlooked. In an observational study of 14 patients receiving low tidal volume ventilation, increasing the respiratory rate was associated with development of a mean auto-PEEP of 6 cm H<sub>2</sub>O [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Increasing the inspiratory flow rate and the respiratory rate simultaneously may mitigate the development of auto-PEEP.</p><p>Occasionally, patients may continue to have respiratory acidosis despite optimization of their tidal volume and respiratory rate settings. In this situation, permissive hypercapnic ventilation is appropriate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=permissive-hypercapnia-during-mechanical-ventilation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Permissive hypercapnia during mechanical ventilation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">PEEP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (applied PEEP) is generally added to mitigate end-expiratory alveolar collapse. A typical initial applied PEEP is 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O. However, up to 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O may be used in patients undergoing low tidal volume ventilation for ARDS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanical-ventilation-of-adults-in-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanical ventilation of adults in acute respiratory distress syndrome&quot;, section on 'Low tidal volume ventilation'</a>.)</p><p>Elevated levels of applied PEEP can have adverse consequences, such as reduced preload (decreases cardiac output), elevated plateau airway pressure (increases risk of barotrauma), and impaired cerebral venous outflow (increases intracranial pressure). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=positive-end-expiratory-pressure-peep#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)&quot;, section on 'Contraindications'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Flow rate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The inspiratory flow needs to be sufficient to overcome pulmonary and ventilator impedance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F74214\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74214 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F56464\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56464 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/13,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,31</a>]; otherwise the work of breathing is increased. The peak flow rate is the maximum flow delivered by the ventilator during inspiration. Peak flow rates of 60 L per minute may be sufficient, although higher rates are frequently necessary (eg, patients with bronchoconstriction). An insufficient peak flow rate is characterized by dyspnea, spuriously low peak inspiratory pressures, and scalloping of the inspiratory pressure tracing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p>The need for a high peak flow rate is particularly common among patients who have obstructive airways disease with acute respiratory acidosis. In such patients, a higher peak flow rate shortens inspiratory time and increases expiratory time (ie, decreases the inspiratory to expiratory [I:E] ratio). These alterations increase carbon dioxide elimination and improve respiratory acidosis, while also decreasing the likelihood of dynamic hyperinflation (auto-PEEP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=positive-end-expiratory-pressure-peep#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP)&quot;, section on 'Auto (intrinsic) PEEP'</a>.)</p><p>However, there are costs to increasing the peak flow rate. Increased peak flow rates can increase the peak airway pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In addition, the decreased inspiratory time lowers the mean airway pressure, which can decrease oxygenation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Flow pattern</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Microprocessor-controlled mechanical ventilators can deliver several inspiratory flow patterns, including a square wave (constant flow), a ramp wave (decelerating flow), and a sinusoidal wave (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F75089\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef75089 \">waveform 1</a>). The ramp wave may distribute ventilation more evenly than other patterns of flow, particularly when airway obstruction is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. This decreases the peak airway pressure, physiologic dead space, and PaCO<sub>2</sub>, while leaving oxygenation unaltered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The effects of the different flow patterns on potential complications of mechanical ventilation (eg, hemodynamic impairment, pulmonary barotrauma, ventilator-associated lung injury) are unpredictable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Fraction of inspired oxygen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oxygenation goals should be individualized. In general, the lowest possible fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) necessary to meet oxygenation goals should be used, typically targeting a peripheral arterial saturation between 94 and 98 percent, if feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. This will decrease the likelihood that adverse consequences of supplemental oxygen will develop, such as absorption atelectasis, accentuation of hypercapnia, airway injury, and parenchymal injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxygen-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oxygen toxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The oxygenation goal varies from patient to patient. As an example, a patient with ischemic heart disease requires greater oxygenation than a patient with chronic hypoxemia due to lung disease. As another example, patients with pulmonary hypertension also generally require and tolerate high fractions of inspired oxygen. Typical oxygenation goals include an arterial oxygen tension (PaO<sub>2</sub>) above 60 mmHg and an oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) above 90 percent. In patients with ARDS, targeting a PaO<sub>2</sub> of 55 to 80 mmHg and a SpO<sub>2</sub> of 88 to 95 percent is acceptable when the tradeoff would be higher plateau pressures and an increased risk of lung injury due to alveolar overdistension (ie, volutrauma) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/19,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,37</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ventilator-induced-lung-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ventilator-induced lung injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Few human trials study optimal levels of oxygenation in patients who are mechanically ventilated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-41</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One pilot study of 103 mechanically ventilated patients reported no difference in organ dysfunction, intensive care unit (ICU) mortality, or 90-day mortality in patients who were ventilated using a conservative strategy (peripheral oxygen saturation [SpO<sub>2</sub>] 88 to 92 percent) compared to a liberal one (SpO<sub>2</sub> &ge; 96 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Up to one-third of those studied had ARDS while the remainder had a number of medical (eg, ischemic heart disease) and surgical (eg, trauma) disorders, which limits the applicability of this study. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One single center trial of 434 critically-ill patients ventilated for respiratory failure due to a variety of etiologies randomized patients to a conservative oxygen therapy strategy (maintain a partial arterial pressure of oxygen [PaO<sub>2</sub>] between 70 and 100 mmHg or peripheral arterial oxygen saturation [SpO<sub>2</sub>] between 94 and 98 percent) or a conventional oxygen strategy (allowed PaO<sub>2</sub> up to 150 mmHg or SpO<sub>2</sub> between 97 and 100 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. A conservative approach to oxygenation resulted in a lower mortality (12 versus 20 percent) and fewer episodes of shock (4 versus 11 percent), liver failure (2 versus 6 percent) and bacteremia (5 versus 10 percent). However, this trial should be interpreted with caution since it was terminated early for poor enrollment, used a modified intention to treat analysis, there were baseline imbalances between the groups, it excluded patients with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and patients with exacerbations of obstructive lung disease, and the number of outcome events were small, all likely overestimating the benefit of the conservative strategy.</p><p/><p>The use of a conservative oxygen strategy awaits further study and clinicians should recognize that low oxygen saturations in ARDS patients receiving mechanical ventilation may be associated with neurocognitive impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. At the present time a conservative oxygen strategy cannot be recommended, particularly for ARDS patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. </p><p>Most experts agree that hyperoxia should be avoided. In a randomized, open-label trial of 442 mechanically ventilated patients with septic shock, setting the FiO<sub>2</sub> to 1 (hyperoxia) for the first 24 hours was associated with a significant increase in intensive care unit-acquired weakness (11 versus 6 percent) as well as a nonsignificant increase in mortality (43 versus 35 percent), compared with patients in whom the FiO<sub>2 </sub>was set to a target SpO<sub>2 </sub>of 88 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. However, the results should be interpreted with caution since some patients in this study may have also received hypertonic saline as part of their fluid resuscitation regimen. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">ASYNCHRONY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient-ventilatory asynchrony exists if the phases of breath delivered by the ventilator do not match that of the patient. It is common during mechanical ventilation: more than 10 percent of breaths are asynchronous in approximately 24 percent of mechanically ventilated patients, according to one observational study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Patient-ventilator asynchrony can cause dyspnea, increase the work of breathing, and prolong the duration of mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. It can be detected by careful observation of the patient and examination of the ventilator waveforms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Generally, the abnormality that is most readily apparent is failure of the ventilator to trigger a breath when the patient makes an inspiratory effort. There are several common causes of patient-ventilator asynchrony:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ineffective triggering of a ventilator-delivered breath &ndash; Ineffective triggering may occur in as many as one-third of inspiratory efforts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>] and may account for as many as 88 percent of asynchronous breaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. It may also prolong the duration of mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Ineffective triggering is accentuated by an insensitive inspiratory trigger, higher levels of pressure support, higher tidal volumes, and higher pH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Ineffective triggering implies the presence of dynamic hyperinflation, as indicated by auto-PEEP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The problem can be lessened or eliminated by increasing the duration of expiration by shortening inspiratory time, either by increasing gas delivery flow, decreasing tidal volume, or both. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Double triggering ventilator-delivered breaths &ndash; When this occurs, the ventilator delivers two breaths in rapid sequence (also known as breath stacking). This can be lessened or eliminated by decreasing the trigger sensitivity (eg, from -1 to -3 cm H<sub>2</sub>O).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolonged inspiratory time &ndash; Inspiratory time is the tidal volume divided by the inspiratory flow rate. Attempts to increase the minute ventilation by raising only the tidal volume result in an increased inspiratory time, causing patient discomfort and asynchrony [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/30,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,49</a>]. This problem may be avoided by increasing the inspiratory flow rate when the tidal volume is increased, so that the inspiratory time remains constant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p/><p>Breath stacking is a manifestation of asynchrony that occurs when a patient triggers a new breath before the completion of the prior ventilator-delivered breath. It is common during low tidal volume ventilation, a strategy that is typically used to mechanically ventilate patients with ARDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-mechanical-ventilation/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Lung volumes during breath stacking exceed the set tidal volume (even in heavily sedated patients), which undermines the strategy of low tidal volume ventilation. Increasing the set tidal volume may reduce breath stacking, but the advantages of improved synchrony must be balanced against the potential harms of using larger tidal volumes.
