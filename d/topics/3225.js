Excisional treatment can be performed using a scalpel, laser, or electrosurgery (ie, loop electrosurgical excision procedure [LEEP], also called large loop excision of the transformation zone [LLETZ]). There is no evidence that one technique is significantly better than another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-procedures-for-cervical-conization/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Since squamous lesions typically arise at the transformation zone, the procedure usually enables the pathologist to study an intraepithelial or superficially invasive lesion in its entirety. However, conization does not always remove the entire transformation zone or lesion. Excision is less likely to be complete in certain situations, such as pregnancy, or when the transformation zone is large or high in the endocervical canal, or when the lesion extends onto the vaginal fornices or very deep into the cervical stroma.</p><p>Ablative procedures, which are usually done with cryosurgery or with the laser, are an alternative to conization. However, no pathologic specimen is obtained since the cervical tissue is destroyed. These procedures are purely therapeutic and not of diagnostic value. They are appropriate for selected patients with previously well characterized lesions histologically and colposcopically, in whom invasive cancer has been excluded. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-ablative-therapies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Ablative therapies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OPERATIVE TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of cone biopsy is to remove the entire transformation zone. Too small an excision can result in inadequate removal of the lesion, while an excision that is too large can lead to immediate and delayed complications. The size and shape of the cone biopsy should be tailored to the individual situation and based upon careful preoperative colposcopy and good surgical judgment. Colposcopy in the operating room just before cone biopsy is not always practical, but may be helpful in many situations. Extending colposcopy to include evaluation of the upper vagina is worthwhile, especially in the presence of large, high-grade ectocervical lesions.</p><p>If the transformation zone and lesion are in the endocervical canal and the exocervix appears normal, the cone biopsy may be made narrower to preserve the normal ectocervical tissue, but should extend well upward along the endocervical canal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F52049\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52049 \">figure 1</a>). By comparison, if the lesion and transformation zone are largely confined to the ectocervix and the endocervical canal appears to be free of disease, then the cone is taken wide enough to clear the transformation zone with minimal resection of the endocervical canal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F52049\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52049 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vasopressin</a> and postprocedure packing decreases perioperative blood loss and menstrual symptoms. A systematic review of three randomized trials reported the following major results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-procedures-for-cervical-conization/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cervical injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vasopressin</a> before biopsy reduced perioperative blood loss in cold knife and laser conization.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Packing of the biopsy site with a rolled gauze dipped in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferric-subsulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferric subsulfate</a> solution (Monsel's solution) resulted in a twofold reduction in the incidence of secondary hemorrhage compared with lateral cervical sutures after cold knife conization.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Packing of the biopsy site with a rolled gauze dipped in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferric-subsulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferric subsulfate</a> resulted in a decreased risk of amenorrhea or dysmenorrhea compared with lateral cervical sutures at four months after cold knife conization.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Cold knife conization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cold knife conization is performed with a scalpel, almost always under general or regional anesthesia. The patient is placed in the dorsal lithotomy position. Many surgeons drain the bladder to protect against bladder injury. We, however, do not drain the bladder since we do not find this necessary for bladder protection, and catheterization may increase the risk of a postoperative urinary tract infection. A digital examination is not done and the vagina is gently prepared to avoid trauma to the cervix leading to possible difficulty with histologic interpretation of the specimen. A weighted speculum of appropriate length and narrow Deaver retractors are placed to allow visualization the cervix.</p><p>Colposcopic examination may be performed, and some surgeons use Lugol's iodine or 3 to 5 percent acetic acid solution to help demarcate the outer limits of the transformation zone. These procedures help the surgeon decide as to the size and configuration of the cone. Deeper cones (2 cm or more) are necessary in postmenopausal women undergoing conization because the squamocolumnar junction tends to move cephalad into the endocervical canal.</p><p>The anterior lip of the cervix is grasped with a single tooth tenaculum well outside the transformation zone, so as not to interfere with the excision. If room allows, a tenaculum placed on the posterior cervical lip is also helpful. In women with an abnormally shaped cervix (eg, &quot;fish mouth&quot; cervix), the specimen may need to be removed in pieces. The tenaculum is moved from one location to another to facilitate this. Although many surgeons recommend the placement of absorbable sutures at the three and nine o'clock positions just below the cervicovaginal junction (sutures placed too deeply may be cut during excision) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F82507\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82507 \">figure 2</a>), this has not been shown to be the optimal technique. </p><p>A vasoconstrictor solution may be injected into the cervix at this time, if there are no medical contraindications (eg, hypertension). Use of the solution reduces intraoperative blood loss and thereby improves operative exposure, allowing the surgeon to do a more controlled and accurate cone biopsy. We use 20 to 30 mL of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vasopressin</a> (0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">U/mL)</span> or 1:200,000 epinephrine solution injected with a 1.5-inch, 21-gauge needle circumferentially deep into the dense cervical stroma, just lateral to the planned line of resection.</p><p>A long-handled scalpel with a #11 blade is used to make a circumferential incision just lateral to the outer limit of the transformation zone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65918\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65918 \">figure 3</a>). Starting posteriorly, the scalpel blade is inserted to the desired depth and direction (in general, slightly toward the endocervical canal). Using a very slight sawing motion (more like pushing) in an attempt to keep the scalpel at the same depth and angle, the desired circular incision is completed. A uterine sound may help guide the path of the incision when a significant portion of the endocervical canal must be removed; care should be taken not to traumatize the endocervical canal. </p><p>An Allis clamp is used to gently grasp and manipulate the partially released specimen, being careful to avoid the mucosal surfaces (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F59404\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59404 \">figure 4</a>). Mayo scissors are used to complete and deepen the incision as necessary. The specimen is then removed by cutting across the remaining base with Jorghenson scissors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F54649\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54649 \">figure 5</a>). The residual endocervical canal is then curetted.</p><p>Routine dilation and endometrial curettage is unnecessary, except in women in the menopausal transition and postmenopausal women, those with abnormal glandular cytology, and women who otherwise have factors placing them at risk of endometrial pathology, such as abnormal bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-procedures-for-cervical-conization/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. In those patients in whom dilation and curettage is indicated, the conization is done first to preserve cervical architecture. </p><p>Optimal management of the cone bed is not well established. A variety of suture techniques have been described, such as a modification of Sturmdorf type sutures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F52788\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52788 \">figure 6</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-procedures-for-cervical-conization/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. We use these sutures when there is significant bleeding from the cone bed or when a large cone biopsy has been taken. There is some concern, however, that sutures placed into the cone bed may interfere with healing. Another hemostatic measure is to firmly place in the cervix a tampon or rolled gauze soaked in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferric-subsulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferric subsulfate</a> solution; the pack can removed by the patient pulling the string in 12 to 24 hours.</p><p>Alternatively, an open cone bed technique can be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-procedures-for-cervical-conization/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>]. This procedure is approached by obtaining spot hemostasis with electrocautery. A long, narrow piece of oxidized cellulose (eg, Surgicel) is then carefully packed into the cone bed and secured by tying the two lateral cervical sutures across the midline over the surgical pack (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F59131\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59131 \">figure 7</a>). The patient must be warned that she will pass this pack within one to two weeks. Ideally, the procedure is timed so that menstrual flow does not occur while the pack is in place. The vagina is generally not packed and the patient is sent home the same day or the next morning. </p><p>It is useful for the surgeon to measure the width and vertical depth of the cone specimen in the operating room and describe these measurements in the operative note. Measurements taken later, such as in the pathology laboratory, may be inaccurate due to shrinkage of the specimen.</p><p>If the cervix has a large defect, care must be taken in that area to not enter into the peritoneal cavity with the knife blade. Should this occur, laparoscopy to examine the pelvis may be indicated. Similarly, if the anterior cervix is absent and the blade is felt to have gone too deep, cystoscopy may be appropriate to examine the bladder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Laser conization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The laser cone is a more demanding surgical procedure than cold knife conization and requires a certain amount of expertise, both with cone biopsy and with laser surgery of the lower genital tract. Most laser conizations are performed in the operating room under general or regional anesthesia. However, there are a few reports of the procedure being done in an office setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-procedures-for-cervical-conization/abstract/11-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-15</a>]. This is only appropriate when a small or shallow cone is planned, the office staff is experienced, and the patient is cooperative and has some degree of pelvic organ prolapse. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-ablative-therapies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Ablative therapies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Protective eyewear is mandatory for operating room personnel. In addition, there must be close communication between the surgeon and the person assisting in the operation of the laser machine. Wet towels are placed externally, to protect the perineum and thighs from a misdirected laser beam. Paper drapes are avoided due to the risk of fire. Only the outer vagina is prepared. Speculums and tenaculums should be black to avoid reflection of the laser beam; both weighted and Graves speculums are available with a built-in hookup for suction. In the office, a Graves speculum may be used, but this author prefers a weighted speculum and Deaver retractors.</p><p>The cervix is infiltrated (as described above) with a vasoconstrictor solution. Under direct vision with the colposcope, a margin around the outer limit of the transformation zone is marked by making a series of dots with the carbon dioxide laser, set on intermittent power (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F68301\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68301 \">figure 8</a>). The diameter of the ectocervical portion of the cone should be kept fairly large because of shrinkage of the specimen, which does not occur with a cold knife cone. The recommended power density used for laser conization is generally in the range of 1000 to 1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">watts/cm<sup>2</sup></span>.</p><p>A very large cone may be required if there is extensive ectocervical disease that is clearly intraepithelial. Alternatively, the surgeon may elect to ablate much of the ectocervical disease in concert with a small cervical cone biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-procedures-for-cervical-conization/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. The outer and inner margins of the planned ablation are marked with the laser and divided into quadrants. Starting posteriorly, each quadrant is vaporized to a depth of 5 to 7 mm using a power density of 500 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">watts/cm<sup>2</sup></span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F53376\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53376 \">figure 9</a>). The external incision for the planned cone biopsy is made with the laser. This is done with a smaller spot size (0.5 to 1 mm) and a higher power density (1000 to 1500 <span class=\"nowrap\">watts/cm<sup>2</sup>)</span>.</p><p>A skin hook is placed on the freed stromal edges of the cone specimen and a tenaculum <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lateral sutures are simultaneously used to manipulate the cervix and exert traction. The laser incision is deepened to the depth and in the direction desired until the specimen is only attached around the endocervical canal. It is desirable to cut across this area with Jorghenson scissors, rather than with the laser, to reduce thermal damage of the endocervical margin.</p><p>Endocervical curettage is then performed. The careful application of spot cautery or the application of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferric-subsulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferric subsulfate</a> paste is most effective for obtaining hemostasis. However, a &quot;defocused&quot; laser beam using a larger spot size (2 mm) and a lower-powered density (200 <span class=\"nowrap\">watts/cm<sup>2</sup>)</span> can be used to obtain hemostasis at the cut endocervical margin and within the cone bed. An oxidized cellulose (Surgicel) pack may be tied into the cone bed when bleeding is more substantial. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Cold knife conization'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Loop electrosurgical excision procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP), also called large loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ), utilizes a very thin wire in the shape of a loop and modern electrosurgical generators that allow accurate and selective blending of the current. The loops are available in a variety of sizes, allowing individualization and avoidance of excessive excision (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80021\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80021 \">figure 10</a>). They are insulated along the shaft and crossbar to prevent injury to the patient and thermal damage to the ectocervical portion of the cone. A plastic or insulated speculum must also be used. A speculum that will connect to suction is helpful. The LEEP procedure can be performed in an office setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-procedures-for-cervical-conization/abstract/18-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-22</a>]. As with the laser cone, however, this requires a cooperative patient and a reasonable amount of room to work.</p><p>The cervix is assessed using the colposcope (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colposcopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Colposcopy&quot;</a>). The appropriate size loop is selected based upon the diameter of the lesion.</p><p>Analgesia is typically administered as a local anesthetic and vasoconstrictor solution (eg, 5 to 10 mL of 1 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> with 1:100,000 epinephrine), injected submucosally into the surface of the cervix (ectocervix) at the 3, 6, 9, and 12 o&rsquo;clock positions. Use of a local anesthetic with a vasoconstrictor is more effective at reducing pain than local anesthetic alone, based upon a meta-analysis that included two randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-procedures-for-cervical-conization/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In addition, the use of a vasoconstrictor reduces blood loss. Use of a topical anesthetic spray has been proposed to avoid the pain of injection. As an example, one randomized trial (n = 101) found no difference in pain during the excision for submucosal injection of lidocaine and epinephrine compared with topical lidocaine spray; however, blood loss was not measured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-procedures-for-cervical-conization/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The electrosurgical generator is set at 30 to 40 watts on blend 1. A blended current mixes cutting and coagulating currents. The higher the blend, the more the coagulating current and the greater the thermal damage.</p><p>The loop is carefully passed simultaneously around and under the transformation zone, thus excising it (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F81670\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81670 \">figure 11</a>). The loop should be allowed to glide through the cervix from one side to the other, allowing the cutting current to divide the tissue. If the surgeon attempts to pull quickly through the cervix, the loop will drag, bend, or adhere to the tissue, resulting in a shallower excision than was intended. If the loop moves too slowly, however, excess thermal damage to the specimen will occur. Occasionally, it is necessary to make additional passes in order to ensure complete removal of endocervical disease.</p><p>If preoperative evaluation showed that the lesion extends into the endocervical canal beyond the reach of the loop (ie, 5 mm), additional tissue may be excised from this area with a smaller-diameter rectangular loop [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-procedures-for-cervical-conization/abstract/12,19,20,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,19,20,25</a>]. Additional local anesthesia should be administered to this area before proceeding. Colposcopic reassessment can be done to determine adequacy of excision.</p><p>An endocervical curettage is performed following completion of excision, and hemostasis is obtained with a Ball electrode or regular tip cautery. It is also advisable to apply <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferric-subsulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferric subsulfate</a> paste to the cone bed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE INSTRUCTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient is instructed to avoid intercourse and place nothing in the vagina for two to four weeks. She is seen in the office at six weeks, to be sure the cervix is healing and the endocervical canal is patent. Assessment of cervical cytology and colposcopy are performed three to four months postoperatively. Specimens should not be obtained before three months because they are frequently contaminated with debris, metaplastic cells, and leukocytes, and thus difficult to interpret.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPARISON OF METHODS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The three conization methods (cold knife, laser, loop electrosurgical excision procedure [LEEP]) yield similar outcomes. A systematic review of randomized trials of conization for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) found no significant difference in the rate of hemorrhage or CIN recurrence among the three techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-procedures-for-cervical-conization/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Thermal artifact was greater with laser compared to LEEP conization (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.6-5.1).</p><p>There are procedural advantages and disadvantages of each type of conization method. Familiarity with all of these procedures allows the gynecologic surgeon to use the method that best suits an individual situation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F61097\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61097 \">table 1</a>). As an example, the laser allows greater flexibility in managing the ectocervical component of the disease because if its ability to combine the vaporization and conization techniques, while LEEP is readily performed as an office procedure. In addition, cold knife or laser conization usually removes a larger volume of tissue than LEEP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-procedures-for-cervical-conization/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. A cold knife cone avoids thermal damage to the margins of the specimen.</p><p>Choosing between ablative and excision methods is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-ablative-therapies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Ablative therapies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Intraoperative bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Major intraoperative complications are uncommon during cone biopsy. Bleeding is rarely heavy and conservative measures (eg, sutures, cautery, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferric-subsulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferric subsulfate</a> paste [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-procedures-for-cervical-conization/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]) are usually adequate for control of hemorrhage. The surgeon may resort to a cerclage-type stitch, internal iliac artery embolization or ligation, or hysterectomy if bleeding remains severe.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Uterine perforation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perforation is uncommon, but is more likely when the uterus is acutely anteflexed or atrophied (postmenopausal women). Perforation laterally may result in laceration of the uterine artery and broad ligament hematoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-procedures-for-cervical-conization/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Laceration of the bladder and rectum has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-procedures-for-cervical-conization/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Laparoscopy, or even laparotomy, may be needed to manage these problems. The likelihood of these complications probably does not vary greatly according to conization method. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-perforation-during-gynecologic-procedures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine perforation during gynecologic procedures&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Postoperative bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bleeding shortly after surgery may be due to inadequate intraoperative hemostasis or a result of vasodilation after the vasoconstrictor solution wears off. Delayed hemorrhage may occur one to two weeks after surgery, and is related to dissolving sutures or erosion of a blood vessel during the healing process. The incidence of postoperative bleeding following cold knife conization is 5 to 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-procedures-for-cervical-conization/abstract/5,6,30-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,30-35</a>]. This rate may be reduced slightly in procedures using the laser (2 to 10 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-procedures-for-cervical-conization/abstract/11,12,14,15,31,36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,14,15,31,36-38</a>] or loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP, 0 to 8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-procedures-for-cervical-conization/abstract/18-21,33,39-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21,33,39-42</a>]. Few comparative studies are available and possible contributing factors, such as cone size, are difficult to assess from published information. Early or delayed hemorrhage will often resolve with conservative measures in the office, such as application of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=silver-nitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">silver nitrate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferric-subsulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ferric subsulfate</a>, suturing, or packing. Occasionally, surgical hemostasis under anesthesia is required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of infection following cold knife conization is 0.2 to 6.8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-procedures-for-cervical-conization/abstract/5,31,32,34,39,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,31,32,34,39,43</a>]. The infection may manifest in a variety of ways, including local cervical inflammation, endometritis, parametritis, salpingitis, or pelvic abscess. The value of prophylactic antibiotics before cone biopsy is not known. They should be used in selected high-risk patients (eg, history of gonorrhea, pelvic inflammatory disease).

In the largest studies, the rate of cervical stenosis for each excisional procedure was: cold knife (8 percent; n = 100), LEEP (4.3 to 7.7 percent; n = 274 and 277), and laser (7.1 percent; n = 1218) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-procedures-for-cervical-conization/abstract/44-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-47</a>]. The most consistently reported risk factors for cervical stenosis in women who had undergone excisional treatment were amount of tissue removed (eg, incision depth of &ge;1 to 2 cm versus &lt;1 cm was associated with cervical stenosis) and postmenopausal status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-procedures-for-cervical-conization/abstract/46-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-51</a>].</p><p>Effects of conization on fertility and pregnancy are discussed separately.

It is less likely to be complete in certain situations, such as pregnancy, large transformation zone, transformation zone high in the endocervical canal, or extension onto the vaginal fornices. A full discussion of follow-up of women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and positive margins at conization can be found separately.

If a hysterectomy is indicated, it can be performed from immediately after conization until the inflammation begins (usually one to two days postoperatively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-procedures-for-cervical-conization/abstract/52-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-59</a>]. During this brief window, decisions regarding hysterectomy will need to be made based on frozen section or expedited final pathologic evaluation. At institutions with pathologists experienced in interpretation of frozen cervical specimens, cervical conization with frozen section before planned hysterectomy is safe and accurate when the histopathology is intraepithelial squamous cell disease, and avoids the administration of a second anesthetic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-procedures-for-cervical-conization/abstract/56,60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,60,61</a>]. However, interpretation of frozen sections may be less accurate in women who are pregnant or have adenocarcinoma or adenosquamous carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-procedures-for-cervical-conization/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Surgical therapy of these patients should be based upon results of permanent sections until data showing accuracy become available. If hysterectomy is felt to be indicated, but cannot be done within 48 hours, it is recommended that one wait approximately six weeks to allow parametrial inflammation to resolve. Should invasive cancer be found and radical hysterectomy planned, this can be done at any time interval, since the parametrium is to be removed.</p><p>The expedited approach is preferable if a radical hysterectomy is indicated following cone biopsy, depending upon the extent of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-procedures-for-cervical-conization/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].
