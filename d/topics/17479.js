TTE of the mitral valve is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-mitral-valve\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Echocardiographic evaluation of the mitral valve&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1\"><span class=\"h1\">MITRAL REGURGITATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mitral regurgitation (MR) is one of the most common derangements of native valves and increases in frequency with age. MR is broadly classified as primary, related to structural abnormalities of the valve itself, or secondary, due to impaired leaflet coaptation associated with underlying left ventricular disease or left atrial disease. Defining the morphology of the valve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79932\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79932 \">figure 1</a>) and the precise mechanism of regurgitation has gained importance in the modern era of surgical and percutaneous mitral valve repair. </p><p>The important role transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) plays in the evaluation of mitral regurgitation is due to the proximity of the TEE transducer to the left atrium. In situations that impede transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) (eg, acoustic shadowing from annular calcium or a mitral prosthesis), TEE provides an unobstructed view. TEE provides enhanced views of the mitral valve, which now include three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction to provide detailed information as to the nature of the underlying pathology. The TEE also provides information that is adjunctive to the TTE in determining the severity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32687970\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary mitral regurgitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted in the American Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/American</span> College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">(AHA/ACC)</span> guidelines, TEE is indicated in evaluation of patients with chronic primary MR (stages B to D) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F95916\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95916 \">table 1</a>) in whom noninvasive imaging provides nondiagnostic information about severity of MR, mechanism of MR, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> status of left ventricular function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-mitral-valve-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. TEE may provide significant additional information in the following conditions that lead to chronic mitral regurgitation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32687985\"><span class=\"h3\">Degenerative mitral valve disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This condition is the most common cause of primary mitral valve regurgitation. In most cases, the leaflets are thickened and redundant. It is usually an isolated condition but may also occur as a feature of disorders such as Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Prolapse may involve one or more of the three scallops of the posterior leaflet, the anterior leaflet, or both leaflets. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-diagnosis-of-mitral-valve-prolapse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and diagnosis of mitral valve prolapse&quot;</a>.) Mitral valve prolapse also occurs with relatively normal leaflets.</p><p>The most common mechanical complication of mitral valve prolapse is ruptured chordae tendineae. On TTE, the condition usually can be diagnosed by observing a flail portion of the mitral valve protruding into the left atrium in systole. A remnant of the severed chord can often be seen as a filamentous structure, moving with the flail portion of the leaflet. At times, it can be difficult to differentiate between the flail portion of the leaflet and a vegetation, although the appearance of the mass and the clinical setting usually aid diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonarrhythmic-complications-of-mitral-valve-prolapse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonarrhythmic complications of mitral valve prolapse&quot;</a>.)</p><p>TEE is also more precise than TTE in determining the precise location of the flail leaflet, specifically which of the three scallops of the leaflet is involved. The middle scallop of the posterior leaflet (P2) is the most common site of chordal rupture. This information is important in planning mitral valve repair. 3D TEE has provided greater specificity in localization of the pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-mitral-valve-disease/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Rheumatic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Post-inflammatory (ie, rheumatic) changes in the mitral valve are recognized by the same features in both TEE and TTE. Valve thickening, immobility, doming into the ventricle, chordal foreshortening, and calcification support this diagnosis. Usually, there is mixed mitral regurgitation and stenosis. Mitral regurgitation in this condition is characterized by restricted leaflet motion leading to malcoaptation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-mitral-valve\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Echocardiographic evaluation of the mitral valve&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Valve lesions related to systemic lupus erythematosus have been related to antiphospholipid antibodies, but this association is controversial; antiphospholipid antibodies can also occur in patients without lupus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-mitral-valve-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These lesions cause focal areas of thickening, which concentrate on the atrial aspect of the valve toward the tips of the leaflets, creating a club-like appearance. Occasionally, the lesions are associated with severe mitral regurgitation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=non-coronary-cardiac-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Non-coronary cardiac manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Congenital abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common congenital etiology of MR encountered in the adult is a partial or previously repaired complete atrioventricular septal defect (&quot;so-called&quot; endocardial cushion defect). The bridging anterior and inferior leaflets appear &quot;cleft&quot; and are frequently incompetent. TEE may be useful in defining both the site of regurgitation and the presence of residual septal defects. Other congenital causes of mitral regurgitation include the isolated cleft mitral valve and mitral valve fenestrations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Infective endocarditis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A common acquired cause of mitral regurgitation is endocarditis, either complicating an underlying valve lesion (eg, mitral valve prolapse with regurgitation) or causing primary destruction of a normal mitral valve, usually in the presence of a virulent organism such as Staphylococcus aureus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-and-outcome-of-infective-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications and outcome of infective endocarditis&quot;</a>.)

A meta-analysis suggested that a high-quality TTE has a strong negative predictive value for the presence of vegetations if there is no more than trace valvular regurgitation and no structural abnormalities of the valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-mitral-valve-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. TEE should be reserved for patients with indeterminate TTE and in cases where management would be altered by the findings. &#160;</p><p>In most cases, vegetations are found on the atrial aspect of the leaflets or on the leaflet tips. When there is secondary involvement of the mitral valve in patients with aortic valve endocarditis, vegetations can be visualized on the ventricular aspect of the anterior leaflet where the aortic regurgitation jet is directed; often, the valve perforates at this site. Studies using 3D TEE have demonstrated the utility of this method in identifying the mechanism for mitral regurgitation in the setting of endocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-mitral-valve-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Three-dimensional TEE has been shown to have greater sensitivity for detecting these non-bacterial vegetations on the mitral valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-mitral-valve-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

The typical lesion is characterized by focal areas of thickening concentrated on the atrial aspect of the valve toward the tips of the leaflets. These vegetations are usually sessile. Occasionally, severe mitral regurgitation is associated with these lesions. Three-dimensional echocardiography has been shown to improve sensitivity for detection of Libman-Sacks vegetations in patients with SLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-mitral-valve-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Calcification often obscures the presence of mitral regurgitation on surface Doppler imaging because of acoustic &quot;shadowing&quot; in the posteriorly located left atrium. TEE may be necessary to confirm the presence of mitral regurgitation in this condition, which can also cause hemodynamically significant mitral stenosis in the elderly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32688132\"><span class=\"h2\">Secondary mitral regurgitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Functional MR can be inferred when the valve is morphologically normal but the left ventricle is either globally or segmentally abnormal. The papillary muscles are splayed or displaced, leading to leaflet tethering, which can be symmetric or asymmetric. With symmetric tethering, as seen with global dysfunction, the color flow jet is usually central, occurring at a coaptation point that is marked by decreased contact area and displacement toward the left ventricle apex. With regional wall motion abnormalities, there may be asymmetric tethering leading to eccentric jets (eg, with ischemic MR). The role of TEE in the assessment of secondary MR is less well established. Exceptions include the diagnosis of papillary muscle rupture in myocardial infarction and chordal rupture associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32688062\"><span class=\"h3\">Ischemic mitral regurgitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most studies of ischemic MR have focused on chronic post-infarction MR rather than acute MR in the setting of acute myocardial infarction (MI, ie, with papillary muscle rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-mitral-valve-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]) or reversible MR caused by acute ischemia. Thus, the term &quot;ischemic MR&quot; is used by primarily to indicate chronic functional post-infarction MR. With ischemic MR, impaired motion of the muscle supporting one of the papillary muscles undermines the mitral apparatus, and MR results from systolic papillary muscle displacement and incomplete coaptation of the mitral leaflets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-mitral-valve-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

TTE is usually adequate to evaluate mitral regurgitation in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the mechanism of mitral regurgitation may be better elucidated by TEE. The mitral regurgitation usually results from systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. TEE may better characterize the degree of mitral regurgitation and exclude chordal rupture, a rare complication that causes acute severe mitral regurgitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-mitral-valve-disease/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].

Using this approach, mild (1+) and severe (4+) regurgitation are readily differentiated, but distinguishing between moderate (2+) and moderate to severe (3+) mitral regurgitation can be difficult. Evaluation of mitral regurgitation by TTE and TEE are complimentary with TTE providing quantitative parameters such as regurgitant volume and regurgitant fraction, and TEE demonstrating superior evaluation of valve morphology and jet characteristics. The limitations of TEE include: the inability to quantitate mitral regurgitation (specifically measurement of regurgitant volume and regurgitant fraction) and the need to provide conscious sedation for the procedure, which alters hemodynamics, sometimes reducing the severity of mitral regurgitation. This issue is especially important in patients with MR secondary to systolic LV dysfunction. An analysis from the Surgical Treatment for Ischemic Heart Failure (STICH) trial in 196 patients with TEE and TTE demonstrated that there is poor agreement between the two methodologies in this population of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-mitral-valve-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Color flow Doppler</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Due to proximity of the targets and the use of higher frequencies, color flow signals into the left atrium resulting from mitral regurgitation are well-resolved in a TEE examination. Most of the examinations listed below are conducted in one of the long axis views between longitudinal and transverse (0 to 110 degrees).</p><p>Features of severe mitral regurgitation by TEE color flow Doppler imaging arise from the high-energy transfer of a large volume of blood into the left atrium. However, even when imaging is optimized (shallow depth, narrow sector angle, low velocity filters on), the appearance of the regurgitant jet on color flow Doppler provides only an estimate of regurgitation severity. To recognize severe mitral regurgitation, the following color jet characteristics should be sought during a TEE examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-mitral-valve-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The proximal isovelocity acceleration of the jet (PISA)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The jet size, especially the magnitude of the aliased portion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The distance the jet penetrates to the posterior wall of the left atrium and whether it encircles the left atrium (the Coanda effect).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The eccentricity of the jet</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The width of the vena contracta</p><p/><p>One color Doppler sign usually present in severe mitral regurgitation is a characteristic proximal acceleration of the regurgitant jet appearing as a series of &quot;hemispheric bands of changing colors&quot; on the ventricular surface of the valve. The PISA can be used to calculate the effective regurgitant orifice area and to derive the regurgitant volume. In vivo and in vitro, this method has proved to be an accurate measure of mitral regurgitation severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-mitral-valve-disease/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>].</p><p>The use of PISA to calculate orifice area has been shown to have prognostic value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-mitral-valve-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, the method requires accurate measurement of both the radius of the PISA and the peak velocity of the regurgitant jet (continuous wave Doppler). These requirements are usually met by TTE but not by TEE.</p><p>In severe mitral regurgitation, at a Nyquist setting (aliasing velocity) of around <span class=\"nowrap\">55m/sec,</span> the diameter of the PISA ring closest to the regurgitant orifice is measured and usually approaches 1 cm. As the color jet crosses the defect in the valve, the width of the jet exceeds 5 mm, and as the jet enters the left atrium, the jet becomes eccentric and hugs the wall of the chamber (Coanda effect) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-mitral-valve-disease/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Once entrained on the wall, the wall jet may completely circle the chamber. The jet also tends to penetrate the atrial appendage and one or more of the pulmonary veins.</p><p>In severe mitral regurgitation, the color flow pattern in the left atrium demonstrates a mosaic pattern with jet direction dependent on patho-anatomic characteristics. Spontaneous echo contrast is rarely present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-mitral-valve-disease/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Any aliased eccentric jet, however small in apparent area, should be considered as representing hemodynamically significant mitral regurgitation until proven otherwise through careful evaluation of the multiple parameters discussed here. Central jets are most often associated with functional mitral regurgitation associated with symmetric leaflet tethering as observed in dilated cardiomyopathy. Although planimetered jet area is more valid in this situation, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be highly variable dependent on hemodynamic conditions.</p><p>On a technical note, the failure to carefully limit the area of color flow mapping results in low frame rates, low resolution, and excessive errors. The color flow examination should be directed only at the region of interest and cover as small a portion of the image fan as possible.</p><p>The eccentricity and width of the jet have proved more accurate than either the depth or area of the jet. Importantly, severe eccentric jets, such as those due to a flail leaflet, have smaller jet areas than central jets of equal severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-mitral-valve-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Using TEE, one study found that a vena contracta width of greater than 5.5 mm at its origin had a positive predictive value of 88 percent for grade 3 or 4 MR by angiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-mitral-valve-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. A second study found similar results using TTE imaging; a vena contracta width less 5.5 mm corresponded to a regurgitant fraction of less than 25 percent while a height greater than 8 mm corresponded to a regurgitant fraction of greater than 45 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-mitral-valve-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Pulsed-wave Doppler</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Color flow Doppler characteristics of the mitral regurgitant jet should not be used as the sole indicator of the severity of the regurgitation; spectral flow Doppler provides complementary information.</p><p>In the four chamber TEE view, color flow should be used to identify the most well resolved inflow diastolic signal. The pulsed wave Doppler sample volume should be placed between the tips of the leaflets. In severe mitral regurgitation, the velocity at peak inflow is almost always increased to greater than 1.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/sec</span>. A velocity of less than 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/sec</span> virtually excludes severe mitral regurgitation.</p><p>In addition to increased inflow velocity, the pattern is strongly E wave dominant, with a small A wave <span class=\"nowrap\">(E/A</span> ratio &gt;2). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Continuous wave Doppler</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several features are seen in severe mitral regurgitation upon study of the continuous wave Doppler systolic patterns of regurgitant mitral flow.

In mitral regurgitation, this evaluation is a standard part of the examination and usually includes the left upper pulmonary vein, from which flow into the left atrium is usually axial to the beam of interrogation. The right upper pulmonary vein is well visualized in a 90 degree orientation with anterior rotation of the probe. In hemodynamically severe mitral regurgitation, the flow in one or more pulmonary veins usually demonstrates systolic flow reversal, depending upon jet direction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-mitral-valve-disease/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>].

Of these 11 patients, five underwent mitral valve replacement, five underwent revision of the mitral repair, and one was managed with observation only. A predischarge TTE was performed in 132 patients; when compared to the intraoperative TEE, there was a discrepancy of 1 grade or greater in the estimated severity of MR in only 17 patients (13 percent).</p><p>3D TEE has been used for preoperative planning and intraoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-mitral-valve-disease/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].

As an example, detailed 3D analysis in ischemic mitral regurgitation has demonstrated differences between those with anterior and inferior infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-mitral-valve-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p>Immediately post-cardiopulmonary bypass, the repaired mitral valve is interrogated for residual regurgitation and other less common complications such as iatrogenic mitral stenosis (due to an undersized annuloplasty ring) or systolic anterior motion of the redundant leaflets leading to left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Postoperative hemodynamics must be considered in evaluating the adequacy of the repair. Post-pump hypotension may lead to an erroneous conclusion about the presence of MR after repair, and blood pressure should be normalized before surgical decisions are made. On the one hand, important regurgitation may be missed because of low afterload in the presence of low systemic vascular resistance. On the other hand, paradoxically significant MR may resolve once hypotension is corrected; in this case, the hypotension is usually due to decreased left ventricular contractility and will respond to inotropic agents.</p><p>When postoperative MR with systolic anterior motion of the valve leaflets is detected, the MR may largely resolve and systolic anterior motion may subside in response to decreasing catecholamines and increasing preload and rarely, if ever, requires further surgical intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-mitral-valve-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

It is a phenomenon associated with blood stasis within a cardiac chamber or vessel. It appears as smoke-like slowly swirling patterns in the left atrium. Spontaneous echo contrast is believed to be the result of erythrocyte rouleaux formation (ie, red cell aggregation) in the setting of sluggish blood flow and low shear rate conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-mitral-valve-disease/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Erythrocyte aggregation is mediated by plasma proteins, especially fibrinogen, which promotes rouleaux formation by moderating the normal electrostatic forces (due to negatively charged membranes) that keep erythrocytes from aggregating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-mitral-valve-disease/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. One study of 185 patients with valvular or nonvalvular AF found that spontaneous echo contrast was related to the presence of anticardiolipin antibody, a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and increased fibrinogen levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-mitral-valve-disease/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Spontaneous contrast should be considered as an important marker for embolic risk. The incidence of emboli in patients with this finding may be as high as 45 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-mitral-valve-disease/abstract/52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-54</a>].</p><p>Spontaneous echo contrast is common in patients with mitral stenosis. In one TEE study of 47 patients in sinus rhythm, 47 percent had this finding, which was associated with a smaller mitral valve area and a higher gradient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-mitral-valve-disease/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. In another series of 128 patients with mitral valve disease or a mitral valve prosthesis, one-third demonstrated spontaneous echo contrast; those with this abnormality had larger left atria, more frequent atrial fibrillation, and, most importantly, a higher incidence of left atrial thrombi (60 versus 28 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-mitral-valve-disease/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Interestingly, pure MR was never associated with spontaneous contrast in this report; however, others have noted spontaneous echo contrast in occasional patients with moderate or moderately severe MR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-mitral-valve-disease/abstract/52,57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,57,58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32688738\"><span class=\"h3\">Left atrial appendage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Determination of left atrial appendage function has a complementary role to spontaneous echo contrast in assessing embolic risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transesophageal-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-mitral-valve-disease/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].
