The severity and extent of esophageal and gastric damage resulting from a caustic ingestion depend upon the following factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Corrosive properties of the ingested substance</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amount, concentration, and physical form (solid or liquid) of the agent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duration of contact with the mucosa</p><p/><p>Most ingestion occurs in children and the remainder in psychotic, suicidal, and alcoholic subjects. More than 5000 caustic ingestions are reported annually in the United States; these ingestions are the leading cause of esophageal strictures in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Children frequently expectorate most of the caustic agent before swallowing, thereby minimizing injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In comparison, suicidal patients often ingest larger amounts of caustic agents than those who accidentally swallow these agents; as a result, they are likely to have more severe esophageal and gastric damage. Prevention plays a key role in reducing the incidence of corrosive ingestion, especially in children, yet this goal is far from being reached in developing countries, where such injuries are largely unreported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Caustic esophageal injury in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ingestion is usually accidental in children under the age of five and intentional in adults and adolescents. The most common cause is ingestion of strong alkali (sodium or potassium hydroxide) contained in drain cleaners, other household cleaning products, or disc batteries. The term &quot;lye&quot; implies substances that contain sodium or potassium hydroxide. Highly concentrated acids (hydrochloric, sulfuric, and phosphoric acid) contained in toilet bowl or swimming pool cleaners, antirust compounds, or in battery fluid are less frequently ingested. Liquid household bleach (5 percent sodium hypochlorite) ingestion is frequently reported but rarely causes severe esophageal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Button batteries contain highly concentrated alkaline solutions. Damage can occur from release of the alkali, local electrical current discharge, and direct pressure necrosis from the foreign body. When lodged in the esophagus, burns can occur within four hours and perforation within six hours; urgent endoscopy is indicated in this setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ingested-foreign-bodies-and-food-impactions-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ingested foreign bodies and food impactions in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alkali ingestions typically damage the esophagus more than the stomach or duodenum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F62223\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62223 \">picture 1</a>), whereas acids cause more severe gastric injury. Aspiration of either acid or alkali can also induce both laryngeal and tracheobronchial injury.</p><p>A study comparing outcomes of acid (mostly glacial acetic acid) or alkali ingestion found that outcomes were overall worse for those who ingested acid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Such patients had significantly more severe mucosal injury, were more likely to be hospitalized in the intensive care unit, were more likely to have systemic complications or perforation, and had higher mortality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Alkali-induced injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ingestion of alkali (such as ammonia or sodium hydroxide) acutely results in a penetrating injury called liquefactive necrosis. The injury extends rapidly (within seconds) through the mucosa and wall of the esophagus towards the mediastinum until tissue fluids buffer the alkali. In the stomach, partial neutralization of the ingested alkali by gastric acid may result in a more limited injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F62223\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62223 \">picture 1</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults#H33\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastric outlet obstruction in adults&quot;, section on 'Caustic ingestion'</a>). Duodenal injury is much less common, occurring in 30 percent in one series, in contrast to 100 and 94 percent involvement of the esophagus and stomach, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Extensive transmural damage may result in esophageal, gastric, or duodenal perforation, mediastinitis, peritonitis, and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This is most likely to occur with liquid preparations that coat larger mucosal surfaces. In contrast, solid lye preparations, such as disc batteries, induce more localized injury to the esophagus.</p><p>The process of liquefactive necrosis usually lasts three to four days and is associated with vascular thrombosis and mucosal inflammation, resulting in focal or extensive sloughing and ulceration. Over the ensuing two weeks, the esophageal wall becomes progressively thinner because of sloughing and the development of granulation tissue and fibrosis. Re-epithelialization is usually complete one to three months later.</p><p>The likelihood of stricture formation depends upon the depth of damage and degree of collagen deposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Death and severe complications primarily occur in patients with severe second-degree and third-degree burns&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Pathologic severity of injury'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Acid-induced injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acid ingestion typically produces a superficial coagulation necrosis that thromboses the underlying mucosal blood vessels and consolidates the connective tissue, thereby forming a protective eschar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Because acid solutions cause pain upon contact with the oropharynx, the amount of acid ingested tends to be limited. In addition, in contrast to the more viscous alkaline solutions, acid preparations tend to pass quickly into the stomach, causing less esophageal damage.</p><p>As the acid flows along the lesser curvature of the stomach toward the pylorus, pylorospasm impairs emptying into the duodenum producing stagnation and injury that is particularly prominent in the antrum. Food in the stomach tends to provide a protective effect. Nevertheless, acid ingestion in sufficient concentration can cause esophageal and gastric perforation with peritonitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathologic severity of injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Caustic injuries to the gastrointestinal tract are classified pathologically, similar to burns of the skin:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First-degree injury results from superficial mucosal damage and is characterized by focal or diffuse erythema, edema, and hemorrhage. The mucosal lining subsequently sloughs without scar formation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Second-degree injury is characterized by mucosal and sub-mucosal damage, ulcerations, exudates, and vesicle formation. Eventually, there is granulation tissue and then a fibroblastic reaction, producing a scar and possible stricture.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Third-degree injury is transmural and is characterized by deep ulcers and black discoloration and perforation of the wall.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features of caustic ingestions vary widely. Early signs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptoms may not correlate with the severity and extent of tissue injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Patients may complain of oropharyngeal, retrosternal or epigastric pain, <span class=\"nowrap\">dysphagia/odynophagia,</span> or hypersalivation. Persistent severe retrosternal or back pain may indicate esophageal perforation with mediastinitis.</p><p>Other findings that may occur include vomiting, hematemesis, and persistent, localized abdominal tenderness, rebound, and rigidity that may indicate esophageal or gastric perforation with peritonitis. Caustic injury to the oropharynx causes pain and inability to clear pharyngeal secretions with persistent drooling.</p><p>Hoarseness, stridor, aphonia and respiratory difficulties are less common and result from caustic burns of the epiglottis and larynx. Pulmonary aspiration leads to dyspnea. Fever, tachycardia, and shock generally imply the presence of more severe and extensive injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS AND STAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The absence of oropharyngeal burns does not preclude the presence of esophageal or gastric injury. Thus, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy should be performed during the first 24 hours after ingestion in order to evaluate the extent of esophageal and gastric damage, establish prognosis, and guide therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/6,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,13</a>]. Endoscopy is contraindicated in patients who have evidence of perforation. In patients who are hemodynamically unstable, endoscopy should be postponed until the patient is adequately resuscitated and is once again hemodynamically stable. If respiratory distress is present or there are signs of severe oropharyngeal or glottic edema <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> necrosis, the patient should be intubated for airway protection prior to continuing the endoscopy. In addition, extra care should be taken when performing an endoscopy in such patients because of the risk of perforation if the esophagus is similarly damaged. Modifications in endoscopic practice for symptomatic pediatric patients with a history of caustic ingestion have been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-adults#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency care of moderate and severe thermal burns in adults&quot;, section on 'Airway management'</a>.)</p><p>A grading system for esophageal injury to predict subsequent clinical outcome has been developed based upon a study of 81 patients with corrosive ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 0 &ndash; Normal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 1 &ndash; Mucosal edema and hyperemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 2A &ndash; Superficial ulcers, bleeding, exudates</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 2B &ndash; Deep focal or circumferential ulcers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 3A &ndash; Focal necrosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 3B &ndash; Extensive necrosis</p><p/><p>A modification of the burn classification, this system is widely used although its validity has yet to be confirmed in other prospective studies. The following correlations between endoscopic grading and prognosis have been observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/7,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,15</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with grades 1 and 2A have an excellent prognosis without significant acute morbidity or subsequent stricture formation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with grades 2B and 3A develop strictures in 70 to 100 percent of cases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 3B carries a 65 percent early mortality and the need for esophageal resection with colonic or jejunal interposition in most cases. In a large retrospective study, patients with grade 3B mucosal injuries were at greater risk of prolonged hospital stay (odds ration [OR] 2.4), ICU admission (OR 10.8), and gastrointestinal and systemic complications (OR 4.2 and 4.1, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p>A retrospective series with 49 patients with caustic ingestion graded the degree of esophageal damage using a scoring system based on the extent of esophageal wall edema and the adjacent tissue damage on thoracoabdominal computed tomography (CT) scans (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F90743\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90743 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Damage to the esophagus was correlated with the presence of esophageal strictures when the extent of damage approached grades III and IV. The CT grading system resulted in a slightly larger area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.90) for predicting strictures compared with the endoscopic grading system (0.79). </p><p>A case series suggested that endoscopic ultrasonography using a miniprobe may help predict the risk of subsequent stricture formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Strictures did not develop in patients without destruction of muscular layers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are very few randomized trials on the management of caustic esophageal injury. Current management is based upon clinical experience and data from animal models. The management of severe corrosive injury involves prompt resuscitation and urgent surgical debridement as needed. The subsequent restoration of continuity using colonic pull-up or gastrojejunostomy may be complicated and may not always be possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">General management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients suspected of having significant ingestions (based on history, symptoms, or endoscopic findings of grade 2B or greater injury) should generally be treated in a surgical or medical intensive care unit in order to manage the acute, life-threatening complications of injury (mediastinitis, peritonitis, respiratory distress, shock) and to decrease the risk of developing late esophageal strictures. Each patient must be evaluated individually since the clinical picture varies widely. Signs and symptoms alone are an unreliable guide to injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>If the patient is asymptomatic and gives a reliable history of a low-volume, accidental ingestion of low-concentration acid or alkali, endoscopy may not be necessary. Such patients may be discharged and followed as outpatients.</p><p>In all other instances, the patient should be hospitalized, kept fasting, and have serial chest and abdominal films taken. If the patient is hypotensive, intravenous fluids and blood products should be administered. Gastric acid suppression with intravenous proton pump inhibitors is often used to prevent stress ulcers of the stomach. Adequate pain relief with intravenous narcotics needs to be maintained continuously until the patient improves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Clinical signs of perforation, mediastinitis, or peritonitis are indications for emergency surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Broad spectrum antibiotics (such as third generation cephalosporins) are often given for patients with Grade 3 caustic injury or when there is a high suspicion for esophageal perforation. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis and staging'</a> above.)</p><p>For patients in respiratory distress, laryngoscopy should be performed in order to evaluate the need for intubation. Patients with oropharyngeal injury should be monitored closely for the possible development of airway obstruction. Examination of the oropharynx may reveal edema, erosions, or deep necrosis with grayish pseudomembranes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-care-of-moderate-and-severe-thermal-burns-in-adults#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency care of moderate and severe thermal burns in adults&quot;, section on 'Airway management'</a>.)</p><p>It is also important to recognize that certain agents and procedures are contraindicated in the presence of caustic ingestions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of emetics is contraindicated because vomiting re-exposes the esophagus and the oropharynx to the caustic agent, further aggravating injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neutralizing agents (weakly acidic or basic substances) should not be administered because damage is generally instantaneous. Furthermore, neutralization releases heat that adds thermal injury to the ongoing chemical destruction of tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nasogastric intubation to remove any remaining caustic material is contraindicated because it may induce retching and vomiting, which can compound injury and possibly lead to perforation of the weakened esophagus or stomach.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Endoscopy and subsequent management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endoscopy should be performed as soon as possible, ideally within 24 hours, in order to assess the magnitude and extent of injury according to the grading system described above (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F53058\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53058 \">picture 2</a>). The subsequent course is dictated by the results of endoscopy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with mild or no injury may be discharged.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with grade 1 or 2A injury require no therapy. A liquid diet may be initiated and the patient can be advanced to a regular diet in 24 to 48 hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with grade 2B or 3 injuries should have nasoenteric tube feeding initiated after 24 hours. Oral liquids are allowed after the first 48 hours if the patient is able to swallow saliva. Steroids are not currently recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Esophageal strictures'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with grade 3 injuries should be carefully observed for signs of perforation over at least a one-week period. Prophylactic esophageal stenting is not recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] although with the currently available self-expanding plastic stents, this practice may change [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In a pediatric study of severe caustic esophageal injury, the use of early (prophylactic) dilation did not eliminate stricture formation completely, but strictures resolved more easily with early bougienage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Esophagectomy may be required for patients with severe strictures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In addition, clinical signs of perforation, mediastinitis, or peritonitis are indications for emergency surgery. The need to perform surgery for caustic injuries has a persistent long-term negative impact on survival and functional outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In experienced hands, minimally invasive esophagectomy through a combined thoracoscopic and laparoscopic approach may be preferred because it is associated with a decreased hospital stay and more rapid return to normal activities compared with standard esophagectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Although it is associated with high anastomotic stenosis rates, transhiatal esophagectomy and gastric pull-up with cervical anastomosis is a safe procedure that can be performed for the treatment of corrosive esophageal stricture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. However, in the acute setting, patients are often extremely ill, and the surgical approach chosen should be based upon local expertise and the surgeon&rsquo;s assessment of which procedure is safest for a given patient. </p><p>Evidence of necrosis on computed tomography (CT), such as esophageal wall blurring, peri-esophageal fat blurring, and the absence of esophageal wall enhancement, may assist in the decision to perform emergency esophagectomy. In a retrospective study of patients with grade 3B esophageal necrosis, overall survival was higher in patients who underwent esophagectomy based on CT evidence of transmural necrosis compared with patients who underwent routine emergency esophagectomy (hazard ratio 0.43; 95% CI 0.21-0.85) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

If the stomach is damaged as well as the esophagus, a colonic interposition can be used to create a new conduit. If the stomach is undamaged, a gastric transposition can often be performed. However, in one pediatric report, gastric transposition was associated with a 5 percent mortality rate, a 12 percent leak rate, and 20 percent required dilation for stricture formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prognosis is variable and depends upon the grade of esophageal injury and the underlying medical condition of the patient.

Most clinicians wait three to six weeks after the initial injury before attempting dilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/8,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,20</a>]. Perforation occurs in approximately 0.5 percent of procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>]. The goal is to dilate the esophageal lumen to 15 mm and to completely relieve dysphagia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In one series of 52 patients with strictures due to caustic injury, these goals were achieved in 94 percent after initial dilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Long and eccentric strictures may require endoscopic dilation under fluoroscopic guidance in order to minimize the risk of perforation. In a prospective study, a vigorous schedule of combined bougie dilation and intralesional <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> injection <span class=\"nowrap\">(40&thinsp;mg/mL,</span> 1&thinsp;mL diluted in 1&thinsp;mL of saline, 0.5&thinsp;mL injected per quadrant of stricture) every week for five consecutive weeks was safe and effective in achieving significant dilation, reducing dilation frequency, maintaining luminal patency, and improving dysphagia for up to one year of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>The management of pharyngoesophageal corrosive strictures is more complex due to the site of stricture, the possible association with laryngeal injury, and the presence of downstream esophageal strictures. If an esophageal opening cannot be found endoscopically, a retrograde approach with a mini-laparotomy and gastrostomy should be attempted. If antegrade dilation is not technically possible, retrograde dilation is a viable option before opting for organ <span class=\"nowrap\">replacement/bypass</span> procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In general, the choice of therapy depends on site and length of stricture, time of presentation after injury, relationship of the stricture to the laryngeal inlet, status of the larynx and the airway, presence or absence of a lumen distal to the stricture in the cervical esophagus, and presence or absence of strictures further downstream. There are several options depending on the individual case, such as dilation alone, dilation followed by esophagocoloplasty, pectoralis major or sternocleidomastoid myocutaneous flap inlays with or without esophagocoloplasty, pharyngocoloplasty with tracheostomy, and neck exploration followed by esophagocoloplasty. According to one series, the overall results are excellent, with satisfactory swallowing in 88 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. A retrospective study compared the short- and long-term outcomes of colopharyngoplasty and esophagocoloplasty for caustic injuries of the upper digestive tract. Although the overall survival rates were similar up to 10 years after surgery, the quality of life and functional results were impaired after colopharyngoplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Thick-walled strictures are more difficult to dilate and tend to recur rapidly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Multiple sessions are usually required for adequate dilation and, in severe cases, elective esophageal resection with esophagogastric anastomosis or colonic interposition is required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Temporary placement of self-expanding plastic stents has been successful in case reports. Placement was curative, for example, in three patients with caustic esophageal strictures, all of whom were treated successfully without reintervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The stents were removed 2 to 13 months after placement with resolution of dysphagia upon follow-up of 26 to 39 months. A small, uncontrolled pediatric series suggested that stenting may reduce the need for surgical reconstruction of recalcitrant esophageal strictures after lye injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-benign-esophageal-strictures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of benign esophageal strictures&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Some patients with proximal strictures without tortuosity or a shelf proximal to the stricture can be trained to perform home self-dilation using appropriately sized (45 to 60 French) Maloney dilators. In a small, retrospective series, self-dilation was safe, well-tolerated, and effectively resolved refractory esophageal strictures with a median duration of self-dilation of 16 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Mitomycin</a> C has antifibroblastic properties and improves the success rate of endoscopic dilation of resistant esophageal strictures. A randomized trial with 40 patients assigned patients to dilation with application of mitomycin C or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Patients who received mitomycin C had higher resolution rates than those who received placebo (80 versus 35 percent) and required fewer dilation sessions (mean 3.9 versus 6.9). In addition, mitomycin C appears promising for long-segment strictures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Other drugs aimed at reducing fibrosis formation are being evaluated in animal models of esophageal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/51-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-56</a>].</p><p>Whether prophylactic measures can prevent stricture formation continues to be evaluated. Case series have described temporary esophageal stenting to prevent stricture formation, but experience is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/29,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,51</a>]. Early, prophylactic bougienage does not appear to prevent stricture formation, although strictures that develop may be easier to treat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Prophylactic systemic glucocorticoids do not appear to be effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. A randomized trial of glucocorticoid therapy for caustic ingestion in 60 children found that stricture formation is directly related to the depth of initial injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. In severe burns, glucocorticoids did not protect against stricture formation. Systematic reviews have also failed to show a benefit with glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/23,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,57</a>]. However, a subsequent randomized trial with 83 children did show a lower rate of stricture development in patients who received glucocorticoids compared with those who did not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>], so additional research is needed to clarify the role of glucocorticoids in patients with caustic esophageal injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=caustic-esophageal-injury-in-children#H145505684\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Caustic esophageal injury in children&quot;, section on 'Medication'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk for development of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is 1000-fold higher in victims of lye ingestion as compared to the general population (which carries an annual risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma of 2.6 per 100,000). In one study of 63 patients, the mean latency period for development of esophageal cancer was 41 years with a range of 13 to 71 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. A shorter latency period is more likely in patients who have a corrosive injury later in life. Corrosive-induced carcinoma can occur with a reasonably high incidence if part or all of the esophagus was left in place during reconstructive surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Nearly all reported patients with corrosion carcinoma had consumed an alkali, although two of three patients in one study had consumed acid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. The risk of gastric cancer does not appear to be increased.</p><p>Carcinoma at the site of previous lye stricture (scar carcinoma) tends to present in the early stages and responds better to combined surgical and radiation therapy. Two factors contribute to the improved prognosis in this setting:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The esophageal lumen at the level of the scarred esophagus is less distensible; as a result, dysphagia presents earlier in the course of the disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The scar tissue within the esophageal wall makes lymphatic spread and direct extension of the tumor less likely to occur before the appearance of dysphagia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/caustic-esophageal-injury-in-adults/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p/><p>Although the benefits of endoscopic screening and surveillance of patients who have had a caustic esophageal injury has not been established, recommendations have been proposed by the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE).

The severity and extent of esophageal and gastric damage resulting from a caustic ingestion depend upon: the corrosive properties of the ingested substance; the amount, concentration, and physical form (solid or liquid) of the agent; and the duration of contact with the mucosa. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Causes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The absence of oropharyngeal burns does not preclude the presence of esophageal or gastric injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of emetics, neutralizing agents, or nasogastric intubation to remove remaining caustic material is contraindicated. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'General management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In most patients, gastrointestinal endoscopy should be performed during the first 24 hours. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis and staging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endoscopy is contraindicated in patients who have evidence of perforation. In patients who are hemodynamically unstable, endoscopy should be postponed until the patient is adequately resuscitated and is once again hemodynamically stable. If severe respiratory distress is present or there are signs of severe oropharyngeal or glottic edema <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> necrosis, the patient should be intubated for airway protection prior to endoscopy. In addition, extra care should be taken when performing an endoscopy in such patients because of the risk of perforation if the esophagus is similarly damaged. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis and staging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with moderate to severe injury require management in an intensive care unit to monitor for potential life-threatening complications.
