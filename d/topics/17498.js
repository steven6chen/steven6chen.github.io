TTN is a common cause of respiratory distress in the immediate newborn period. In a review of 33,289 term deliveries (37 to 42 weeks), the incidence of TTN was 5.7 per 1000 births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-tachypnea-of-the-newborn/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Although thought to be a benign, self-limited condition, there are increasing data to suggest that TTN increases a newborn's risk for developing a wheezing syndrome early in life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-tachypnea-of-the-newborn/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The process of clearing fetal alveolar fluid begins before term birth and continues through labor and after delivery. During late gestation, in response to increased concentrations of catecholamines and other hormones, the mature lung epithelium switches from actively secreting chloride and liquid into the air spaces to actively reabsorbing sodium and liquid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57746\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57746 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-tachypnea-of-the-newborn/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Increased oxygen tension at birth enhances the capacity of the epithelium to transport sodium and increases gene expression of the epithelial sodium channel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-tachypnea-of-the-newborn/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Reduced gene expression of this channel contributes to the inability of immature lungs to switch from fluid secretion to absorption and can be upregulated by glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-tachypnea-of-the-newborn/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Passive resorption of liquid also occurs after birth because of differences among the oncotic pressure of air spaces, interstitium, and blood vessels. The majority of water transport across the apical membrane is thought to occur through aquaporin 5 (AQP5) water channels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-tachypnea-of-the-newborn/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Delayed resorption of fetal lung fluid is thought to be the underlying cause of TTN. Fluid fills the air spaces and moves into the interstitium, where it pools in perivascular tissues and interlobar fissures until it is eventually cleared by the lymphatics or absorbed into small blood vessels. The excess lung water in TTN results in decreased pulmonary compliance. Tachypnea develops to compensate for the increased work of breathing associated with reduced compliance. In addition, accumulation of fluid in the peribronchiolar lymphatics and interstitium promotes partial collapse of the bronchioles with subsequent air trapping. Continued perfusion of poorly ventilated alveoli leads to hypoxemia, and alveolar edema reduces ventilation, sometimes resulting in hypercapnia.</p><p>In one study, the expression of AQP5 was greater in patients with TTN than in those with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) or controls. This finding suggests that upregulation of AQP5 increases reabsorption of postnatal lung fluid, which contributes to the quick resolution of symptoms in infants with TTN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-tachypnea-of-the-newborn/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Decreased surfactant function has also been proposed as contributing to the pathophysiology of TTN. In one small study of term infants delivered via elective cesarean delivery, patients with TTN compared with age-matched controls were more likely to have lower surfactant function as determined by gastric aspirate measurement of lamellar body count and stable microbubble test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-tachypnea-of-the-newborn/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, further studies are needed to confirm these findings.</p><p>The role of nitric oxide (NO) in TTN has been the focus of studies as well. Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is an endogenous NO synthase inhibitor. Increased ADMA concentration may reduce NO synthesis, leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance associated with fetal lung fluid retention resulting in prolonged duration of tachypnea. In one small study, ADMA levels were elevated in newborns with TTN compared with healthy newborns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-tachypnea-of-the-newborn/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TTN develops in infants born prematurely or after cesarean delivery without labor because mechanisms to reabsorb alveolar fluid have not been initiated, as illustrated by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a review of 29,669 deliveries from 1992 to 1999 from a single center in the United States, TTN occurred in more infants after elective cesarean than after vaginal delivery (3.1 versus 1.1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-tachypnea-of-the-newborn/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a German study that analyzed data from perinatal regional registries of almost 240,000 term deliveries from 2001 to 2005, the incidence of TTN was 5.9 cases per 1000 singleton births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-tachypnea-of-the-newborn/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Elective cesarean section was the most significant risk factor associated with TTN compared with data from the national German perinatal registry (42 versus 9 percent). Other risk factors associated with TTN included being small for gestational age (SGA; 16 versus 10 percent), being large for gestational age (LGA; 14 versus 11 percent), and male gender (60 versus 51 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a multicenter Norwegian study, there was a twofold higher risk for pulmonary disorders (ie, TTN and neonatal respiratory distress syndrome [RDS]) for infants born after planned cesarean delivery compared with those born after planned vaginal delivery (1.6 versus 0.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-tachypnea-of-the-newborn/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p>TTN occurs two to three times more often in infants of diabetic mothers (IDM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-tachypnea-of-the-newborn/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infant-of-a-diabetic-mother\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infant of a diabetic mother&quot;</a>). The mechanism may be related to decreased fluid clearance in the diabetic fetal lung, although cesarean delivery, which is more frequently performed in pregnancies of diabetic mothers, is a contributing factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-tachypnea-of-the-newborn/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In addition, maternal obesity without chronic disease is associated with neonatal adverse outcomes including an increased risk of TTN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-tachypnea-of-the-newborn/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-pregnancy-complications-and-maternal-management#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in pregnancy: Complications and maternal management&quot;, section on 'Offspring'</a>.)</p><p>Maternal asthma is a risk factor, although the mechanism is unknown. In one study, infants of asthmatic mothers were more likely to have TTN than were controls (odds ratio [OR] 1.8, 95% CI 1.4-2.4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-tachypnea-of-the-newborn/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Moreover, another study suggested that in male infants, TTN may be a marker of deficient pulmonary function reflecting inherited susceptibility to the development of asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-tachypnea-of-the-newborn/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The administration of antenatal corticosteroid therapy appears to reduce the rate of TTN in late preterm and term infants. However, it remains uncertain whether the benefit of reducing TTN outweighs the potential adverse effects of corticosteroid therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antenatal-corticosteroid-therapy-for-reduction-of-neonatal-respiratory-morbidity-and-mortality-from-preterm-delivery#H2439085123\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antenatal corticosteroid therapy for reduction of neonatal respiratory morbidity and mortality from preterm delivery&quot;, section on '34+0 or more weeks'</a>.)</p><p>There are preliminary data that suggest a relationship between TTN and thyroid levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-tachypnea-of-the-newborn/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, further evidence is needed to confirm this association. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The onset of TTN is usually at the time of birth and within two hours after delivery. Tachypnea (respiratory rate greater than 60 breaths per minute) is the most prominent feature. Infants with this condition typically have cyanosis and increased work of breathing, manifested by nasal flaring, mild intercostal and subcostal retractions, and expiratory grunting. The anterior-posterior diameter of the chest may be increased.</p><p>Breath sounds in affected infants typically are clear, without rales or rhonchi. Infants with mild to moderate TTN are symptomatic for 12 to 24 hours, but signs may persist as long as 72 hours in severe cases. Infants rarely require a supplemental oxygen concentration greater than 40 percent to achieve adequate oxygenation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TTN is a clinical diagnosis. Characteristic findings on chest radiograph support the diagnosis. These include increased lung volumes with flat diaphragms, mild cardiomegaly, and prominent vascular markings in a sunburst pattern originating at the hilum. Fluid often is seen in the interlobar fissures, and pleural effusions may be present. Alveolar edema may appear as fluffy densities.</p><p>It has been suggested that lung ultrasonography is an accurate and reliable tool for diagnosing TTN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-tachypnea-of-the-newborn/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, more studies are needed to confirm these findings before recommending ultrasound as a diagnostic imaging procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-tachypnea-of-the-newborn/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p>Arterial blood gas measurements typically reveal mild to moderate hypoxemia and mild hypercapnia, resulting in respiratory acidosis. Complete blood count and differential are normal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TTN is a benign disorder, and pathologic conditions must be excluded. Because most of these disorders have overlapping clinical and radiological features, studies have looked for biochemical markers, such as endothelin-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-tachypnea-of-the-newborn/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>] or atrial natriuretic peptide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-tachypnea-of-the-newborn/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], which may aid in the differential diagnosis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pneumonia or sepsis should be considered, especially in cases that persist longer than 24 hours. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-pneumonia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal pneumonia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TTN is unlikely in infants who require persistently high oxygen concentration (greater than 60 percent) or mechanical ventilation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Affected infants also should be evaluated clinically for cardiac disease, and further studies should be undertaken if it is suspected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TTN may complicate respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in preterm infants. However, infants with RDS usually have a characteristic chest radiograph and more significant requirements for respiratory support.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because TTN is a benign, self-limited condition, management is supportive. Supplemental oxygen is provided by hood or nasal cannula to maintain oxygen saturation above 90 percent. Infants with TTN rarely require more than 40 percent inspired oxygen concentration. However, if the required supplemental oxygen concentration is greater or the infant has increased work of breathing as well as tachypnea, we sometimes use nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP).</p><p>Supportive measures include maintaining a neutral thermal environment and providing nutrition. Respiratory rates greater than 60 to 80 breaths per minute or increased work of breathing preclude oral feeding; orogastric tube feeding or intravenous fluids should be provided in such patients. If tachypnea persists longer than four to six hours or if the initial complete blood count and differential are abnormal, we obtain a blood culture and begin antibiotic coverage with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ampicillin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">gentamicin</a> while awaiting the results. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Furosemide</a> does not affect the clinical course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-tachypnea-of-the-newborn/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p>Fluid restriction may be beneficial in the management of severe TTN. In a trial of 73 late preterm and term infants with TTN, post-hoc analysis demonstrated fluid restriction compared with standard therapy reduced the duration of respiratory support for the subset of patients (n = 26) who had severe TTN (defined as requiring respiratory support for &ge;48 hours) without any adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-tachypnea-of-the-newborn/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. For preterm infants, the standard fluid management consisted of an intake of 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> and restricted fluid therapy of 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> for the first day of life. For term infants, standard therapy was 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> and restricted fluid therapy was 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> for the first day of life. However, further studies are needed to confirm whether or not fluid restriction is a safe and effective intervention for TTN.</p><p>There is no evidence that diuretic therapy is beneficial in patients with TTN. This was illustrated in a systematic review that identified two trials in which diuretic therapy had no effect on duration of symptoms or length of hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-tachypnea-of-the-newborn/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Ongoing research for therapies beyond supportive care for TTN continues. However, limited data on the use of inhaled corticosteroid therapy or beta agonists are inconclusive, and as a result these measures are not recommended for routine use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transient-tachypnea-of-the-newborn/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
