Firm data on the incidence of lung cancer in never-smokers is difficult to ascertain, because most population-based cancer registries, including the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database, do not collect patient smoking information.

The incidence of small cell lung cancer in never-smokers is exceedingly small [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-cancer-in-never-smokers/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], and this discussion will therefore focus on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).</p><p>In one analysis in the United States, an estimated 19 percent of women with lung cancer had never smoked, compared with about 9 percent of men with the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-cancer-in-never-smokers/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

A smaller study, in an area of China known for high rates of lung cancer in never-smokers potentially related to coal use, found very high rates of an otherwise less common EGFR mutation, G719X, and a 15 percent rate of KRAS mutations in never-smokers with lung cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-cancer-in-never-smokers/abstract/177\" class=\"abstract_t\">177</a>]. An analysis in the United States of over 800 patients with advanced stage NSCLC, of whom a third were never-smokers, found only a 4 percent rate of KRAS mutations, but a 49 percent rate of EGFR mutations in lung cancers from never-smokers, compared with 15 percent KRAS and approximately 30 percent EGFR mutations in those with up to 15 pack-years of smoking history, and 40 percent KRAS and only 11 percent EGFR mutations in those with at least a 15 pack-year smoking history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-cancer-in-never-smokers/abstract/178\" class=\"abstract_t\">178</a>]. This provides further support to the assertion that targetable oncogenic mutant kinases can now be identified in the majority of lung adenocarcinomas from never-smokers, especially in East Asian patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT AND PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whether or not patients with non-small cell lung cancer who are never-smokers have a better response to standard treatment <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a better prognosis than those with a positive smoking history is uncertain. Some observational studies have demonstrated a better outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-cancer-in-never-smokers/abstract/27,179-183\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,179-183</a>], although this has not been true in all studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-cancer-in-never-smokers/abstract/184-186\" class=\"abstract_t\">184-186</a>]. </p><p>As an example, in an analysis of 12,000 patients from California, smokers had a shorter survival compared to never-smokers (hazard ratio for death 1.09, 95% CI 1.00-1.18) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-cancer-in-never-smokers/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Similarly, in another study of patients with lung adenocarcinoma comparing 132 never-smokers with 522 current smokers, it was found that the five-year survival was significantly better among never-smokers (23 versus 16 percent), a difference that was significant on multivariate analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-cancer-in-never-smokers/abstract/179\" class=\"abstract_t\">179</a>]. In contrast, in another study of 254 patients with lung cancer, the five-year survival was not significantly different in never-smokers compared to smokers (27 versus 31 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-cancer-in-never-smokers/abstract/184\" class=\"abstract_t\">184</a>]. More recently, a much larger lung cancer registry trial, which included over 15,000 Japanese and over 13,000 Caucasian patients from Southern California, demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in survival for the patients with no smoking history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-cancer-in-never-smokers/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In an expanded analysis of 26,957 NSCLC patients from Japan, the median overall survival was significantly longer for never-smokers compared to ever smokers (30 versus 19 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-cancer-in-never-smokers/abstract/187\" class=\"abstract_t\">187</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">EGFR inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinically important differences in treatment response are seen with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=erlotinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erlotinib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gefitinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gefitinib</a>). Higher response rates and better survival have been reported in never-smokers with these drugs compared to current or former smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-cancer-in-never-smokers/abstract/144,188,189\" class=\"abstract_t\">144,188,189</a>].</p><p>In the phase III trial in which <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gefitinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gefitinib</a> was compared to supportive case as second-line therapy in patients with advanced NSCLC, a statistically significant survival benefit was seen in never-smokers (HR 0.67 compared to supportive care) while the survival difference in ever smokers was not significant (HR 0.92) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-cancer-in-never-smokers/abstract/188\" class=\"abstract_t\">188</a>]. Similarly, in the phase III trial in which <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erlotinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erlotinib</a> was compared with supportive care, a history of never smoking was a significant independent predictor of improved survival with erlotinib therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-cancer-in-never-smokers/abstract/189\" class=\"abstract_t\">189</a>]. These trials are discussed in more detail separately. </p><p>However, never smoking status is likely a surrogate for EGFR activating mutations, which are a very strong predictor of response with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The iPASS and First-Signal trials comparing first-line <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gefitinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gefitinib</a> versus chemotherapy for never-smoking Asian patients with advanced stage NSCLC emphasize this point [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-cancer-in-never-smokers/abstract/190,191\" class=\"abstract_t\">190,191</a>]. In both studies, high frequencies of EGFR mutations were found among never-smokers, and gefitinib conferred an overall progression-free survival (PFS) benefit. In both studies, only those with the mutations had a PFS benefit with the EGFR-TKI when the patients were divided into those with and without EGFR activating mutations, and those without the mutations did better with first-line chemotherapy.

The best understood of these are the abnormalities in the EGFR pathway. These EGFR pathway abnormalities seen in never-smokers have been associated with a particular responsiveness to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erlotinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erlotinib</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gefitinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gefitinib</a>, agents that inhibit EGFR tyrosine kinase. The ALK fusion oncogene is another molecular variant in NSCLC that is seen more frequently in never-smokers and for which targeted therapy is now available.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Brambilla E, Travis WD.
