Immunosuppressive regimens can also play a major role on the impact of CMV replication in lung transplant recipients. In particular, the use of anti-lymphocyte antibodies as induction therapy or for the treatment of steroid-resistant rejection has been strongly associated with the development of CMV disease in certain recipients (CMV <span class=\"nowrap\">D+/R-,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">D-/R+,</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">D+/R+)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-lung-transplant-recipients/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].

The most important risk factor for CMV infection and disease is organ donor (D) and recipient (R) serostatus, with CMV <span class=\"nowrap\">D+/R-</span> recipients at the highest risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-lung-transplant-recipients/abstract/8,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,17</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H572572\" class=\"local\">'Universal prophylaxis'</a> below.)</p><p>The lung has been identified as a major site of CMV latency and recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-lung-transplant-recipients/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Lung transplantation is associated with the transfer of a larger CMV load than other solid organs and, as a result, the risk of CMV infection and disease is greater than in other solid organ transplant recipients. Therefore, most lung transplant programs employ aggressive preventive measures for all D+ or R+ lung transplant recipients.</p><p>Serologic status impacts the risk of CMV infection as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">D+/R-:</strong></span> CMV <span class=\"nowrap\">D+/R-</span> recipients are at the greatest risk CMV, with infection occurring in up to 71 percent of recipients with 85 percent of infected individuals developing disease. The case-fatality rate of patients with CMV disease has approached 22 percent but, due to the availability of potent antiviral agents, mortality has been substantially reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-lung-transplant-recipients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In a single-center series, the survival rate for CMV-mismatched recipients was similar to that for other donor-recipient serologic combinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-lung-transplant-recipients/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">D-/R+</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">D+/R+:</strong></span> Early studies have suggested that CMV infection develops in approximately 58 and 69 percent of CMV <span class=\"nowrap\">D-/R+</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">D+/R+</span> recipients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-lung-transplant-recipients/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The risk is higher in the latter group because reactivation as well as superinfection with a new virus strain can occur. However, more recent reports in the era of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valganciclovir</a> prophylaxis found that the risk of infection or disease is much less in <span class=\"nowrap\">D-/R+</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">D+/R+</span> patients, particularly in <span class=\"nowrap\">D-/R+</span> recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-lung-transplant-recipients/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. In one study, during the 180 day period following six months of CMV prophylaxis, the incidence of CMV infection or disease was 6 percent in <span class=\"nowrap\">D-/R+</span> recipients and 34 percent in <span class=\"nowrap\">D+/R+</span> recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-lung-transplant-recipients/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Seronegative recipients should also be tested on the day of transplantation prior to going to the operating room to correctly assign risk. Only CMV IgG should be tested for, rather than IgM or a combination of IgM and IgG, since false-positive IgM results might reduce the specificity of screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-lung-transplant-recipients/abstract/1,2,25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,25-27</a>].

The available assays have improved considerably in recent years but continue to have important limitations. Tests for CMV replication include CMV load assays and CMV pp65 antigenemia. PCR using an international standard composed of a standardized amount of CMV has been widely adopted, and use of this test is now recommended instead of CMV pp65 antigenemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-lung-transplant-recipients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. We favor using a whole-blood quantitative PCR-based assay. Once a specific assay and type of specimen have been used in a given patient, the same methods should be used for subsequent monitoring, given the differences in results based on specimen type.

In contrast, patients who are CMV-seropositive or who received an organ from a CMV-seropositive donor who are being managed with a preemptive approach must undergo frequent monitoring for CMV infection. In such patients, monitoring should be done weekly during the first three months following transplantation and during episodes of acute rejection, the periods of highest risk for viral replication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-lung-transplant-recipients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In patients who do not have evidence of CMV replication, the frequency of monitoring can be reduced to every two weeks from three until six months posttransplant, and monthly thereafter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-lung-transplant-recipients/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Results of this monitoring should be used to guide therapy. (See <a href=\"#H1635497496\" class=\"local\">'Preemptive therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H164450485\"><span class=\"h2\">CMV-specific immunity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assays for assessing CMV-specific T cell responses have been developed to predict which patients are at increased risk for CMV disease following transplantation and are used at some transplant centers outside the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-lung-transplant-recipients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Tests include a QuantiFERON assay, an ELISpot assay, major histocompatibility complex multimer staining assays, and intracellular cytokine staining assays. Such assays may be particularly useful in combination with viral load monitoring in high-risk (eg, CMV <span class=\"nowrap\">D+/R-)</span> solid organ transplant recipients following the completion of antiviral prophylaxis. As an example, a QuantiFERON CMV assay has been evaluated for assessing CMV-specific cell-mediated immunity in whole blood specimens by measuring interferon-gamma levels following in vitro stimulation with CMV antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-lung-transplant-recipients/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In a prospective multicenter cohort study, 127 CMV <span class=\"nowrap\">D+/R-</span> solid organ transplant recipients (including 14 lung transplant recipients) receiving antiviral prophylaxis for a median of 98 days underwent testing at the end of prophylaxis and one and two months later. At 12 months, patients with a positive result had a significantly lower risk of CMV disease than patients with a negative or indeterminate result (6 versus 22 versus 58 percent, respectively).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1635497466\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION OF DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because CMV causes considerable morbidity and mortality and has been identified as a risk factor for chronic rejection in lung transplant recipients, there has been intense interest in prevention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-lung-transplant-recipients/abstract/1,8,21,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8,21,29</a>]. Two strategies have been used:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Universal prophylaxis</strong> of recipients at high risk for infection (ie, all but CMV donor-negative, recipient-negative [CMV <span class=\"nowrap\">D-/R-]</span> recipients).

Using this approach, patients are monitored frequently with a CMV load or antigenemia assay, and oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valganciclovir</a> is initiated when viral replication has reached a certain assay threshold defined at each institution.</p><p/><p>Given the high risk of CMV disease in lung transplant recipients, we favor antiviral prophylaxis over preemptive therapy in all lung transplant recipients who are CMV-seropositive or who received an organ from a CMV-seropositive donor (CMV <span class=\"nowrap\">D+/R+,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">D-/R+,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">D+/R-)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-lung-transplant-recipients/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The use of antiviral prophylaxis in seropositive lung transplant recipients is also endorsed by the 2013 International Consensus Guidelines on the Management of Cytomegalovirus in Solid Organ Transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-lung-transplant-recipients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] and by the 2013 guidelines for the management of CMV in solid organ transplantation published by the American Society of Transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-lung-transplant-recipients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Support for the use of universal prophylaxis is based on a substantial body of published evidence in lung transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-lung-transplant-recipients/abstract/1,2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,8</a>]. There is a paucity of evidence on the safety and efficacy of preemptive therapy compared with that of universal prophylaxis in lung transplant recipients. Furthermore, few studies have directly compared universal prophylaxis to preemptive therapy in this population.</p><p>Several studies have compared preemptive and prophylactic strategies in solid organ transplant recipients, but the majority of patients in these studies have been renal transplant recipients, and few lung transplant recipients have been included. The results of these studies might not apply to lung transplant recipients, who have a higher risk of CMV infection and disease than renal transplant recipients.

Preemptive therapy has some potential advantages over universal prophylaxis. Because only recipients with infection receive preemptive therapy, fewer patients are treated for a shorter duration. The net decrease in drug usage and exposure could decrease costs, drug-related toxicity, catheter-related complications, and the evolution of drug-resistant strains of CMV. However, preemptive therapy is not used commonly in lung transplant recipients during the early posttransplant period, given the high risk of CMV infection in such patients and the limited data about its efficacy in this population.
