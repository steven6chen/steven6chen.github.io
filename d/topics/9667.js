It is also commonly referred to as congenitally corrected TGA, double discordance, or ventricular inversion.</p><p>L-TGA usually does not present with cyanosis unless there are associated cardiac defects. Isolated L-TGA is &quot;physiologically corrected&quot; because systemic deoxygenated venous blood returns to the pulmonary circulation and oxygenated pulmonary venous blood returns to the systemic circulation. Patients with L-TGA are at increased risk for heart failure as adults due to progressive decline in systemic right ventricular function.</p><p>The pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of L-TGA will be presented here. D-TGA is discussed separately.

Normally, the primitive heart tube &quot;loops&quot; to the right (dextro or D loop) resulting in the normal morphologic position of the right ventricle (RV) to the right of the left ventricle (LV). However, looping to the left (levo or L loop) leads to abnormal positioning of the ventricles and to abnormal connections among the atrial, ventricular, and arterial segments of the heart.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H151925595\"><span class=\"h2\">Anatomy of L-TGA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>L-TGA is due to the abnormal leftward looping of the primitive heart, which results in the morphologic LV being positioned to the right of the morphologic RV, and to both atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial discordance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F83845\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83845 \">figure 1</a>). In this lesion, deoxygenated systemic venous blood return flows from the correctly located right atrium to the discordant LV via the mitral valve, and into the lung through the pulmonary arteries. Oxygenated blood flows from the lungs through the pulmonary veins to the left atrium into the discordant RV via the tricuspid valve, and returns to the systemic circulation through the aorta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/l-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The aorta is typically abnormally positioned anterior and to the left of the pulmonary artery.</p><p>L-TGA is commonly referred to as congenitally corrected TGA, as the blood flows in the correct physiologic direction resulting in normal oxygenation of the systemic venous return via the abnormally placed ventricles and great arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/l-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Dextrocardia and situs inversus (where the heart is positioned and oriented in the right chest and there is inversion of the abdominal viscera) is another much less common variant of a congenitally corrected TGA. It is an anatomic mirror image of L-TGA and accounted for 2 out of 22 cases in a New Zealand case series of congenitally corrected TGA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/l-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Although the anatomy of this lesion is different, the pathophysiology is the same. As a result, case series often combine the two entities in describing both the natural history and surgical outcome. In this topic review, L-TGA will be used to describe both anatomic variants.</p><p>Other terms used to describe L-TGA include ventricular inversion (referring to the reversal of ventricular positioning) and double discordance (referring to both the atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial discordance).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H156826138\"><span class=\"h3\">Coronary artery anatomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with L-TGA, coronary artery anatomy is variable. In general, the usual distribution represents a mirror image of normal anatomy with the origins of the coronary arteries arising from the posterior facing sinuses due to the anterior positioning of the aortic valve. The vessel originating from the right-sided sinus is considered the morphologic left coronary artery with a circumflex and anterior descending branch, while the vessel originating from the left-facing sinus would have the epicardial distribution of a morphologic right coronary artery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17851656\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the cause of L-TGA is unknown, limited data suggest both environmental and genetic factors contribute to its pathogenesis, as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A case-control study from the Baltimore Washington Infant Study evaluated personal and occupational exposure data from 3495 live births between 1981 and 1989 including 36 infants with L-TGA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/l-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Over three-quarters of the cases of L-TGA occurred in two small contiguous regions of Maryland and Washington, DC. These two areas were characterized by release of toxic chemicals into the air and by hazardous waste sites. In addition, parental exposures to hair dye, smoking, and laboratory chemicals were more likely in infants with L-TGA than in the overall cohort. These results suggest that L-TGA was associated with increased exposure to environmental toxins.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two case series reported a risk of 2 to 5 percent of L-TGA in siblings of affected patients, lending support to a genetic pathogenetic component [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/l-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H151925122\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>L-TGA is a rare form of congenital heart disease with a published incidence ranging from 0.02 to 0.07 per 1000 live births,<sup> </sup>accounting for less than 1 percent of congenital heart lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/l-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17851677\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term congenitally or physiologically corrected transposition of the great arteries is used to describe the normal physiologic return of deoxygenated systemic venous blood to the heart and transport of oxygenated pulmonary venous return to the systemic circulation through the discordant ventricles and great arteries. As a result, patients with isolated L-TGA are asymptomatic at birth and during childhood.</p><p>However, isolated L-TGA is rare, as associated cardiac lesions are present in over 90 percent of patients with L-TGA. In these patients, signs or symptoms are due to the pathophysiology of the associated cardiac defects. (See <a href=\"#H151925319\" class=\"local\">'Associated cardiac abnormalities'</a> below.)</p><p>In patients with anatomically uncorrected L-TGA (ie, persistent atrioventricular and ventriculoarterial discordance), the morphologic right ventricle (RV) is not well suited to perform the workload of the systemic ventricle over a normal lifespan. As a result, systemic ventricular failure (ie, systemic heart failure) is a common late complication in L-TGA patients including those without associated cardiac lesions. Right ventricular dysfunction is thought to be due to an unfavorable tripartite geometric configuration that does not adapt to pressure or volume overload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/l-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The long-term systemic workload results in progressive tricuspid regurgitation that increases volume overload and contributes to ventricular dysfunction and failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/l-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. It is also proposed that the single coronary arterial supply to the morphologic RV may increase the vulnerability of this ventricle to ischemia, particularly when hypertrophy is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/l-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17851684\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17851693\"><span class=\"h2\">Antenatal presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because prenatal diagnosis of L-TGA is challenging, most patients with L-TGA present after delivery. In one case series, 16 of 54 patients were diagnosed prenatally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/l-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Of the 16 fetuses, one pregnancy was terminated, one fetus had an unknown outcome, and the other 14 were live born. (See <a href=\"#H17851723\" class=\"local\">'Fetal diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-cardiac-abnormalities-screening-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management#H184751909\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal cardiac abnormalities: Screening, evaluation, and pregnancy management&quot;, section on 'Basic fetal cardiac evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17851700\"><span class=\"h2\">Postnatal presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The postnatal presentation of L-TGA is dependent on the presence and type of additional cardiac abnormalities. Patients without another structural cardiac lesion are asymptomatic at birth. L-TGA is most commonly detected in the evaluation of symptomatic associated cardiac lesions such as ventricular septal defect (VSD) or pulmonary ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Isolated L-TGA often presents later in life with features of systemic ventricular dysfunction, systemic atrioventricular (AV) valve regurgitation, or heart block.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H151925319\"><span class=\"h3\">Associated cardiac abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Another cardiac lesion is present in most cases of L-TGA (&gt;90 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/l-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. The associated lesion generally determines the signs and symptoms at the time of presentation. The following are the most common cardiac lesions associated with L-TGA, their relative frequency, and usual presenting signs or symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/l-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/1-3,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,14,15</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VSD occurs in 70 to 80 percent of patients with L-TGA. These defects can be found in any region of the ventricular septum; however, the most common form of defect is found in the perimembranous location. A systolic murmur is generally present once the pulmonary vascular resistance sufficiently falls after birth, resulting in left-to-right shunting. In severe cases, signs of heart failure are present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-isolated-ventricular-septal-defects-in-infants-and-children#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and clinical features of isolated ventricular septal defects in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary (ie, left ventricular [LV]) outflow tract obstruction has been reported in 30 to 60 percent of cases and often accompanies a large VSD. The obstruction is commonly subvalvular and is generally due to an aneurysm of the interventricular septum, fibrous tissue tags, or a discrete ring of subvalvular tissue. Less frequently, valvar pulmonary stenosis is the cause of LV outflow tract obstruction. Cyanosis is often a presenting finding in neonates with limited pulmonary blood flow due to major outflow tract obstruction and large VSD because of a significant pulmonary-to-systemic ventricular cardiac shunt.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tricuspid (systemic AV) valve abnormalities are observed at autopsy in up to 90 percent of L-TGA cases. Regurgitation is frequent and generally progressive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/l-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Since this valve is associated with the systemic ventricle, tricuspid valve abnormalities have an important impact in the development of ventricular dysfunction and heart failure in older uncorrected patients. An Ebstein-like malformation of the tricuspid valve, which is usually accompanied by right ventricular (RV) dysfunction and failure, has been reported in 20 to 53 percent of patients with L-TGA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/l-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/3,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,15</a>]. Symptoms related to tricuspid valve abnormalities are dependent on the severity of the defect, and are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebstein-anomaly\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Ebstein anomaly&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mitral valve abnormalities, although less frequent than tricuspid abnormalities, still occur in 55 percent of cases in autopsy series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/l-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These lesions include abnormal number of cusps, straddling chordal attachments of the subvalvar apparatus creating pulmonary outflow tract obstruction, and mitral valve dysplasia. This abnormality may not present with significant clinical findings.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H266446449\"><span class=\"h3\">Isolated L-TGA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Less than 20 percent of L-TGA patients have L-TGA as an isolated disorder, and generally present later in life with signs and symptoms related to either arrhythmias or heart failure.</p><p>Complete heart block is the most common arrhythmia in patients with L-TGA with signs and symptoms of bradycardia, fatigue, and poor exercise tolerance. In L-TGA, the cardiac conduction system is often abnormal and unstable. Although the sinoatrial (SA) node is located in its normal position near the superior vena cava, the AV node is typically located along the anterosuperior margin of the VSD and is usually accompanied by an elongated His-Purkinje conduction system (His bundle); a second subsidiary AV node may also be noted in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/l-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. These abnormalities are associated with progressive fibrosis with advancing age, which increases the risk of complete heart block (progressive incidence of 2 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/l-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]) and reentrant tachyarrhythmias including Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bradycardia-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bradycardia in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebstein-anomaly\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Ebstein anomaly&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Symptoms of heart failure (eg, dyspnea, fatigue, fluid retention, and decreased exercise tolerance) typically occur in adult patients with progressive dysfunction of the morphologic RV and increasing systemic tricuspid regurgitation (see <a href=\"#H77441072\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/l-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In one case series of 182 adult patients, two-thirds of patients with associated lesions and one-quarter of patients without additional cardiac defects had developed heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/l-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

In particular, tricuspid regurgitation is a concomitant risk factor for heart failure and mortality in adult patients because of increased volume load of the morphologic RV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/l-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/1,10,13,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10,13,16</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H17851677\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p>This was best illustrated in a large multicenter case series of 182 adult patients with congenitally corrected TGA. Heart failure was more common in patients with associated cardiac lesions than in those with an isolated lesion (51 versus 34 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/l-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. By the age of 45 years, two-thirds of patients with associated lesions and one-quarter of patients without additional cardiac defects had developed heart failure symptoms. In the overall cohort, the risk of systemic ventricular dysfunction, systemic AV valve regurgitation, and ongoing rhythm disturbances increased with advancing age. Risk factors for heart failure included tricuspid regurgitation, tricuspid valve surgery, significant arrhythmia, history of open heart surgery, and pacemaker therapy.</p><p>In a case series of 44 adults with unoperated congenitally corrected TGA from a single tertiary center, similar findings were noted of an association between systemic AV valve regurgitation and significant right (systemic) ventricular dysfunction in 26 patients (59 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/l-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

This results in the characteristic ECG findings of Q waves in the right precordial leads and an absence of Q waves in the left-sided precordial leads (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F85852\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef85852 \">waveform 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/l-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. These ECG findings may be misinterpreted as an inferior myocardial infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/l-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, patients may also have varying degrees of AV heart block due to abnormalities of the conduction system.

In affected fetuses without other cardiac defects, the four-chamber view could be interpreted as normal due to a lack of ventricular size discrepancy, as is true in fetuses with dextro-transposition of the great arteries (D-TGA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/l-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In both types of TGA, the diagnosis is typically made by an experienced fetal ultrasonographer who correctly observes that the great arteries are parallel in the three-vessel view, and do not cross as is expected in normal cardiac anatomy. However, this finding is usually not appreciated in the routine antenatal ultrasound examination, which generally focuses on a four-chamber view of the heart and not on the anatomy of the great arteries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17851730\"><span class=\"h2\">Postnatal diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of L-TGA is generally made by echocardiography. In most patients (&gt;90 percent), the diagnosis is usually an incidental finding during echocardiography, which is being performed due to signs and symptoms of an associated cardiac lesion, including suspected congenital heart disease based on findings from antenatal ultrasonography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/l-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

In rare patients, bradycardia may be the initial presenting symptom due to conduction system abnormality that prompts further evaluation including an electrocardiogram (ECG). The characteristic findings on the ECG are suggestive of L-TGA and the diagnosis is confirmed by echocardiography.

L-TGA is recognized by identifying the systemic location of the tricuspid valve and morphologic right ventricle. The right ventricle is characterized by coarse trabeculations, which differentiates it from the morphologic left ventricle with its fine trabeculations and smooth septal surface. These ventricular lesions are best seen from short-axis and apical four-chamber views.</p><p>In patients with L-TGA, the great arteries do <strong>not</strong> normally cross and are parallel to one another with the aorta abnormally positioned anterior, superior, and to the left of the pulmonary artery (PA). Subcostal imaging often provides the best views to demonstrate that the posterior, inferior, and rightward PA is associated with the morphologic left ventricle.</p><p>In addition, particular attention should be paid when evaluating the ventricular septum for defects, as patients may have large inlet VSDs or smaller muscular VSDs. Due to the high incidence of abnormalities in the left-sided tricuspid valve, this structure should be evaluated for the apical displacement of the septal leaflet that is seen in Ebstein's malformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/l-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/1,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H266446441\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis in most patients with levo-transposition of the great arteries (L-TGA) is made incidentally during echocardiographic evaluation for antenatal diagnosis of congenital heart disease or symptoms related to other congenital heart defects, primarily ventricular septal defect (VSD) and pulmonary flow obstruction.</p><p>However, in most patients without associated symptomatic cardiac defects, the differential diagnosis includes conditions that present with symptoms suggestive of heart failure or complete heart block. L-TGA is differentiated from these conditions by its characteristic electrographic findings (Q waves in the right precordial leads and an absence of Q waves in the left-sided precordial leads) and confirmation of the diagnosis by echocardiography.

These two approaches (conventional and anatomic repair), including their associated complications and outcomes, are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H17851773\" class=\"local\">'Conventional repair'</a> below and <a href=\"#H17851787\" class=\"local\">'Anatomic repair'</a> below.)</p><p>It is challenging to decide on the optimal surgical approach in patients with L-TGA, as there is a paucity of data and there are no controlled trials comparing anatomic versus conventional repair. Due to the small number of patients with this disease, it is unlikely that any will be performed. The decision to perform anatomic repair that involves more complex surgical interventions including left ventricular retraining is based on the hypothesis that the patients' functional status will be improved as they reach adulthood. As a result, long-term outcomes of anatomic repairs must be better understood particularly regarding quality of life, functional status, and the morbidity that results from atrial and arterial switches (tachyarrhythmias, baffle obstructions, neo-aortic regurgitation, and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H77441461\"><span class=\"h3\">Suggested guide for deciding surgical approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on the currently available evidence for the two different approaches (presented below), we use the following guideline to choose among the different surgical options for patients with L-TGA:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pediatric patients with L-TGA and significant ventricular septal defect [VSD], LV outflow tract obstruction, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> Ebstein-like malformation of the tricuspid valve should be considered for anatomic repair, as they are at greatest risk for developing systemic heart failure with conventional repair.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If a patient requires LV retraining with pulmonary artery (PA) band placement, this should be performed early in childhood. (See <a href=\"#H17851794\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary artery banding or left ventricular &quot;training&quot;'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In pediatric patients without associated lesions that predispose to systemic heart failure, the choice of anatomic repair is controversial. These are complex procedures that require substantial time on cardiopulmonary bypass and incur risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality, while their long-term outcome remains uncertain. In contrast, there are data that show adults with isolated L-TGA without anatomic repair are at risk for systemic heart failure, although the risk is lower than in patients described above with associated lesions that increase the work of the systemic right ventricle (RV).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As a result, based on the currently available data, our approach is to discuss with the family the known benefits and complications of the proposed surgical procedures and the areas of uncertainty. The final decision is individualized based on a review of the patient's potential for heart failure without anatomic correction versus the potential complications of the anatomic repair, and the preference of the family.</p><p/><p>Patients who are diagnosed with L-TGA beyond childhood eventually present with systemic ventricular dysfunction or failure, systemic tricuspid valve regurgitation, or arrhythmias. When systemic tricuspid regurgitation is present, these adults should be referred for systemic atrioventricular (AV) valve replacement before they have morphologic RV failure or progressive dysfunction (systemic RV ejection fraction [EF] less than 40 percent). PA banding has been found to improve systemic AV valve regurgitation in select patients. Cardiac transplantation or ventricular assist device placement should be considered in patients with persistent heart failure refractory to these measures and medical management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17851773\"><span class=\"h2\">Conventional repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conventional repair is focused on repair of the associated lesions that were present with L-TGA. As examples, patients with a VSD would undergo VSD closure and those with LV outflow tract obstruction could undergo a LV to pulmonary artery conduit. Patients with complex straddling of AV valves across the ventricular septum or ventricular hypoplasia would be candidates for interventions of single ventricle palliation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-isolated-ventricular-septal-defects-in-infants-and-children#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of isolated ventricular septal defects in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Surgical repair'</a>.)</p><p>In this approach, surgical replacement of the systemic tricuspid valve is performed in patients with significant tricuspid regurgitation. In a case series of initially unoperated patients (&gt;18 years of age), 30 of 44 patients had subsequent tricuspid valve (systemic AV valve) replacement after developing moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation and ventricular dysfunction over a mean follow-up period of 144 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/l-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Four patients required cardiac transplantation. Preoperative systemic ventricular dysfunction (ie, EF less than 40 percent) predicted poor outcome (death or cardiac transplantation). In a subsequent report from the same center, EF less than 40 percent remained the only independent predictor of poor postoperative ventricular function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/l-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Based on these results, if there is not anatomic correction, close monitoring of systemic ventricular function (morphologic RV) and tricuspid valvar function is required. In these patients, early surgical intervention including tricuspid valve replacement should be performed before systemic ventricular failure develops. Adults with L-TGA and severe systemic tricuspid regurgitation can also be considered for PA banding in an effort to decrease regurgitation and serve as a bridge to transplantation or other surgical interventions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17851780\"><span class=\"h3\">Outcome and complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the early mortality for the conventional surgical approach is low, the long-term outcome is poor because of the progressive systemic RV dysfunction and heart failure. This was demonstrated by the following case series:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a case series from a single center of 123 patients with L-TGA who underwent conventional repair, postoperative survival rates at 1, 5, 10, and 15 years were 84, 75, 68, and 61 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/l-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Risk factors associated with a poorer outcome included tricuspid valve replacement, preoperative poor RV function, complete heart block after surgery, subvalvular pulmonary stenosis, and Ebstein-like malformation of the tricuspid valve.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another case series from a single center of 121 patients treated conventionally, 5-, 10-, and 20-year survival rates were 92, 91, and 75 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/l-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In this cohort, 86 patients underwent surgical intervention. Multivariate analysis showed that complete AV canal defect and poor RV function were risk factors for mortality.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17851787\"><span class=\"h2\">Anatomic repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of associated lesions remains the major determinant regarding surgical repair. However, the poor late outcome results associated with conventional repair of L-TGA have led to an alternative approach of anatomic correction to make the morphologic LV the systemic pump and the morphologic RV the pulmonary ventricle. This generally requires equally sized ventricles, and a morphologic LV that is prepared (ie, sufficiently hypertrophied or &quot;trained&quot;) to take over the workload of the systemic ventricle, thereby minimizing the likelihood of postoperative LV failure.</p><p>Additional LV training is not required in infants who have significant pulmonary stenosis, pulmonary hypertension, or an unrestrictive VSD. In these patients, the LV is already functioning at pressure levels consistent with what will be required as the systemic ventricle. However, in other patients in whom the LV is not initially ready to become the systemic ventricle, PA banding is used to &quot;train&quot; the LV.</p><p>The current choice of surgical intervention for anatomic correction of the ventricles is largely dependent on the presence of subpulmonary obstruction and the anatomy of the VSD:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Double switch (DS) operation is performed in patients without significant subpulmonary obstruction</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Senning-Rastelli procedure is performed in patients with a large VSD and LV outflow tract obstruction</p><p/><p>The individual components of these two procedures (ie, the arterial and atrial switch) have also been used for anatomic correction in patients with dextro-transposition of the great arteries (D-TGA).

This exposure to near systemic pressure increases the LV posterior wall thickness (ie, LV &quot;training&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/l-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. Altering the left and right ventricular pressure ratio may also reduce the RV sphericity and improve the geometry of the right ventricle prior to anatomic correction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/l-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Several case series have shown that PA banding stabilizes systemic AV valve regurgitation and improves systemic ventricular function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/l-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/10,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,26,27</a>].

Patients older than 16 years of age appear to be unlikely to achieve sufficient LV function to proceed to anatomic correction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/l-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Although pediatric cardiac surgical centers use varying measurements to determine if a morphologic LV is adequately prepared for the systemic circulation, most published reports suggest a morphologic LV pressure of 66 to 80 percent of systemic pressure is sufficient. Serial echocardiograms and cardiac catheterizations are recommended to determine that sufficient LV pressure is obtained prior to surgical correction. In addition, others recommend that normal LV mass and thickness for systemic function using echocardiography <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> magnetic resonance imaging be required prior to anatomic correction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/l-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Repeat banding is often required when the PA band has become too &quot;loose&quot; and the goals for LV pressure have not been met. Risk factors for failure of PA band retraining include mild LV dysfunction before banding, development of significant LV dilation and dysfunction, and postoperative development of tricuspid regurgitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/l-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>The reported median time from PA banding to the double switch procedure ranges from 2 to 14.5 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/l-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/25,28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,28-30</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94651460\"><span class=\"h4\">Large ventricular septal defect</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In infants with a large unrestrictive VSD, an increase in pulmonary blood flow may result in heart failure in the first few weeks of life as the pulmonary vascular resistance falls. The placement of a PA band can be considered in patients who are refractory to medical management. Creating increased resistance to the pulmonary circuit will reduce pulmonary blood flow, improve the symptoms of heart failure, and promote weight gain. Promotion of growth is desired as anatomic surgical correction is easier to perform in a larger infant.

The intra-atrial baffle diverts the deoxygenated systemic venous return into the subpulmonary ventricle and oxygenated pulmonary venous return to the subsystemic ventricle. The ASO involves transection of both great arteries, and then translocation of the vessels to the opposite root, similar to the ASO procedure performed for D-TGA requiring coronary artery transfer.</p><p>After a DS procedure, normal concordance is established with systemic deoxygenated blood baffled across the tricuspid valve into the morphologic RV and flow into the PA. In addition, the oxygenated pulmonary venous return is baffled from the left atrium across the mitral valve into the morphologic LV and then pumped across the neo-aorta to the systemic circulation.</p><p>This operation is a technically difficult and challenging procedure with a long cardiopulmonary bypass time. Therefore, identifying the ideal surgical timing is a complex issue. Various centers report a median age at the time of surgery that ranges from 7 months to 3.2 years and a median weight of 9.6 to 14.7 kg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/l-transposition-of-the-great-arteries/abstract/18,25,28,30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,25,28,30-33</a>].

In this intervention, the intra-atrial baffle (Senning tunnel) is created and the VSD is closed by a baffle so that the blood from the LV is directed into the aorta, and a conduit is placed between the RV and PA (Rastelli procedure). The Rastelli procedure requires a sizable and appropriately located VSD so that the baffle can be placed to redirect blood flow into the aorta.

It is also referred to as congenitally corrected TGA, double discordance, or ventricular inversion.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>L-TGA is due to the abnormal left looping of the primitive heart, which results in the morphologic left ventricle (LV) being positioned to the right of the morphologic right ventricle (RV). This results in deoxygenated systemic venous blood returning to the discordant LV via the mitral valve, and into the lung through the discordant transposed pulmonary arteries. Oxygenated blood flows from the lungs through the pulmonary veins through the left atrium into the discordant RV via the tricuspid valve, and returns to the systemic circulation through the discordant aorta. (See <a href=\"#H17851649\" class=\"local\">'Embryology and anatomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In most cases of L-TGA (&gt;90 percent), another cardiac lesion is present, primarily ventricular septal defect (VSD, 70 to 80 percent), and pulmonary ventricular outflow tract obstruction (30 to 60 percent). In general, the clinical manifestations are dependent on the associated cardiac lesion. In the small minority of patients without an associated structural defect, patients will present later in life (usually as adults) with signs and symptoms of complete heart block, arrhythmias, systemic tricuspid valve regurgitation, or systemic RV dysfunction with ultimate heart failure. (See <a href=\"#H17851684\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory findings of tests performed during the evaluation of associated cardiac lesions include characteristic electrocardiographic (ECG) findings of Q waves in the right precordial leads and an absence of Q waves in the left-sided precordial leads in 25 percent of patients. The chest radiograph may demonstrate features of mesocardia or dextrocardia. (See <a href=\"#H14906203\" class=\"local\">'Tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of L-TGA is made by echocardiography, which demonstrates the inversion of the ventricles and the abnormal placement and parallel course of the great arteries. In most patients, the diagnosis is made as an incidental finding in a postnatal echocardiography, which is performed to evaluate for symptoms of the associated cardiac lesion. (See <a href=\"#H17851714\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with L-TGA are at risk for heart failure due to progressive dysfunction of the morphologic systemic RV and systemic tricuspid valve regurgitation. The risk of heart failure is greater in patients with L-TGA and associated cardiac lesions (eg, VSDs, pulmonary outflow tract, and tricuspid regurgitation) versus those with isolated L-TGA. (See <a href=\"#H77441072\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients without associated symptomatic cardiac defects, the differential diagnosis includes conditions that present with symptoms suggestive of heart failure or complete heart block. L-TGA is distinguished from these conditions by its characteristic ECG features and diagnostic echocardiographic findings. (See <a href=\"#H266446441\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical management in children has shifted from conventional repair of the associated lesions and maintenance of the AV and ventriculoarterial discordance to anatomic repair, which makes the morphologic LV the systemic pump and the morphologic RV the pulmonary ventricle. This change in management approach is based on the less than optimal long-term outcome after conventional repair due to subsequent RV failure, and the premise that long-term survival and morbidity would be improved with anatomic repair. However, there is a paucity of long-term data on the outcome of anatomic repair, especially regarding systemic ventricular function. (See <a href=\"#H17851758\" class=\"local\">'Surgical management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Based on the current data, we suggest anatomic repair for pediatric patients with L-TGA and associated lesions (VSD and pulmonary outflow tract obstruction) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients with isolated L-TGA, anatomic repair is controversial and, in these patients, we suggest that the choice of anatomic repair versus medical management be individualized and include the preference of the family (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The two procedures for anatomic repair are the double switch operation and the Senning-Rastelli procedure. The choice between the two is dependent on the presence of a large VSD and subpulmonary obstruction. (See <a href=\"#H17851787\" class=\"local\">'Anatomic repair'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Longitudinal follow-up care is required in all patients with L-TGA by a cardiologist with expertise in congenital heart disease. Follow-up care includes a focused history and physical examination to detect signs and symptoms suggestive of systemic ventricular dysfunction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> heart block, and annual routine testing including electrocardiography and imaging by echocardiography. (See <a href=\"#H17851857\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Successful pregnancy can be achieved in women with L-TGA, but careful pre-pregnancy evaluation is required. In general, women with a systemic ventricular ejection fraction that is less than 40 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> who have a New York Heart functional class III or IV (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63748\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63748 \">figure 2</a>) should be counseled against pregnancy as the added volume load of pregnancy is typically not well tolerated.
