Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are an alternative to ACE inhibitors in patients who cannot tolerate these drugs.

A review of the clinical data supporting the use of ACE inhibitors in patients with HF and the initial clinical data on the ARBs are discussed separately.

The observation that other vasodilators do not improve survival (or do so to a lesser degree than ACE inhibitors) or may actually worsen cardiac function <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> clinical outcomes has led to the conclusion that ACE inhibitors work by a mechanism other than simply decreasing preload and afterload, or that detrimental effects due to vasodilation per se (eg, renin-angiotensin aldosterone system or sympathetic activation) are countered by other actions of the ACE inhibitors.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Actions of angiotensin II on the heart&quot;</a>.) The reduction in AT1 receptor density paralleled the reduction in the density of &szlig;1 receptors.</p><p>Increased local activity of angiotensin II may be due in part to enhanced ACE activity within the myocardium. An increase in ACE binding sites has been identified in the ventricular myocardium of patients with end-stage HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-heart-failure-mechanisms-of-action/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This was localized to both endothelial cells and myocytes in a pattern similar to the AT1 receptors.</p><p>One possibility is that ACE inhibitors moderate myocyte responses to an excessively activated <strong>intracardiac</strong> renin-angiotensin system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-heart-failure-mechanisms-of-action/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Actions of angiotensin II on the heart&quot;</a>.) This system may contribute to myocardial hypertrophy and remodeling, which may be deleterious in the long-term to ventricular function.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-neurohumoral-adaptations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of heart failure: Neurohumoral adaptations&quot;</a>.) Increased sympathetic tone causes desensitization of beta-adrenergic responsiveness, leading to blunted increases in heart rate and contractility with exercise. In addition, increased sympathetic activity in the myocardium may exert direct detrimental effects due to the stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors by norepinephrine. These include myocyte apoptosis, regression to fetal protein isoforms that compromise contractile function, and alterations in the interstitial matrix.</p><p>ACE inhibitors may reduce sympathetic activity. Patients with symptomatic left ventricular dysfunction have a reduced heart rate response to exercise testing because of elevated baseline sympathetic stimulation and decreased adrenergic sensitivity. Chronic therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enalapril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enalapril</a> reduces norepinephrine levels in these patients and reverses the blunted heart rate response to exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-heart-failure-mechanisms-of-action/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. These effects may be mediated by a reduction in central sympathetic outflow and enhancement of sympathoinhibitory responses to baroreceptor stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-heart-failure-mechanisms-of-action/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Increase in kinins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ACE is also a kininase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-heart-failure-mechanisms-of-action/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], and therefore ACE inhibition also increases the concentration of kinins, most importantly, bradykinin. Bradykinin leads to vasodilation via the release of endothelial nitric oxide, and in addition may exert direct beneficial effects on cardiac myocytes. The vasodilator response to kinins appears to be preserved in HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-heart-failure-mechanisms-of-action/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>These kinin-dependent benefits would not be seen with the angiotensin receptor antagonists, which do not affect kinin synthesis. However, the clinical benefits of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists do not appear to differ substantially.

ACE inhibitors improve endothelial function, perhaps via increased bradykinin-induced release of nitric oxide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-heart-failure-mechanisms-of-action/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], normalization of nitric oxide synthase expression, reduced degradation of nitric oxide by oxidative stress, or abolition of the release <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the effect of vasoconstrictor prostanoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-heart-failure-mechanisms-of-action/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. ACE inhibitors also inhibit the release of endothelin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-heart-failure-mechanisms-of-action/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Although ACE inhibitors have a beneficial effect in HF, it is uncertain if they alter the levels of these cytokines. This was addressed by one study of 75 patients with New York Heart Association class II to IV HF who were randomized to low- (5 mg daily) or high-dose (40 mg daily) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enalapril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enalapril</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-heart-failure-mechanisms-of-action/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. There was a significant reduction in immunoreactive interleukin-6 levels with high-, but not low-, dose enalapril, which was associated with a decrease in the thickness of the interventricular septum.

Increases in plasma viscosity and fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, and soluble P-selectin, which are directly related to the severity of HF, may contribute to the prothrombotic state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-heart-failure-mechanisms-of-action/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In one report, an ACE inhibitor, but not a beta blocker, reduced the concentrations of fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-heart-failure-mechanisms-of-action/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect on plasma fibrinolytic activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Angiotensin II can influence plasma fibrinolytic properties by inducing the release of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1; in contrast, bradykinin causes the release of t-PA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-heart-failure-mechanisms-of-action/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The use of ACE inhibitors after a myocardial infarction decreases PAI-1 concentrations, which may contribute to their beneficial effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-heart-failure-mechanisms-of-action/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The improvement in fibrinolytic factors may also play a role in patients with HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-heart-failure-mechanisms-of-action/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This effect may be more pronounced with the angiotensin II receptor blocker <a href=\"topic.htm?path=losartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">losartan</a> than with ACE inhibition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-heart-failure-mechanisms-of-action/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

The major site of conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II and for the inactivation of circulating bradykinin is the lung, where angiotensin converting enzyme is highly concentrated in the luminal surface of the pulmonary blood vessels. One study evaluated the effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enalapril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enalapril</a> on pulmonary function in patients with and without HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-heart-failure-mechanisms-of-action/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. ACE inhibition, but not hydralazine-isosorbide dinitrate, increased alveolar-capillary membrane diffusing capacity and pulmonary function in patients with HF but not in those without HF. The effect of enalapril was counteracted by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, suggesting that the benefit was in part mediated by prostaglandins.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Effects in diastolic dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ACE inhibitors have not been as widely used in HF with preserved ejection fraction due in part to concerns that vasodilatation might lead to hypotension, and lack of clinical trial data showing an improvement in outcomes. In patients with hypertensive heart disease, however, the reduction in systemic pressure can lead to regression of left ventricular hypertrophy and a gradual improvement in diastolic function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-heart-failure-mechanisms-of-action/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An additional potential benefit is that reducing myocardial angiotensin II production may diminish myocardial stiffness. Evidence in support of this hypothesis has been provided by a study of patients with diastolic dysfunction due to aortic stenosis-induced left ventricular hypertrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-heart-failure-mechanisms-of-action/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The intracoronary infusion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enalaprilat-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enalaprilat</a>, which produced no evidence of systemic ACE inhibition but presumably impaired cardiac angiotensin II production, improved diastolic distensibility and relaxation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect on right ventricular function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction often have abnormal right ventricular function with elevated right heart pressures and tricuspid regurgitation. This effect is most prominent when there is a restrictive pattern to left ventricular filling. In some patients, therapy with an ACE inhibitor can normalize right ventricular filling in association with regression of the left ventricular restrictive pattern and improvement in diastolic function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-heart-failure-mechanisms-of-action/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The benefit of ACE inhibition is not due to a direct effect on right ventricular relaxation or a fall in pulmonary artery pressure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect on exercise capacity and skeletal muscle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HF is characterized by a reduction in exercise capacity because of the early appearance of fatigue and dyspnea. The origin of these symptoms is uncertain and may reflect acquired abnormalities in skeletal muscle. Therapy with ACE inhibitors significantly improves exercise capacity in patients with HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-heart-failure-mechanisms-of-action/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. It does not appear that the ACE inhibitors alter muscle metabolism. As an example, one study obtained muscle biopsies from patients with HF prior to and after therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enalapril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enalapril</a> and compared them to those obtained from normals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-heart-failure-mechanisms-of-action/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Enalapril had no effect on skeletal muscle metabolism or on the number of capillaries per muscle fiber, both of which were reduced in HF. There was an increase in muscle fiber area but this was probably due to increased physical activity.</p><p>In another study, treatment with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enalapril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enalapril</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=losartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">losartan</a> for six months improved exercise capacity in association with a shift in leg muscle contractile protein composition toward more fatigue-resistant fibers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-heart-failure-mechanisms-of-action/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The preponderance of data suggest that improvements in exercise capacity and muscle function with ACE inhibition are due to improvement in cardiac <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> circulatory function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skeletal-muscle-dysfunction-and-exercise-intolerance-in-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skeletal muscle dysfunction and exercise intolerance in heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect on arterial compliance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HF is characterized by a reduction in the compliance or distensibility of large elastic and middle-sized muscular arteries; this effect is directly related to the severity of HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-heart-failure-mechanisms-of-action/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Decreased arterial compliance results in the following changes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increase in arterial impedance and cardiac afterload</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A reduction in diastolic pressure and perfusion of organs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An acceleration of atherosclerosis due to an increase in systolic and diastolic pulse pressure and a greater traumatic effect on vessel walls.</p><p/><p>These changes can be reversed by interference with the renin-angiotensin system using high doses of ACE inhibitors or by the combination of an ACE inhibitor and an angiotensin II receptor blocker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-heart-failure-mechanisms-of-action/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Rather than inhibiting the production of angiotensin II, they block the binding of angiotensin II to the AT1 receptor. One important consequence of this difference is that the angiotensin II receptor antagonists do not affect kinin metabolism and therefore do not appear to induce cough, an infrequent complication with ACE inhibitors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renin-angiotensin-system-inhibition-in-the-treatment-of-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renin-angiotensin system inhibition in the treatment of hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Increasing evidence suggests that ARBs share the same clinical spectrum as ACE inhibitors in a variety of settings such as hypertension, HF, and chronic renal failure. However, there are differences between these two classes of drugs. In addition to the differential effect of kinins, inhibition of angiotensin II formation with an ACE inhibitor will diminish the activity of both the AT1 and AT2 receptors, whereas the ARBs only diminish AT1 activity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Reduced sympathetic activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with ACE inhibitors, ARBs reduce the sympathetic activation seen in heart failure. This was illustrated by data from 4284 subjects participating in the Val-HeFT trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-heart-failure-mechanisms-of-action/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Over two years, subjects treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valsartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valsartan</a> had a smaller rise in serum NE than those treated with placebo (12 versus 41 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL)</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect on remodeling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ARBs appear to prevent remodeling after a myocardial infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-heart-failure-mechanisms-of-action/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Combined therapy may be more effective than either class alone.

This was seen in one study of 23 patients randomized to therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=candesartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">candesartan</a> or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-heart-failure-mechanisms-of-action/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. After 14 weeks, candesartan reduced the plasma levels of immune factors, including tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-6, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Combined therapy with ACE inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alternative enzymatic pathways exist for the local production of angiotensin II within the myocardium. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=actions-of-angiotensin-ii-on-the-heart#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Actions of angiotensin II on the heart&quot;, section on 'Cardiac renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system'</a>.) Increased activity of these local myocardial pathways in heart failure (eg, myocardial chymase) may bypass the effects of ACE inhibitors. It is therefore possible that combined treatment with an ACE inhibitor and an ARB may block or counteract in an additive manner to decrease the influence of angiotensin II. The ACE inhibitor-induced reduction in plasma angiotensin II offsets the ARB-induced rise in angiotensin II levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-heart-failure-mechanisms-of-action/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>The combination of an ACE inhibitor and an ARB may have additive effects on left ventricular function, hemodynamics, arterial compliance, and cardiac afterload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-heart-failure-mechanisms-of-action/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].
