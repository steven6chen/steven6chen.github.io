Although most patients present with joint pain and functional limitations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], the age of disease onset, sequence of joint involvement, and disease progression varies from person to person. OA ranges from an asymptomatic, incidental finding on clinical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiographic examination to a rapidly progressive disabling disorder eventually culminating in &quot;joint failure.&quot;</p><p>The clinical features and approach to the diagnosis of OA will be reviewed here. The pathogenesis, epidemiology, and treatment of OA are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-osteoarthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of osteoarthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for and possible causes of osteoarthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4216048149\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary symptoms of osteoarthritis (OA) are joint pain, stiffness, and locomotor restriction. Symptoms usually present in just one or a few joints in a middle-aged or older person. Other manifestations in patients with OA include sequelae such as muscle weakness and poor balance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] and comorbidities like fibromyalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2245220337\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms and signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following symptoms and signs may be observed in patients with OA:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pain </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Pain in OA is worse with joint use (usage-related pain) and relieved by rest. It is often the most frequent symptom and generally progresses through three stages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Stage 1 &ndash; Predictable, sharp pain usually brought on by a mechanical insult that eventually limits high-impact activities with relatively modest effect on function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Stage 2 &ndash; Pain becomes more constant and starts to affect daily activities. There may be unpredictable episodes of stiffness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Stage 3 &ndash; Constant <span class=\"nowrap\">dull/aching</span> pain punctuated by episodes of often unpredictable, intense, exhausting pain which results in severe limitations in function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, not all patients go through such distinct stages, and pain progression may be arrested at any stage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Pain is generally worse in the late afternoon and early evening but can also be worse in the morning soon after waking up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. There may also be night pain in severe OA which can interfere with sleep. In some people, the pain has a burning (neuropathic) quality, is widespread around the joint, and is associated with paresthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]; such features also suggest comorbid fibromyalgia. Painful periarticular soft-tissue lesions may coexist, especially with large-joint OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] &#160; Periarticular soft-tissue lesions cause localized pain away from the joint line, whereas OA-related pain more commonly is most severe over the joint line, except for proximal joints like the hip or the shoulder that may have the maximal pain distal to the originating joint.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tenderness </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Joint-line tenderness suggests articular pathology, while tenderness away from the joint line suggests periarticular soft-tissue pathology.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Limitation of motion </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Reduced range of motion<strong> </strong>(equal for both active and passive movement) mainly results from marginal osteophytes and capsular thickening, but synovial hyperplasia and effusion may also contribute.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bony swelling</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Bony swelling reflects remodeling of the bone and cartilage on either side of the joint and marginal osteophytes and may be evident in small (eg, finger interphalangeal, first metatarsophalangeal [MTP]) and large (eg, knee) joints.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Joint deformity</strong> &ndash; Deformity is a sign of advanced joint damage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Instability</strong> &ndash; Giving way or buckling is a common symptom in knee OA. Occasionally people may stumble and fall, but usually it is a feeling of apprehension and lack of confidence to weight-bear rather than literally &quot;giving way.&quot;&nbsp;It is predominantly a sign of muscle weakness with subsequent altered patellar tracking (with lateral patellar subluxation) but may also associate with true joint instability.&nbsp;Similar symptoms are frequently reported by patients with thumb-base OA.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1569543261\"><span class=\"h2\">Joint distribution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many of the characteristic clinical manifestations of OA are related to the involvement of particular joints. OA can be categorized into localized or generalized forms of the disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1185403560\"><span class=\"h3\">Single- or multiple-joint osteoarthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OA has a predilection for the knees, hips, interphalangeal joints, first carpometacarpal (CMC) joints, first MTP joints and apophyseal (facet) joints of the lower cervical and lower lumbar spine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F105815\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105815 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>OA less commonly affects the elbow, wrist, shoulder (ie, the glenohumeral joint), and ankle. When the elbow, shoulder (especially the acromioclavicular joint), and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints (eg, the &quot;Missouri metacarpal syndrome&quot;) are affected, occupations that involve overuse of the upper limbs should be suspected. The symptoms at these joints are similar to those of OA at other joints (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F108692\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108692 \">table 1</a>); however, joint involvement is more often unilateral.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3603739713\"><span class=\"h3\">Generalized osteoarthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Generalized OA implies a polyarticular subset of OA typically involving the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints, thumb bases (first CMC joints and trapezioscaphoid joints) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51990\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51990 \">figure 2</a>), first MTP joints, lower cervical and lumbar facet joints, knees, and hips [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. It is characterized by slow accumulation of multiple joint involvement over several years. Symptoms usually commence in the hands around middle age and subsequently affect the knees and other joints over the next few decades. The clinical marker for generalized OA is the presence of multiple Heberden's nodes, which are posterolateral hard swellings of the DIP joints (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F105816\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105816 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Heberden's nodes are often accompanied by less well-defined posterolateral swellings of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints referred to as Bouchard's nodes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F105817\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105817 \">picture 2</a>). Generalized OA may occur in the absence of nodes, so called non-nodal generalized OA, which is more common in men (compared with nodal generalized OA, which is more common in women) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. There is no universal definition for the number of joints affected before someone can be classified as having generalized OA, but guidance from the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League of Rheumatology (EULAR) suggests that generalized OA is present if there is OA at the spinal or hand joints, respectively, and in at least two other joint regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3222307137\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of OA is a clinical one based on characteristic signs and symptoms described above. When the diagnosis is unclear or important alternative diagnoses need to be considered, several imaging modalities can be used to assess the presence and severity of OA. Our approach to imaging for OA is generally consistent with guidelines developed by professional organizations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Radiography </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Conventional radiography is the most widely used imaging modality in OA and allows for detection of characteristic features of OA including marginal osteophytes, joint space narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, and cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Radiographs can also be used to measure joint space narrowing, which is sometimes used as a surrogate measure of cartilage loss. However, radiographic changes in OA are insensitive, particularly with early disease, and often correlate poorly with symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. Also, radiographic OA is a common incidental finding in older people.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Magnetic resonance imaging </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not necessary for most patients with symptoms suggestive of OA <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> typical radiographic features. However, MRI can identify OA at earlier stages of disease before radiographic changes become apparent. These changes include cartilage defects and bone marrow lesions. MRI can also be used to assess pathology in other structures of the joint not visualized by radiography such as effusions, synovium, and ligaments.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ultrasonography </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Ultrasonography is another imaging modality that can identify OA-associated structural changes and is useful for detecting synovial inflammation, effusion, and osteophytosis. Limitations of ultrasound include that it is operator-dependent and cannot be used to assess deeper articular structures and subchondral bone.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2655097148\"><span class=\"h2\">Synovial fluid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Synovial fluid from OA joints is usually noninflammatory or mildly inflammatory with less than 2000 white blood <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup>,</span> predominantly mononuclear cells. Inflammatory effusion in OA may occur in the presence of calcium pyrophosphate crystals (see <a href=\"#H1494224415\" class=\"local\">'Osteoarthritis with calcium pyrophosphate deposition'</a> below). A detailed discussion on synovial fluid analysis is presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=synovial-fluid-analysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Synovial fluid analysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1494224415\"><span class=\"h2\">Osteoarthritis with calcium pyrophosphate deposition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Calcium pyrophosphate crystals may be present in as many as 30 to 60 percent of unselected OA patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Most patients with OA and calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) are older than 60 years, and common target sites are the knees, radiocarpal joints, second and third MCP joints, shoulder, and elbow joints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. The presence of CPPD may modify OA symptoms at that site, especially with longer early morning stiffness and more signs of synovitis. The symptoms may be acute with marked pain, swelling, and tenderness, at its worst within 6 to 24 hours, typically lasting from a few days to one to two weeks; intermittent; or low-grade and persistent (chronic inflammatory CPPD disease). Joint swelling, warmth, and tenderness may be more common and more pronounced than in OA without CPPD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F105825\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105825 \">picture 3</a>). Joint effusions are common and may be hemorrhagic or turbid on aspiration. Large joint effusions may leak into the surrounding soft tissues and lead to localized pain, swelling, and extensive bruising, especially at the shoulder and knee. Symptoms are mostly restricted to one or a few joints at a time, but polyarticular involvement can occur, especially involving knees, wrists, and MCP joints, that superficially may mimic RA.</p><p>Although studies give conflicting results, it is likely that OA with CPPD is not any more rapidly progressive than OA alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>], and patients with end-stage knee OA with CPPD do not have any more difficulty with activities than those with end-stage knee OA alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, a few patients with CPPD do appear to develop rapidly progressive destructive arthropathy at knees, shoulders, or hips. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease&quot;, section on 'Osteoarthritis with CPPD'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1471486676\"><span class=\"h1\">CHARACTERISTICS OF SPECIFIC JOINT INVOLVEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many of the characteristic clinical manifestations of osteoarthritis (OA) are related to the involvement of particular joints. As described above, OA has a predilection for the hand, knee, hip, and spine, and less commonly affects the shoulder, elbow, wrist, and ankle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2621641913\"><span class=\"h2\">Hand</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms are usually bilateral, and joint involvement is usually approximately symmetrical [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/15,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,28</a>]. Typical symptoms affect just one or a few joints at a time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Symptoms can be intermittent and target characteristic sites, ie, distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints, thumb bases, proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints, and second and third metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints, in descending order of frequency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Individuals without pain may still report an &quot;aching&quot; or stiffness in the hands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Symptoms may worsen in approximately half of patients over the next six years, and the predictors of adverse clinical outcomes include a high level of baseline functional impairment and a greater number of painful joints, with no correlation between clinical symptoms and radiographic progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18520431\"><span class=\"h3\">Nodal osteoarthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heberden's <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> Bouchard's nodes plus underlying interphalangeal OA constitute nodal OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Affected people are frequently women, often with a remarkable familial predisposition. Symptoms usually start in middle age, typically around menopause, with a stuttering onset of pain, tenderness, and stiffness of one or a few finger interphalangeal joints. At the start, there may be intermittent warmth and soft-tissue swelling, but over a period of a few years the involved interphalangeal joints usually become less painful, and signs of inflammation subside, leaving behind firm-hard bony swellings on the posterolateral aspect of the interphalangeal joints, termed Heberden's and Bouchard's nodes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F105816\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105816 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F105817\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105817 \">picture 2</a>). Heberden's nodes sometimes coalesce to form a single dorsal bar (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F105816\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105816 \">picture 1</a>). Over a period of several years, new interphalangeal joints go through the same process in a &quot;mono-arthritis multiplex&quot; fashion. In addition to nodes, affected interphalangeal joints may show restriction in movement and lateral deviation (radial or ulnar, with most deviations pointing towards the middle finger). Lateral deviation of interphalangeal joints, without instability, is a characteristic feature of nodal OA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F105817\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105817 \">picture 2</a>). Nodes most frequently occur at the index and middle fingers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Fully evolved nodes usually are not painful but may be a cosmetic problem.</p><p>Thumb-base OA generally affects older postmenopausal women. Individuals with thumb-base OA (OA of the first carpometacarpal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> scaphotrapeziotrapezoid [STT] joint) have localized deep thenar, radial wrist, or thumb-base pain, exacerbated on joint use. There may also be distal radiation into the thumb and, to a lesser extent, proximally. Activities that involve pinching (opposition of the thumb to a finger) are generally most painful. A subjective grinding sensation on movement may be present. There may be radial subluxation and adduction at the thumb base, giving it a swollen &quot;squared&quot; appearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F105818\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105818 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/15,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,28</a>]. Localized tenderness may be present and passive thumb circumduction may be painful. Unlike interphalangeal joint OA, thumb-base OA sometimes associates with persistent symptoms and functional impairment (occasionally requiring surgery). Thumb-base OA may also occur on its own without nodal interphalangeal OA.</p><p>At the MCP joints, OA mainly targets the second and third MCP joints, most often causing bony enlargement without signs of synovitis. As described above, relatively isolated MCP joint OA sometimes occurs in older men who have had physically demanding occupations (&quot;Missouri metacarpal syndrome&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1185403560\" class=\"local\">'Single- or multiple-joint osteoarthritis'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2590101168\"><span class=\"h3\">Erosive osteoarthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Erosive OA is an uncommon and particularly aggressive subset of hand OA. It presents with a subacute or insidious onset of pain, stiffness, soft-tissue swelling, and sometimes paresthesiae affecting multiple interphalangeal joints (ie, synchronous polyarticular onset) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/15,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,31</a>]. Compared with nodal hand OA, pain, tenderness, and inflammation (warmth, soft-tissue swelling, sometimes erythema) are more marked and prolonged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>], and erosive OA is not associated with generalized OA (OA). Erosive OA targets just interphalangeal joints (the DIP joints more frequently than PIP joints) and usually spares the thumb bases and MCP joints (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F105819\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105819 \">picture 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/15,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,32</a>]. Lateral instability at the interphalangeal joints is an occasional but characteristic finding (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F107133\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef107133 \">picture 6</a>), and spontaneous interphalangeal joint fusion may also occur (joint fusion is not a feature of OA). Rarely, there may be an opera glass deformity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], and Heberden's <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> Bouchard's nodes may coexist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Erosive OA has worse outcome in terms of symptom persistence and functional impairment than non-erosive hand OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Although erosive OA as a clinical entity is rare, radiographic subchondral erosions are present in one or a few joints in up to 8.5 percent of patients with symptomatic hand OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1619947871\"><span class=\"h2\">Knee</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The knee is an important target site for OA and worldwide is the commonest single cause of lower-limb disability in adults over age 50. Knee OA is usually bilateral, although one side may be more severely affected. The patellofemoral joint <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the medial tibiofemoral joint are most commonly affected, and isolated lateral tibiofemoral joint OA is relatively rare.</p><p>Pain location may indicate the affected knee compartment. Pain may be anteromedial or more generalized on the medial side in medial-compartment tibiofemoral joint OA or anterior in patellofemoral joint OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Pain from patellofemoral joint OA is exacerbated by prolonged sitting, standing up from a low chair, and climbing stairs or inclines (coming down often being more painful than going up). More widespread anterior knee pain with distal radiation suggests moderate to severe knee OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], and persistent pain at night that interrupts sleep or rest occurs in advanced OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Knee OA usually does not cause posterior knee pain unless there is a complicating popliteal (Baker's) cyst. The patients also report a feeling of &quot;giving way&quot; (especially with patellofemoral joint OA <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> quadriceps weakness) and instability, both of which can associate with falls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Examination reveals typical findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F108692\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108692 \">table 1</a>), and possibly deformities (eg, fixed flexion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> varus, less commonly valgus), quadriceps weakness and wasting, and hip abductor and other muscle weakness may be present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F105821\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105821 \">picture 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>]. Knee effusion is common, though usually mild or modest, and increases in prevalence with the severity of knee OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1959059637\"><span class=\"h2\">Hip</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hip OA presents with pain, aching, stiffness, and restricted movement. Pain due to hip OA is usually felt deep in the anterior groin but may involve the anteromedial or upper lateral thigh and occasionally the buttocks. Distal radiation is not uncommon, and some individuals present with distal thigh <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> knee pain without any proximal symptoms. However, unlike pain originating from the knee, such hip-referred pain is usually more generalized and may be improved by rubbing. Pain is exacerbated particularly by rising from a seated position and during the initial phases of ambulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Unlike knee OA, hip OA is frequently unilateral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Both active and passive hip movements are equally painful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Internal rotation with the hip flexed is frequently the earliest, and most affected movement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F105824\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105824 \">picture 8</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The typical end-stage deformity of hip OA is external rotation, adduction, and fixed flexion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F105823\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105823 \">picture 9</a>). Wasting of thigh muscles, a positive Trendelenburg test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67453\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67453 \">figure 3</a>), and shortening of the affected extremity may also be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>In some patients, especially older adult women, hip OA can be rapidly progressive, with a subacute onset of joint pain which progresses to joint destruction and instability in just a few months. Such rapidly progressive destructive arthropathy has been associated with basic calcium phosphate (mainly hydroxyapatite) crystals and is termed apatite associated destructive arthropathy (ADA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>].<strong> </strong>Shoulders (&quot;Milwaukee shoulder&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>] and knees are other target sites. Muscle wasting, deformities, and moderate to large joint effusions with &quot;noninflammatory&quot; (viscous, occasionally hemorrhagic, low cell count) synovial fluid are common in rapidly progressive large-joint OA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1711767103\"><span class=\"h2\">Facet joint</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Facet joint OA usually coexists with intervertebral disc degeneration, often loosely termed &quot;spondylosis.&quot; It is difficult to isolate symptoms specifically to facet joint OA. However, lumbar facet joint OA leads to localized lumbar pain, which may radiate unilaterally or bilaterally to the buttocks, groin, and thighs, typically ending above the knees [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Symptoms are worse in the morning and during periods of activity and are increased by stress, exercise, lumbar spine extension, rotary motions, and when standing or sitting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Similarly, cervical facet joint OA may present with ipsilateral neck pain, which does not radiate beyond the shoulder and is aggravated by neck rotation or lateral flexion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

Bony enlargement of the first MTP joint is a common finding. Hallux valgus deformity (when the distal end of big toe points towards the midline of the foot), hallux rigidus (or restricted flexion, and extension at the first MTP joint), and cross-over toes are common deformities. Bony enlargement at the first MTP joint and hallux valgus frequently lead to the development of a complicating bursa with additional fibrous tissue reaction on the medial aspect of the first MTP joint (&quot;bunion&quot;). This may get inflamed, for example by rubbing against any footwear.</p><p>Apart from the first MTP joint, OA also commonly targets the talonavicular joint in the midfoot (aggravated by pes planus) and also the subtalar and tibiotalar joints in the hindfoot.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H481425502\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis for osteoarthritis depends largely on the location of the affected site as well as the presence of absence of additional systemic symptoms. We present several alternative diagnoses that may be considered in the appropriate clinical context. However, most disorders can usually be easily distinguished from osteoarthritis (OA). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rheumatoid arthritis</strong> &ndash; OA in the middle-aged or older adult patient is most commonly confused with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) when it involves the hand joints. However, the different patterns of clinical involvement will usually lead to the correct diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F57005\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57005 \">table 2</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>). The following are examples:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nodal OA of the hands typically affects the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints and is frequently associated with the highly characteristic Heberden's nodes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F105816\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105816 \">picture 1</a>). By contrast, RA typically affects the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints, and Heberden's nodes are absent. The carpometacarpal (CMC) joint of the thumb is typically involved in OA, rather than the PIP joint in RA. Swelling of the joints is hard and bony in OA; by comparison, soft, warm, and tender joint swelling is typical of RA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Stiffness of the joint is a very common feature of RA, but it is a relatively rare feature of OA. Furthermore, the stiffness of RA is characteristically worse after resting the joint (eg, morning stiffness), while the stiffness of OA (if present) is typically worse after any effort and is often described as evening stiffness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>OA is characterized radiographically by narrowing of the joint space due to cartilage loss and osteophytes due to bone remodeling, but not periarticular erosions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F55802\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef55802 \">image 1</a>). Sea-gull (central subchondral) erosions are present in joints with erosive OA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F109003\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef109003 \">image 2</a>) &#160; However, many patients with longstanding RA may develop secondary OA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>OA is classically associated with the absence of rheumatoid factor (RF) and antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP). OA is associated with normal levels of acute phase reactants. However, RF may be present, usually in low titer, consistent with the patient's (older) age. In addition, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration may be somewhat elevated, usually secondary to an associated disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Psoriatic arthritis</strong> &ndash; Psoriatic arthritis targets the DIP joints of the hands, which can be observed in hand OA. However, unlike hand OA, psoriatic arthritis may target just one finger, often as dactylitis, and characteristic nail changes are usually present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Crystalline arthritis </strong>&ndash; Crystalline arthritis (gout and pseudogout) can become chronic and even assume a polyarticular distribution involving the fingers (tophaceous gout), wrists, knees, and other large joints. The diagnosis is established by the finding of urate or calcium pyrophosphate crystals, respectively, in synovial fluids. The presence of tophi on physical examination, and the characteristic appearance of punched out juxta-articular gouty erosions are also useful in distinguishing OA from gout (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F109001\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef109001 \">image 3</a>). Calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease can be diagnosed if there is radiographic articular chondrocalcinosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F109002\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef109002 \">image 4</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gout&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hemochromatosis</strong> &ndash; The arthropathy of iron overload may be confused with hand OA. However, unlike hand OA, hemochromatosis targets the MCP joints and wrists, and it predominates in men. The characteristic radiologic findings of hemochromatosis are squared-off bone ends and hook-like osteophytes in the MCP joints, particularly of the second and third MCP joints (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F78740\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef78740 \">image 5</a>). Chondrocalcinosis may also be present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arthritis-and-bone-disease-associated-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arthritis and bone disease associated with hereditary hemochromatosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Infectious arthritis</strong> &ndash; OA of a single joint is usually associated with mild symptoms and a noninflammatory synovial fluid (white blood cell count &lt;2000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup>)</span> but can also present as an acutely painful synovitis that may mimic infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The diagnosis of infectious arthritis is established by culturing the pathogen from the synovial fluid or from the blood. Patients with septic arthritis may or may not appear toxic on examination, depending upon the stage of their infection, the presence of medications that can mask infection (eg, glucocorticoids), and other clinical variables. Peripheral blood leukocytosis with a left shift is common but not invariably present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=septic-arthritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Septic arthritis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other soft-tissue abnormalities</strong> &ndash; Other soft-tissue abnormalities around a single joint may mimic OA. As an example, pain from hip OA must be distinguished from labral impingement <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tear, avascular necrosis of the femoral head, and developmental hip dysplasia (anterior groin pain); greater trochanter pain syndrome (trochanteric bursitis or tendinitis, enthesitis of gluteus medius, lateral thigh pain); and lumbar radiculopathy, sacroiliac joint dysfunction, and hip extensor or rotator muscle strain (posterior pelvic pain) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

In patients with hand arthralgias and a mix of inflammatory and mechanical joint symptoms, rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies may be checked to evaluate for possible of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Radiographic examination may be used to support a diagnosis of OA but is not a routine test to consider as a means to explain clinical symptoms. Patients with a robust diagnosis of OA on clinical grounds may have normal plain radiographs, and vice versa. Also, knee pain on most days of a month can precede radiographic changes of OA by several years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Radiographic examination may have a role in defining the prognosis of patients with symptomatic OA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. However, patients should be examined carefully to exclude any other cause of joint pain, such as periarticular soft-tissue lesions (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-soft-tissue-rheumatic-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of soft tissue rheumatic disorders&quot;</a>). When then there is still diagnostic uncertainty regarding the cause of joint pain, advanced imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or ultrasonography may also be helpful. (See <a href=\"#H3222307137\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p>Synovial fluid examination is not routinely required to support a diagnosis of OA.
