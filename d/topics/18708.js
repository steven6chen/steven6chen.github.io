This disease is still endemic in major parts of the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-and-extraskeletal-health/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Subsequently, several meta-analyses showed that supplementation with vitamin D and calcium decreased the risk of osteoporotic fractures in older adults. The details of the protocols and overall results of the studies are reviewed separately.</p><p>In addition to its role in calcium and bone homeostasis, vitamin D potentially regulates many other cellular functions. The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is nearly universally expressed in nucleated cells. Approximately 3 percent of the <span class=\"nowrap\">human/mouse</span> genome is under the control of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the active form of vitamin D. Furthermore, at least 10 tissues outside the kidney express 1-alpha-hydroxylase (<em>CYP27B1</em>), the enzyme responsible for converting vitamin D to its active form, and therefore, the active hormone can be generated in an auto- or paracrine way. Thus, the spectrum of activity of the vitamin D endocrine system is much broader than <span class=\"nowrap\">calcium/bone</span> homeostasis, and in this regard, the vitamin D-VDR system resembles that of other ligands of nuclear receptors, such as thyroid hormone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-and-extraskeletal-health/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the &quot;extraskeletal&quot; effects of vitamin D (deficiency), especially its effect on muscle function, cancer, and on the immune, cardiovascular, and metabolic system. The skeletal manifestations, causes, and treatment of vitamin D deficiency are discussed elsewhere.

However, a causal relationship between vitamin D supplementation and improvement in muscle weakness has not been clearly demonstrated in randomized trials, and the optimal 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentration for muscle function is unknown. Any benefit of vitamin D supplementation on muscle strength is likely to occur in patients with baseline 25(OH)D levels below 10 or 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (25 or 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span>.</p><p>There are several lines of evidence that suggest a relationship between vitamin D and muscle function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-and-extraskeletal-health/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Muscle from vitamin D receptor (VDR)-null mice shows clear developmental abnormalities as immature muscle genes and proteins survive in VDR-null but not wild-type adult muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-and-extraskeletal-health/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition, striated muscle fibers are smaller in VDR-null mice. Adult skeletal muscle, however, does not seems to express VDR protein when measured by highly specific antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-and-extraskeletal-health/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], but VDR is expressed in muscle cell precursors or stem cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-and-extraskeletal-health/abstract/4,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10</a>]. Children with hereditary vitamin D deficiency (ie, genetic <em>CYP27B1</em> deficiency) who are deficient in the production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D have profound muscle weakness, which vitamin D or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D therapy rapidly improves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-and-extraskeletal-health/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition, vitamin D supplementation improved muscle weakness and recovery of energy stores (maximal mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation rate, as measured by in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy) after physical exercise in severely vitamin D-deficient but otherwise healthy adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-and-extraskeletal-health/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>In systematic reviews of randomized trials comparing vitamin D supplementation (with or without calcium) with placebo or calcium alone, the results are mixed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-and-extraskeletal-health/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. In a meta-analysis of 29 trials, there was a small but significant improvement in global muscle strength with vitamin D supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-and-extraskeletal-health/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, the meta-analysis was limited by significant heterogeneity. In another systematic review, among four trials with patients with baseline serum 25(OH)D &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (25 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L),</span> three showed improvement in some aspects of muscle strength with vitamin D supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-and-extraskeletal-health/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Few studies used proximal muscle strength (the most affected muscle function in clinical case reports) as a true endpoint, and few studies provided vitamin D supplementation in doses higher than 2000 international units per day.</p><p>In subsequent trials evaluating the effect of vitamin D supplementation on proximal muscle strength, there was little benefit, particularly at the highest doses (60,000 international units monthly). As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a trial from Norway, 251 healthy immigrant adults (from South Asia, Middle East, and Africa, mean age 36 to 39 years) with severe vitamin D deficiency (mean serum 25[OH]D 10.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [26 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L])</span> were randomly assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d3-cholecalciferol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin D3</a> supplementation (1000 or 400 international units daily) or to placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-and-extraskeletal-health/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. After 16 weeks, mean serum 25(OH)D levels improved in the active treatment groups (20.8 and 17.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [52 and 43 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L]</span> in the 1000 and 400 international unit dose groups, respectively). However, there were no differences in improvement in maximum jump height (a measure of proximal leg-muscle strength), chair-rising (proximal leg-muscle strength), or handgrip strength.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another trial, 200 older postmenopausal women (mean age 78 years) with mean serum 25(OH)D of 19 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (47.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> were randomly assigned to 24,000 or 60,000 international units of vitamin D monthly or to 24,000 international units plus 300 mcg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcifediol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcifediol</a> monthly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-and-extraskeletal-health/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. After 12 months, achieved mean serum 25(OH)D levels were approximately 30, 40, and 45 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (75, 100, and 112 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L),</span> respectively. Improvement in lower extremity function did not differ among the three groups.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H651654\"><span class=\"h2\">Falls</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence conflicts on the effectiveness of vitamin D for fall prevention in older adults, with emerging evidence that high-dose vitamin D administered monthly may increase fall risk. There are several meta-analyses showing a reduction in risk of falls (relative risk [RR] reduction as high as 20 percent) following vitamin D supplementation, particularly when the baseline vitamin D status is poor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-and-extraskeletal-health/abstract/18-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-22</a>]. In these trials, supplementation with doses ranging from 700 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/day</span> was effective.</p><p>A subsequent meta-analysis showed that overall, vitamin D supplementation in community-dwelling adults did not reduce falls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-and-extraskeletal-health/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. This meta-analysis included one large trial (n = 2256) that used very-high-dose vitamin D (single annual dose of 500,000 international units) and showed an increase in risk of falls and fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-and-extraskeletal-health/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In the vitamin D group, the median 25(OH)D concentrations after one and three months were approximately 48 and 36 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (120 and 90 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L),</span> respectively. Another trial comparing high (60,000 international units monthly or 24,000 international units plus 300 mcg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcifediol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcifediol</a> monthly) versus low (24,000 international units monthly) dose vitamin D supplementation similarly showed that postmenopausal women in the high-dose vitamin D groups had a higher incidence of falls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-and-extraskeletal-health/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. After 12 months, achieved mean serum 25(OH)D levels were approximately 40, 45, and 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (100, 112, and 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L),</span> respectively. These results suggest that intermittent high-dose supplementation should be avoided. General exercise reduces the risk of falls, and exercise programs that include balance components are most effective. Thus, a combined approach (vitamin D [700 to 1000 international units daily], calcium, exercise, and general interventions) may be most advantageous for the very elderly.</p><p>Fall prevention in older adults are reviewed in detail elsewhere.

The current evidence is insufficient to support large-dose vitamin D supplementation for cancer prevention or treatment.</p><p>In the 1930s and 1940s, it was observed that people living at higher latitudes were at higher risk of cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-and-extraskeletal-health/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Subsequently, living at a higher latitude was linked to ultraviolet B (UVB) exposure, and this observation introduced the possible link with vitamin D status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-and-extraskeletal-health/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. There is now a very extensive literature on vitamin D, cell proliferation, and cancer. In vitro studies have shown that the active hormone or its analogs can decrease cell proliferation, and a very large number of genes are coherently activated or inactivated to generate this effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-and-extraskeletal-health/abstract/4,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,27</a>]. In animal studies, deficiency of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) predisposes to precancerous lesions of the breast or intestine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-and-extraskeletal-health/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Colon cancer &ndash; Observational studies in humans (cross-sectional studies and especially long-term, prospective studies) revealed a link between poor vitamin D status (either evaluated by serum 25[OH]D or a surrogate estimation) and the risk of nearly all cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-and-extraskeletal-health/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>], but a reanalysis by a World Health Organization (WHO) working group identified colon cancer as the greatest risk associated with poor vitamin D status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-and-extraskeletal-health/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. This finding was supported by the results of a meta-analysis of nine case-control studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-and-extraskeletal-health/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. For each 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> increase in prediagnosis serum 25(OH)D concentration, there was a 6 percent (95% CI 3-9 percent) reduction in colorectal cancer risk. In one of the largest studies in the meta-analysis, a nested case-control study in European populations (2496 cases and controls), serum 25(OH)D levels between 10 and 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (25 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> compared with 20 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (50 to 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> were associated with a higher incidence of colorectal cancer (incidence rate ratio 1.28, 95% CI 1.05-1.56) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-and-extraskeletal-health/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In contrast to these results, a prospective case-control study did not show a significant association between vitamin D status and colon or colorectal cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-and-extraskeletal-health/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In addition, some observational studies have shown an elevated risk of some cancers (eg, pancreatic) at higher 25(OH)D levels (relative risk [RR] 2.12, 95% CI 1.23-3.64 for levels &ge;40 versus 20 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [&ge;100 versus 50 to 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L])</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-and-extraskeletal-health/abstract/35-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breast cancer &ndash; Observational studies examining the relationship between vitamin D and breast cancer report inconsistent results. A meta-analysis of prospective studies examining the relationship between serum 25(OH)D concentrations and breast cancer risk showed a significant inverse association in post- but not premenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-and-extraskeletal-health/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The risk of postmenopausal breast cancer decreased with 25(OH)D levels between 27 and &lt;35 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (67 to 87 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L),</span> with no further reduction for levels above 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span>.

In a meta-analysis of 18 randomized trials in predominantly older, community-dwelling women, vitamin D supplementation had no effect on the incidence of cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-and-extraskeletal-health/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In a trial published after the meta-analysis, 2303 healthy, postmenopausal women (mean baseline 25[OH]D 32.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [81.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L])</span> were randomly assigned to 2000 international units <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d3-cholecalciferol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin D3</a> and 1500 mg of calcium daily or identical placebos [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-and-extraskeletal-health/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. After four years, the proportion of patients in each group with newly diagnosed cancer did not significantly differ (3.89 and 5.58 percent, respectively, hazard ratio [HR] 0.70, 95% CI 0.47-1.02). An analysis by cancer site showed no difference in the incidence of breast cancer between the two groups; there were too few cancers at other sites to analyze. Study limitations include selection of patients with a relatively high baseline vitamin D level and permission to supplement with vitamin D (up to 800 international units daily) outside of the intervention, both of which may have contributed to the absence of an effect.</p><p>Additional trials are ongoing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitamin-d-and-extraskeletal-health/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H651669\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMUNE SYSTEM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vitamin D has major effects on nearly all cells of the immune system. Antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and T and B cells, express the vitamin D receptor (VDR). Thus, the VDR-vitamin D endocrine system can modulate most aspects of the innate and acquired immune system (and even mast cells) when challenged by extreme deficiency or exposure to high 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (or its analogs). However, vitamin D supplementation does not appear to reduce the incidence of upper respiratory infections in healthy adults with normal or near-normal serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels.

However, the small number of events reduced the precision of the analyses to detect a statistically significant clinical effect of prenatal vitamin D on the incidence of recurrent wheezing in early childhood. Thus, it remains unclear whether vitamin D supplementation has a role in asthma prevention.

Baseline serum 25(OH)D levels were not routinely reported, and supplementation was not initiated until 20 weeks of pregnancy or later.</p><p/><p>There are few data on timing of vitamin D supplementation. The earliest interventions made in published trials were in the late first trimester; initiation of therapy with vitamin D prior to conception has not been evaluated. Additional trials are needed to determine the optimal serum 25(OH)D level in pregnancy and whether vitamin D supplementation, particularly earlier in gestation, influences maternal and infant health outcomes.</p><p>In addition, more trials are needed to confirm the safety and efficacy of high-dose vitamin D supplementation in pregnant women with severe vitamin D deficiency. Severe and prolonged vitamin D deficiency can result in osteomalacia and, in pregnant women, cephalopelvic disproportion, necessitating cesarean delivery.
