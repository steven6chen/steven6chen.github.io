The intervention uses an alternating current passed through a metal coil placed against the scalp to generate rapidly alternating magnetic fields, which pass through the skull nearly unimpeded and induce electric currents that depolarize neurons in a focal area of the surface cortex; some TMS devices may also stimulate deeper brain structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-transcranial-magnetic-stimulation-tms/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. The magnetic field generated by repetitive TMS is comparable to that of a standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) device (approximately 1.5 to 3 Tesla); however, the TMS field is focal (beneath the coil), whereas the MRI field is large and fills the room housing the MRI device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-transcranial-magnetic-stimulation-tms/abstract/10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12</a>].

Surface cortical TMS is the most widely used and studied form of TMS. Other forms of TMS include deep TMS, accelerated TMS, high dose TMS, theta burst TMS, and bilateral TMS. (See <a href=\"#H3057643606\" class=\"local\">'Deep TMS'</a> below and <a href=\"#H863627873\" class=\"local\">'Experimental techniques'</a> below.) </p><p>The efficacy of surface cortical TMS is discussed separately.

The depth of stimulation is approximately 2 to 3 cm beneath the coil, and most repetitive TMS devices depolarize cortical neurons in a circular area with a diameter of about 2 to 3 cm. Parameters of repetitive TMS include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-transcranial-magnetic-stimulation-tms/abstract/10,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frequency &ndash; number of magnetic pulses per second (hertz).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>High (fast) frequency refers to stimulation delivered at &gt;1 pulse per second (typically 10 to 20 pulses per second) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Low (slow) frequency denotes stimulation delivered at &le;1 pulse per second</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intensity &ndash; expressed as a percentage of the resting motor threshold, which is established by stimulating the motor cortex and determining the minimum amount of energy that is required to evoke a motor response in a specific muscle group (generally the contralateral small hand muscles).

Generally, the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex is targeted, and neuroimaging of depressed patients has found hypoactivity in the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-transcranial-magnetic-stimulation-tms/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, some trials have stimulated the right dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, and other trials have sequentially or simultaneously stimulated two cortical sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-transcranial-magnetic-stimulation-tms/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. TMS of the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex has also been studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-transcranial-magnetic-stimulation-tms/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2851665461\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For acute treatment of unipolar major depression, repetitive TMS is usually administered by stimulating the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex daily (Monday through Friday) over four to six weeks, using the following parameters (see <a href=\"#H2136752143\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-transcranial-magnetic-stimulation-tms/abstract/8,10,11,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10,11,18,19</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>10 magnetic pulses per second (hertz)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>3000 pulses per session</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>100 to 120 percent of motor threshold (ie, the magnetic field intensity relative to the patient&rsquo;s resting motor threshold) </p><p/><p>However, the stimulation parameters required to optimize efficacy are not known, and administration of repetitive TMS is thus not standardized. As an example, meta-analyses have found that either low frequency (&le;1 pulse per second) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-transcranial-magnetic-stimulation-tms/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>] or high frequency (&ge;5 pulses per second) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-transcranial-magnetic-stimulation-tms/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>] repetitive TMS is more effective than sham treatment, and that the benefits of low frequency and high frequency repetitive TMS are comparable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-transcranial-magnetic-stimulation-tms/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Low frequency repetitive TMS is administered over the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and inhibits cortical activity, whereas high frequency repetitive TMS is administered over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and enhances cortical activity.</p><p>The number of treatments necessary for patients with acute major depression is not clear. Some authorities suggest that a trial of repetitive TMS should last a minimum of three to four weeks before determining whether the treatment is beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-transcranial-magnetic-stimulation-tms/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In addition, it is reasonable to extend treatment beyond six weeks for an additional two to six weeks for patients who have achieved a partial response that has not plateaued and for patients with a prior history of late response (eg, after 10 weeks) to antidepressant medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-transcranial-magnetic-stimulation-tms/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Evidence supporting treatment beyond six weeks includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an observational study, 73 patients with unipolar major depression who did not respond to daily repetitive TMS for four to six weeks were treated for an additional six weeks; response (improvement from baseline on the depression rating scale &ge; 50 percent) occurred in 26 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-transcranial-magnetic-stimulation-tms/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another observational study enrolled 61 patients who did not initially respond satisfactorily to acute TMS and then administered additional acute TMS, such that patients received a total of up to 12 weeks of acute TMS; remission occurred in 31 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-transcranial-magnetic-stimulation-tms/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p/><p>Treatments can be spaced rather than administered on a daily basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-transcranial-magnetic-stimulation-tms/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In a randomized trial, repetitive TMS given three days per week for six weeks (18 sessions) was compared with repetitive TMS given five days per week for four weeks (20 sessions) in 77 patients with major depression; improvement and tolerability were similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-transcranial-magnetic-stimulation-tms/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p>Positioning the magnetic coil to stimulate the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex is typically performed by first identifying the optimal spot on the scalp for evoking a motor evoked potential in the hand muscles, and then advancing the coil 5 cm anteriorly in a parasagittal plane along the skull surface (some authorities measure 6 to 7 cm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-transcranial-magnetic-stimulation-tms/abstract/10,14,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14,28</a>]. However, the utility of this approach is limited because patients have varying brain sizes and morphology. Thus, neuronavigation guided by magnetic resonance imaging scans has been used in some research protocols to localize the prefrontal cortex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-transcranial-magnetic-stimulation-tms/abstract/11,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,29</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Safety measures for repetitive TMS include use of hearing protection (eg, ear plugs) and keeping oxygen and anticonvulsant medications available for treatment of seizures, which are consistent with repetitive TMS safety guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-transcranial-magnetic-stimulation-tms/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. The risk of hearing loss and seizures is discussed elsewhere.

Concomitant psychotropic (eg, antidepressants) and nonpsychotropic medications are generally safe to use during a course of repetitive TMS for major depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-transcranial-magnetic-stimulation-tms/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>], and most clinicians continue currently prescribed antidepressant drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-transcranial-magnetic-stimulation-tms/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, proconvulsant medications (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupropion-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupropion</a>, tricyclics, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a>) should be tapered and discontinued prior to administering repetitive TMS, or used only if the potential benefit outweighs the increased risk and with monitoring of the motor threshold to ensure that stimulation intensity does not exceed the recommended safety range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-transcranial-magnetic-stimulation-tms/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Intensity is discussed elsewhere in this topic.

We recommend that all providers receive training through a formal university affiliated or industry independent certification course, or through peer to peer training, as well as industry sponsored training on the specific repetitive TMS system to be used.

However, it is reasonable for clinicians to taper TMS over two to three weeks before stopping it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-transcranial-magnetic-stimulation-tms/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. As an example, during a three-week taper, clinicians can administer three sessions in week 1, two sessions in week 2, and one session in the final week.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3539916064\"><span class=\"h2\">Maintenance treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with unipolar major depression who respond to acute repetitive TMS and are at risk for recurrence, it is reasonable to use TMS for maintenance treatment; TMS is usually given in conjunction with antidepressant medications but can be used as the sole treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-transcranial-magnetic-stimulation-tms/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Maintenance TMS typically uses the same stimulation parameters that were used during acute treatment, unless side effects necessitate changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-transcranial-magnetic-stimulation-tms/abstract/30,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,35,36</a>]. However, the frequency of sessions for maintenance TMS has not been standardized, and it is not known whether any specific schedule is superior to another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-transcranial-magnetic-stimulation-tms/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>The most common maintenance TMS schedule appears to be one in which the number of sessions is gradually tapered over several months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-transcranial-magnetic-stimulation-tms/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], and many clinicians determine the schedule based upon patient response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-transcranial-magnetic-stimulation-tms/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Examples of specific, reasonable maintenance schedules that have been studied include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective study of 42 patients, daily treatments were reduced to three sessions in week 1 of maintenance treatment, two sessions in week 2, and one in week 3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/technique-for-performing-transcranial-magnetic-stimulation-tms/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. After one session per week for four weeks, the schedule was tapered further to two sessions per month for two months and then to one session per month.

The maintenance TMS schedule was such that every month, patients received five sessions administered over three days. </p><p/><p>It is not known how long patients should receive maintenance TMS.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-indications-efficacy-and-safety-of-transcranial-magnetic-stimulation-tms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Indications, efficacy, and safety of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TMS modulates activity in cortical regions and associated neural circuits by passing an alternating current through a metal coil placed against the scalp to generate rapidly alternating magnetic fields, which pass through the skull and induce electric currents that depolarize neurons in a focal area of the surface cortex. TMS is delivered as a series of pulses called a train; stimulation parameters include frequency, intensity, train duration, intertrain interval, and number of trains per session. (See <a href=\"#H2136752143\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1873189403\" class=\"local\">'Treatment parameters'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TMS that stimulates the surface cortex is called surface cortical TMS, and is the most widely used and studied form of TMS. (See <a href=\"#H2999530315\" class=\"local\">'Surface cortical TMS'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Surface cortical TMS generally targets the left dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, but some studies have stimulated the right dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex. (See <a href=\"#H1289079121\" class=\"local\">'Stimulation site'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For treating unipolar major depression, acute TMS is usually administered daily over four to six weeks, using 10 magnetic pulses per second; 3000 pulses per session; and 100 to 120 percent of motor threshold. (See <a href=\"#H2851665461\" class=\"local\">'Acute treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>However, the stimulation parameters, number of treatments, and position of the magnetic coil required to optimize efficacy for major depression are not known and administration is thus not standardized. It is reasonable to extend treatment beyond six weeks for an additional two to six weeks for patients who have achieved a partial response that has not plateaued and for patients with a prior history of late response (eg, after 10 weeks) to antidepressant medications. (See <a href=\"#H2851665461\" class=\"local\">'Acute treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A psychiatrist should supervise the procedure, and safety measures include ear plugs and keeping oxygen and anticonvulsant medications available for treatment of seizures. Proconvulsant medications should generally be discontinued prior to administering repetitive TMS. (See <a href=\"#H2851665461\" class=\"local\">'Acute treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintenance TMS typically uses the same stimulation parameters that were used during acute treatment, unless side effects intervene. The most common maintenance TMS schedule appears to be one in which the number of sessions is gradually tapered over several months, and many clinicians determine the schedule based upon patient response. (See <a href=\"#H3539916064\" class=\"local\">'Maintenance treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TMS devices have been developed that theoretically stimulate brain structures beneath the superficial prefrontal cortex. (See <a href=\"#H3057643606\" class=\"local\">'Deep TMS'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Investigational techniques for administering TMS include an accelerated schedule as well as high dose, theta burst, and bilateral stimulation.
