These symptoms result from inflammation in the larynx and subglottic airway. A barking cough is the hallmark of croup among infants and young children, whereas hoarseness predominates in older children and adults. Although croup usually is a mild and self-limited illness, significant upper airway obstruction, respiratory distress, and, rarely, death, can occur.</p><p>The clinical features, evaluation, and diagnosis of croup will be discussed here. The management of croup is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=croup-approach-to-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Croup: Approach to management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=croup-pharmacologic-and-supportive-interventions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Croup: Pharmacologic and supportive interventions&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term croup has been used to describe a variety of upper respiratory conditions in children, including laryngitis, laryngotracheitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, bacterial tracheitis, or spasmodic croup [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These terms are defined below. In the past, the term croup also has been applied to laryngeal diphtheria (diphtheritic or membranous croup), which is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathophysiology-of-diphtheria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathophysiology of diphtheria&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-diphtheria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of diphtheria&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Throughout this review, the term croup will be used to refer to laryngotracheitis. Laryngotracheobronchitis, laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis, bacterial tracheitis, and spasmodic croup are designated specifically as such.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Laryngitis</strong> &ndash; Laryngitis refers to inflammation limited to the larynx and manifests itself as hoarseness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. It usually occurs in older children and adults and, similar to croup, is frequently caused by a viral infection. The etiology, management, and evaluation of other causes of hoarseness are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=common-causes-of-hoarseness-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Common causes of hoarseness in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hoarseness-in-children-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hoarseness in children: Evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Laryngotracheitis (croup)</strong> &ndash; Laryngotracheitis (croup) refers to inflammation of the larynx and trachea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Although lower airway signs are absent, the typical barking cough will be present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Laryngotracheobronchitis (LTB)</strong> &ndash; LTB occurs when inflammation extends into the bronchi, resulting in lower airway signs (eg, wheezing, crackles, air trapping, increased tachypnea) and sometimes more severe illness than laryngotracheitis alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This term commonly is used interchangeably with laryngotracheitis, and the entities are often indistinct clinically. Further extension of inflammation into the lower airways results in laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis, which sometimes can be complicated by bacterial superinfection. Bacterial superinfection can be manifest as pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, or bacterial tracheitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bacterial tracheitis</strong> &ndash; Bacterial tracheitis (also called bacterial croup) describes bacterial infection of the trachea, resulting in a thick, purulent exudate, which causes symptoms of upper airway obstruction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55364\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55364 \">picture 1</a>). The bronchi and lungs are typically involved as well (ie, bacterial tracheobronchitis). Bacterial tracheitis may occur as a complication of viral respiratory infections (usually those which manifest themselves as LTB or laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis) or as a primary bacterial infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-tracheitis-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial tracheitis in children: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Spasmodic croup</strong> &ndash; Spasmodic croup is characterized by the sudden onset of inspiratory stridor at night, short duration (several hours), and sudden cessation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This is often in the setting of a mild upper respiratory infection, but without fever or inflammation. A striking feature of spasmodic croup is its recurrent nature, hence the alternate descriptive term, &quot;frequently recurrent croup.&quot; Because of some clinical overlap with atopic diseases, it is sometimes referred to as &quot;allergic croup.&quot; Eosinophilic esophagitis may be an underlying issue in a subset of children with spasmodic croup [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-eosinophilic-esophagitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Atypical croup</strong> &ndash; Atypical croup may be defined as recurrent episodes of croup-like symptoms occurring beyond the typical age range for viral croup (ie, six months to three years) or recurrent episodes that do not appear to be simple &quot;spasmodic croup&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. We consider &quot;spasmodic croup&quot; to be distinct from &quot;atypical croup,&quot; although the terms are sometimes used interchangeably.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Croup is usually caused by viruses. Bacterial infection may occur secondarily, as described above.</p><p>Parainfluenza virus type 1 is the most common cause of acute laryngotracheitis, especially the fall and winter epidemics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Parainfluenza type 2 sometimes causes croup outbreaks, but usually with milder disease than type 1. Parainfluenza type 3 causes sporadic cases of croup that often are more severe than those due to types 1 and 2. In multicenter surveillance of children &lt;5 years who were hospitalized with febrile or acute respiratory illnesses, 43 percent of children with confirmed parainfluenza infection were diagnosed with croup [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Croup was the most common discharge diagnosis for children with confirmed parainfluenza 1 (42 percent) and parainfluenza 2 (48 percent) infections but was only diagnosed in 11 percent of children with confirmed parainfluenza 3 infections. Compared with types 1 to 3, infection caused by parainfluenza virus type 4 is less likely to be associated with stridor and croup in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The microbiology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology of parainfluenza infections are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parainfluenza-viruses-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parainfluenza viruses in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A number of other viruses that typically cause lower respiratory tract disease also can cause upper respiratory tract symptoms, including croup, as described below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory syncytial virus and adenoviruses are relatively frequent causes of croup. The laryngotracheal component of disease is usually less significant than that of the lower airways.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-metapneumovirus-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human metapneumovirus infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Croup also may be caused by bacteria. <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em> has been associated with mild cases of croup. In addition, secondary bacterial infection may occur in children with laryngotracheitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, or laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis. The most common secondary bacterial pathogens include <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, <em>Streptococcus pyogenes</em>, and <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Croup most commonly occurs in children 6 to 36 months of age. It is seen in younger infants (as young as three months) and in preschool children, but it is uncommon in children &gt;6 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14</a>]. It is more common in boys, with a male:female ratio of approximately 1.4:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14-16</a>].</p><p>Family history of croup is a risk factor for croup and recurrent croup. In a case-control study, children whose parents had a history of croup were 3.2 times as likely to have an episode of croup and 4.1 times as likely to have recurrent croup as children with no parental history of croup [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Parental smoking, a well-recognized risk factor for respiratory tract infections in children, does not appear to increase the risk of croup [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondhand smoke exposure: Effects in children&quot;, section on 'Respiratory symptoms and illness'</a>.)</p><p>Most cases of croup occur in the fall or early winter, with the major incidence peaks coinciding with parainfluenza type 1 activity (often in October) and minor peaks occurring during periods of respiratory syncytial virus or influenza virus activity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory syncytial virus infection: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Seasonality'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seasonal-influenza-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seasonal influenza in children: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Influenza activity'</a>.)</p><p>Emergency department (ED) visits for croup are most frequent between 10:00 PM and 4:00 AM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, children seen for croup between noon and 6:00 PM are more likely to be admitted to the hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,20</a>]. A morning peak between 7:00 AM and 11:00 AM in ED visits for croup also has been noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Hospital admissions for croup have declined steadily since the late 1970s. In an analysis of data from the National Hospital Discharge Surveys from 1979 through 1997, the estimated number of annual hospitalizations for croup decreased from 48,900 to 33,500 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Estimates of annual hospitalization rates for croup caused by parainfluenza virus types 1 to 3 from 1994 to 1997 were 0.4 to 1.1 per 1000 children for children younger than one year and 0.24 to 0.61 per 1000 children for children between one and four years. Approximately one-half of these hospitalizations were attributed to parainfluenza type 1.</p><p>In a six-year (1999 to 2005) population-based study, 5.6 percent of children with a diagnosis of croup in the ED required hospital admission. Among those discharged home, 4.4 percent had a repeat ED visit within 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The viruses that cause croup typically infect the nasal and pharyngeal mucosal epithelia initially and then spread locally along the respiratory epithelium to the larynx and trachea.</p><p>The anatomic hallmark of croup is narrowing of the subglottic airway, the portion of the larynx immediately below the vocal folds. The cricoid cartilage of the subglottis is a complete cartilaginous ring, unlike the tracheal rings which are horseshoe shaped. Because it is a complete ring, the cricoid cannot expand, causing significant airway narrowing whenever the subglottic mucosa becomes inflamed. In addition to this &quot;fixed&quot; obstruction, dynamic obstruction of the extrathoracic trachea below the cartilaginous ring may occur when the child struggles, cries, or becomes agitated. The dynamic obstruction occurs as a result of the combination of high negative pressure in the distal extrathoracic trachea and the floppiness of the tracheal wall in children.</p><p>Laryngoscopic evaluation of patients during acute laryngotracheitis shows redness and swelling in the area just below the vocal folds. In severe cases, the subglottic airway may be reduced to a diameter of 1 to 2 mm. In addition to mucosal edema and swelling, fibrinous exudates and, occasionally, pseudomembranes can build up on the tracheal surfaces and contribute to airway narrowing. The vocal folds and laryngeal tissues also can become swollen, and cord mobility may be impaired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,21-23</a>]. Autopsy studies in children with laryngotracheitis show infiltration of histiocytes, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils into edematous lamina propria, submucosa, and adventitia of the larynx and trachea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>].</p><p>In spasmodic or recurrent croup, findings on direct laryngoscopy may demonstrate noninflammatory edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This suggests that there is no direct viral involvement of the tracheal epithelium. In a retrospective case series of 197 children with recurrent croup who underwent endoscopy at a single center from 2002 to 2012, 21 percent had evidence of subglottic stenosis and 20 percent had abnormal esophageal biopsies (including evidence of reflux esophagitis, eosinophilic esophagitis, and candidal esophagitis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Children with subglottic stenosis tended to be younger compared with those without (mean age 35 versus 58 months). In another case series of 103 children with recurrent croup who underwent endoscopy at a single center from 2004 to 2013, 44 percent had a history of prior intubation, subglottic stenosis, or a previous airway procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Other common underlying conditions included asthma (64 percent), gastroesophageal reflux (60 percent), and seasonal allergies (48 percent). Endoscopy was normal in 65 percent of the children in this series; 9 percent of children had moderate to severe findings (including subglottic stenosis, cyst, and hemangioma).</p><p>Patients with bacterial tracheitis have a bacterial superinfection that causes thick pus to develop within the lumen of the subglottic trachea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55364\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55364 \">picture 1</a>). Ulcerations, pseudomembranes, and microabscesses of the mucosal surface occur. The supraglottic tissues usually are normal.

Although croup usually is a mild and self-limited illness, specific features of the history and physical examination identify children who are seriously ill or at risk for rapid progression of disease. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Laryngotracheitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laryngotracheitis typically occurs in children three months to three years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The onset of symptoms is usually gradual, beginning with nasal discharge, congestion, and coryza. Symptoms generally progress over 12 to 48 hours to include fever, hoarseness, barking cough, and stridor. Respiratory distress increases as upper airway obstruction becomes more severe. Rapid progression or signs of lower airway involvement suggests a more serious illness. Cough usually resolves within three days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]; other symptoms may persist for seven days with a gradual return to normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Deviation from this expected course should prompt consideration of diagnoses other than laryngotracheitis. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The degree of upper airway obstruction is evident on physical examination, as described below. In mild cases, the child is hoarse and has nasal congestion. There is minimal, if any, pharyngitis. As airway obstruction progresses, stridor develops, and there may be mild tachypnea with a prolonged inspiratory phase. The presence of stridor is a key element in the assessment of severity. Biphasic stridor (stridor heard on both inspiration and expiration) at rest is a sign of significant upper airway obstruction. As upper airway obstruction progresses, the child may become restless or anxious. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Severity assessment'</a> below.)</p><p>When airway obstruction becomes severe, suprasternal, subcostal, and intercostal retractions may be seen. Breath sounds can be diminished. Agitation, which generally is accompanied by increased inspiratory effort, exacerbates the subglottic narrowing by creating negative pressure in the airway.

In contrast to laryngotracheitis, spasmodic croup always occurs at night; the duration of symptoms is short, often with symptoms subsiding by the time of presentation for medical attention; and the onset and cessation of symptoms are abrupt. Fever is typically absent, but mild upper respiratory tract symptoms (eg, coryza) may be present. Episodes can recur within the same night and for two to four successive evenings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. A striking feature of spasmodic croup is its recurrent nature, hence the alternate descriptive term, &quot;frequently recurrent croup.&quot; There may be a familial predisposition to spasmodic croup, and it may be more common in children with a family history of allergies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Early in the clinical course, spasmodic croup may be difficult to distinguish from laryngotracheitis.

Is there stridor at rest? Stridor at rest is a sign of significant upper airway obstruction. Children with significant upper airway obstruction may prefer to sit up and lean forward in a &quot;sniffing&quot; position (neck is mildly flexed, and head is mildly extended). This position tends to improve the patency of the upper airway.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quality of the voice &ndash; Does the child have a hoarse or diminished cry?

Inspiratory stridor indicates upper airway obstruction, whereas expiratory wheezing is a sign of lower airway obstruction. If there is stridor, is it present at rest or only with agitation? As discussed above, stridor at rest is a sign of significant upper airway obstruction. Stridor will be more obvious on auscultation, since the inspiratory noise is transmitted through the chest. The presence of crackles (rales) also suggests lower respiratory tract involvement (eg, laryngotracheobronchitis, laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis, or bacterial tracheitis).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment of hydration status &ndash; Decreased oral intake and increased insensible losses from fever and tachypnea may result in dehydration.

Onset of symptoms is rapid, and because of the associated bacteremia, the child is highly febrile, pale, toxic, and ill-appearing. Because of the swollen epiglottis, the child will have difficulty swallowing and is often drooling. The children usually prefer to sit up and seldom have observed cough [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

If an inhaled foreign body lodges in the larynx, it will produce hoarseness and stridor. If a large foreign body is swallowed, it may lodge in the upper esophagus, resulting in distortion of the adjacent soft extrathoracic trachea, producing a barking cough and inspiratory stridor. Ingestion of a non-obstructive but subsequently erosive foreign bodies such as a button battery may produce stridor more remote from the time of ingestion that persist or recur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/croup-clinical-features-evaluation-and-diagnosis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].
