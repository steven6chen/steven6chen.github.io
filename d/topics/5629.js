Because biochemical-marker screening for Down syndrome involves measuring levels of the same markers that perform well for detecting trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome, the second most common autosomal trisomy among live births), biochemical-marker screening tests provide risk assessment for both chromosomal abnormalities. Some screening tests also provide risk assessment for trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome). Because both the birth prevalence and long-term survival are much higher for Down syndrome than for trisomies 18 and 13, this topic will focus on Down syndrome.</p><p>Issues related to prenatal screening for Down syndrome will be reviewed here.

Adverse psychological effects include fear of discovering an affected fetus and concern about possible complications from diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, particularly procedure-related loss of a normal fetus. Most parents are anxious when they receive a positive screening test result, even though most positive serum screening results are associated with a normal pregnancy outcome. Although anxiety is reduced when a diagnostic procedure shows an unaffected pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-overview-of-prenatal-screening/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], women who experience a false-positive screening result are less likely to choose screening in a subsequent pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-overview-of-prenatal-screening/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94717344\"><span class=\"h1\">COUNSELING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The key principle when counseling patients about prenatal screening for Down syndrome is to provide clear, easily understood, and complete information that allows them to make informed, preference-based screening and diagnostic testing decisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-overview-of-prenatal-screening/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. It should be clear that testing is voluntary.</p><p>The approach should be nondirective. Nondirective information enables patients to balance the risks, limitations, and benefits of prenatal screening with the issues involved in raising a child with a chromosomal abnormality or pregnancy termination.</p><p>Basic information on prenatal screening and diagnosis can be given to patients individually, in a group session, or with decision aids. A randomized trial found that all three approaches were useful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-overview-of-prenatal-screening/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Couples were most satisfied with individual counseling, but those in group sessions showed a significantly greater increase in knowledge from pre- to post-intervention questionnaires than those assigned to the other approaches.

Assessment of maternal serum levels of specific biochemical markers associated with Down syndrome, with or without assessment of specific ultrasound markers, is the most widely used approach for screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-overview-of-prenatal-screening/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] and the approach the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends for first-line screening for most women in the general obstetric population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-overview-of-prenatal-screening/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This approach may also detect other less common disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71552\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71552 \">table 2</a>). </p><p>A test that measures cell-free DNA in maternal blood is also available. This test is recommended for women whose pregnancy has been identified as high risk of aneuploidy (see <a href=\"#H94717421\" class=\"local\">'Screen-positive test result'</a> below). Implementation of cell-free DNA for initial screening in women at low risk of fetal aneuploidy is controversial, primarily because of cost.</p><p>Serum screening test options for Down syndrome are summarized below and in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57348\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57348 \">table 3</a>). In general, multiple marker tests with first trimester ultrasound measurement of nuchal translucency (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57445\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57445 \">figure 1</a>) perform better than tests with fewer markers, tests with multiple markers without ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-overview-of-prenatal-screening/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], or ultrasound examination alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-overview-of-prenatal-screening/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94717365\"><span class=\"h2\">Second trimester quadruple test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The quadruple test measures the level of the biochemical markers alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), unconjugated estriol (uE3), human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and inhibin A in maternal serum. Maternal serum AFP and uE3 levels are, on average, reduced by 25 to 30 percent in pregnancies affected by Down syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-overview-of-prenatal-screening/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>], and hCG and inhibin A levels are, on average, twice as high as those in unaffected pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-overview-of-prenatal-screening/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>].</p><p>The quadruple test is ideally performed at 15 to 18 weeks of gestation but can be done as late as 22 weeks. In 2011 and 2012, the quadruple test was the most common Down syndrome screening test performed in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-overview-of-prenatal-screening/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. It has replaced the triple test (AFP, uE3, hCG).</p><p>For women who first present for prenatal care in the second trimester, the quadruple test is the best available biochemical marker-based screening test for Down syndrome. Since it involves measurement of AFP, it also serves as a screening test for open neural tube defects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=open-neural-tube-defects-risk-factors-prenatal-screening-and-diagnosis-and-pregnancy-management#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Open neural tube defects: Risk factors, prenatal screening and diagnosis, and pregnancy management&quot;, section on 'Timing'</a>.)</p><p>An elevated risk of trisomy 18, when present, is also reported (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71552\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71552 \">table 2</a>). Some screening programs include reporting of elevated risk of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS), when present. Trisomy 13 is not detected by the quadruple test.

In most patients, both ultrasound and biochemical marker screening are performed at 11 to 13 weeks of gestation. However, some protocols allow for earlier collection of the serum sample (beginning at nine weeks) with the ultrasound performed later (11 to 13 weeks). If the combined test is offered, chorionic villus sampling (CVS) should be available for definitive prenatal diagnosis. Waiting several weeks after a screen positive first trimester result to have an amniocentesis at 15 weeks of gestation or later should be avoided. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=first-trimester-combined-test-and-integrated-tests-for-screening-for-down-syndrome-and-trisomy-18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;First-trimester combined test and integrated tests for screening for Down syndrome and trisomy 18&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For women in whom early diagnosis is the priority, the combined test is the best available biochemical marker-based screening test for Down syndrome. Since it does not include measurement of second trimester AFP, maternal serum AFP or sonographic screening for open fetal neural tube defects, if desired, needs to be performed in the second trimester. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=open-neural-tube-defects-risk-factors-prenatal-screening-and-diagnosis-and-pregnancy-management#H606090749\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Open neural tube defects: Risk factors, prenatal screening and diagnosis, and pregnancy management&quot;, section on 'Screening tests'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94717377\"><span class=\"h2\">Tests integrated across the first and second trimesters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Integrated screening tests measure biochemical markers of Down syndrome in both the first and second trimesters, and may or may not include ultrasound measurement of nuchal translucency. Since the second trimester portion of the integrated test includes measurement of maternal serum AFP levels, these tests also screen for open neural tube defects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=first-trimester-combined-test-and-integrated-tests-for-screening-for-down-syndrome-and-trisomy-18#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;First-trimester combined test and integrated tests for screening for Down syndrome and trisomy 18&quot;, section on 'Integrated tests'</a>.)</p><p>There are three types of integrated test:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The <strong>full integrated test</strong> measures serum PAPP-A at 10 to 13 weeks and sonographic NT at 11 to 13 weeks as the first step. These results are integrated with results of the quadruple test performed on a second serum sample collected at 15 to 18 weeks to determine the risk of trisomy 21. (See <a href=\"#H94717365\" class=\"local\">'Second trimester quadruple test'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For women who prioritize a high detection rate over first trimester diagnosis, the full integrated test is the best biochemical marker-based screening test. When similar detection rates for Down syndrome are set, the full integrated test has a lower false positive rate than the combined test, the quadruple test, or the serum integrated test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57348\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57348 \">table 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The <strong>serum integrated test</strong> differs from the full integrated test by not including ultrasound measurement of nuchal translucency. For patients in areas where expertise in measurement of nuchal translucency is not available, this test provides an option for high detection of Down syndrome with lower false positive rates than the quadruple screen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57348\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57348 \">table 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Step-wise sequential testing</strong> is a modified version of the full integrated test that provides risk estimates after the first step [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-overview-of-prenatal-screening/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In most protocols, the sequential screening process involves performing the first trimester portion of the full integrated test, reporting risks of Down syndrome to the patient, and offering CVS to women whose results place them at very high risk of an affected fetus (eg, &ge;1 in 50). Women whose screen does not place them at very high risk go on to complete the second trimester portion of the test. The advantage of this approach is that women at highest risk benefit from early detection of affected fetuses while women at lower risk benefit from the high detection rate and low false positive rates of second trimester screening. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H841113\"><span class=\"h2\">Cell-free DNA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testing for cell-free DNA in maternal blood is another method for screening for Down syndrome. Maternal plasma cell-free DNA screening programs can detect more than 99 percent of pregnancies affected by Down syndrome with a screen-positive rate of &lt;0.2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-overview-of-prenatal-screening/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, 1 to 5 percent (or more) of samples fail to produce an interpretation, even after repeat testing.

The cost has been falling over time and patient cost varies depending on factors such as choice of laboratory and insurance.</p><p>Cell-free DNA screening can be used as a primary screening test in the following high risk groups:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maternal age 35 years or older at delivery</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetal ultrasound finding of a soft marker associated with an increased risk of aneuploidy for trisomies 13, 18, or 21.

In one of these trials, over 15,000 pregnant women presenting for aneuploidy screening at 10 to 14 weeks of gestation at 35 international centers underwent both standard screening (with measurement of nuchal translucency and biochemical markers) and cell-free DNA testing regardless of their baseline risk of aneuploidy (mean maternal age 31 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-overview-of-prenatal-screening/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Cell-free DNA screening had higher sensitivity for detection of Down syndrome <span class=\"nowrap\">(38/38</span> [100 percent] versus <span class=\"nowrap\">30/38</span> [78.9 percent]), a lower false positive rate (0.06 versus 5.4 percent), and a higher positive predictive value (80.9 percent versus 3.4 percent). Other studies have affirmed the high sensitivity and specificity of this test in both high- and low-risk populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-overview-of-prenatal-screening/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H587584287\"><span class=\"h2\">Second-trimester triple test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The triple test evaluates&nbsp;three second-trimester maternal serum markers, typically AFP, free or total hCG, and unconjugated estriol, in combination with maternal age to estimate risk of Down syndrome.

A secondary screening test aims to collect additional information about risk that screen-positive women can use in deciding whether to proceed to diagnostic testing. Secondary screening is performed with a cell-free DNA test. Because of the high sensitivity and specificity of cell-free DNA tests, many patients with false positive biochemical marker tests will be reclassified as screen-negative with minimal risk of misclassification of true positives. Women who choose secondary screening with a cell-free DNA test and are secondary screen-positive should be offered an invasive test for definitive diagnosis because false positive results are possible (&lt;0.1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-overview-of-prenatal-screening/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]). Alternatively, a patient who screens positive may decide that she wants a definitive diagnosis, which is provided by invasive testing (chorionic villus sampling [CVS], or amniocentesis). Each approach has advantages and disadvantages (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F100492\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef100492 \">table 4</a>). After a positive screening test, it is helpful for parents to meet with a genetic counselor to inform them of their diagnostic and management options and answer questions.</p><p>Biochemical marker screening tests should not be repeated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-overview-of-prenatal-screening/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Repeat testing of the entire population would result in a small increase in detection rates but is not justified because of the expense and risk of false reassurance. Repeat biochemical marker testing limited to only screen-positive women can reduce the false positive rate, but a small percentage of affected pregnancies will incorrectly reclassified as screen-negative. However, it is prudent to double-check the laboratory form to make sure the woman's age, weight, gestational age information, and other important factors were recorded correctly, as these can affect the risk calculation. If an ultrasound has not been done, it should be performed to confirm gestational age and exclude other causes of a screen-positive test (eg, multiple gestation, some congenital anomalies).

Preliminary results can be obtained within two days if a direct preparation is performed; final results from cultured cells take 7 to 10 days. In the second trimester, amniocentesis is performed to obtain fetal cells for chromosomal analysis. A rapid targeted screening result may be available within two days, but complete karyotype results from cultured cells take about 8 to 14 days. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chorionic-villus-sampling\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chorionic villus sampling&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-amniocentesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic amniocentesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Fluorescent in situ hybridization targets chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X, and Y. It is used for rapid aneuploidy screening after amniocentesis and can be performed on interphase cytotrophoblasts from CVS, if the direct preparation fails to yield sufficient useable metaphases for a complete karyotype. Analysis of the full karyotype is generally performed to allow detection of any aneuploidy (not just Down syndrome and trisomy 18) as well as detection of major structural chromosomal abnormalities (eg, translocations, inversions, marker chromosomes). </p><p>Some clinicians advocate microarray as a first-line test whenever fetal chromosomal analysis is planned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-overview-of-prenatal-screening/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. It provides more genetic information than a conventional karyotype (eg, microdeletions, microduplications) but is not more effective for diagnosis of Down syndrome and trisomy 18 and is more costly than a conventional karyotype.

Presumably, many of these losses are related to severe structural anomalies and growth restriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-overview-of-prenatal-screening/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

By comparison, the risk of fetal demise was 0.4 percent in the reference population of singleton pregnancies without anomalies or Down syndrome. For trisomy 18, spontaneous loss will occur before birth in 70 percent of fetuses viable at 12 weeks of gestation and 33 percent of those viable at 39 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-overview-of-prenatal-screening/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. For trisomy 13, spontaneous loss before birth will occur in 50 percent of fetuses alive at 12 weeks and 16 percent alive at 39 weeks. </p><p>There are no studies on use of nonstress testing, the biophysical profile, or other antepartum tests for fetal assessment to monitor the fetus with Down syndrome. It is reasonable to use these tests for the usual obstetrical indications (eg, fetal growth restriction, oligohydramnios, preeclampsia, decreased fetal movement). A retrospective review of 64 pregnancies with a Down syndrome fetus reported delivery for new-onset nonreassuring antepartum fetal surveillance in 35.9 percent of the pregnancies and the average gestational age at delivery was 36.9&nbsp;weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/down-syndrome-overview-of-prenatal-screening/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

Women should have the option of invasive diagnostic testing, regardless of maternal age. A diagnostic test rather than screening is a reasonable choice for women at high risk of Down syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H844282\" class=\"local\">'Candidates for prenatal screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pretest counseling should provide clear, easily understood, nondirective, and complete information that allows patients to make informed, preference-based screening and diagnostic testing decisions.

(See <a href=\"#H94717358\" class=\"local\">'Screening tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The most commonly used Down syndrome screening test in the United States is the quadruple test, which has a detection rate of about 80 percent at a 5 percent false positive rate. Serum test &ldquo;failures&rdquo; are rare, while failure to obtain ultrasound measurements of nuchal translucency occurs occasionally (&lt;2 percent). The quadruple test is the best serum screening test for women who present for prenatal care in the second trimester. (See <a href=\"#H94717365\" class=\"local\">'Second trimester quadruple test'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The first trimester combined test is the best serum screening option for women whose most important goal is to obtain their estimate of risk of Down syndrome early in pregnancy. Measurement of alpha-fetoprotein is recommended in the second trimester for detection of neural tube defects. (See <a href=\"#H94717371\" class=\"local\">'First trimester combined test'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The full integrated test has the highest detection rate for Down syndrome, the lowest rate of procedure-related losses per woman screened (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57348\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57348 \">table 3</a>), and includes screening for open neural tube defects. The serum integrated test has the highest detection rate for any serum screening test in which nuchal translucency measurement is not used.

Published validation studies have generally been limited to women at high risk of fetal aneuploidy. If cost is not an issue, we recommend cell-free DNA screening rather than biochemical marker-based screening for Down syndrome (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Cell-free DNA screening has higher sensitivity for detection of Down syndrome and a lower false positive rate, which leads to more cases detected with far fewer invasive procedures.

Because of the high sensitivity and specificity of cell-free DNA tests, many patients with false positive biochemical marker tests will be reclassified as screen-negative with minimal risk of misclassification of true positives.

No further testing is indicated, although a negative screen cannot completely exclude the possibility of Down syndrome. A negative screen also does not exclude the possibility of a fetus with a chromosomal abnormality other than Down syndrome but detectable with diagnostic testing.
