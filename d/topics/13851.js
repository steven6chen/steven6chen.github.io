However, only <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polymyxin-b-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">polymyxin B</a> and polymyxin E (also known as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colistin-colistimethate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colistin</a>) are in clinical use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymyxins-an-overview/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. They were isolated from <em>Paenibacillus</em> <em>polymyxa</em> and became available for clinical use in the 1950s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymyxins-an-overview/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Colistin was historically given as an intramuscular injection for the treatment of gram-negative bacterial infections, but fell out of favor after aminoglycosides became available because of its significant side effects, particularly nephrotoxicity. </p><p>More recently, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polymyxin-b-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">polymyxin B</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colistin-colistimethate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colistin</a> have been used more frequently in the treatment of otherwise panresistant nosocomial infections, especially those due to <em>Pseudomonas</em> and <em>Acinetobacter</em> spp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymyxins-an-overview/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>]. They are also used in aerosolized form for patients with cystic fibrosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-antibiotic-therapy-for-chronic-pulmonary-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Antibiotic therapy for chronic pulmonary infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=polymyxin-b-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Polymyxin B</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colistin-colistimethate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colistin</a> have almost identical chemical structures and comparable mechanisms of action, resistance patterns, and spectra of activity. However, they have very different pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymyxins-an-overview/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. These will all be reviewed here along with their adverse effects. The clinical settings in which the polymyxins may be used are discussed separately in the appropriate topic reviews.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF ACTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Polymyxins are bactericidal drugs that bind to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and phospholipids in the outer cell membrane of gram-negative bacteria. They competitively displace divalent cations from the phosphate groups of membrane lipids, which leads to disruption of the outer cell membrane, leakage of intracellular contents, and bacterial death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymyxins-an-overview/abstract/3,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10,11</a>].</p><p>In addition to their bactericidal effect, the polymyxins can bind and neutralize LPS and may reduce the pathophysiologic effects of endotoxin in the circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymyxins-an-overview/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3865759524\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECTRUM OF ACTIVITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Polymyxins have a narrow antibacterial spectrum limited to a subset of gram-negative bacilli. They are primarily used for infections due to multidrug-resistant organisms, such as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (<em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae,</em> some <em>Enterobacter</em> spp), <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, and <em>Acinetobacter baumannii</em>. Other susceptible organisms include <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, <em>Bordetella pertussis</em>, <em>Legionella pneumophila</em>, <em>Salmonella</em> spp, <em>Shigella</em> spp, and the majority of <em>Stenotrophomonas maltophilia</em> strains (74 percent of 23 tested isolates in one report) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymyxins-an-overview/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>On the other hand, <em>Burkholderia cepacia</em>, <em>Serratia marcescens</em>, <em>Moraxella catarrhalis</em>, <em>Proteus</em> spp, <em>Providencia</em> spp, and <em>Morganella morganii</em> are all resistant to polymyxins. Other inherently resistant organisms include all gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative cocci. </p><p>Organisms with variable resistance include <em>Aeromonas</em>, <em>Vibrio</em>, <em>Prevotella</em>, and <em>Fusobacterium</em> spp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymyxins-an-overview/abstract/3,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,15,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RESISTANCE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3503676388\"><span class=\"h2\">Prevalence and mechanisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Resistance to the polymyxins is rare, although there have been increasing reports of polymyxin resistance among carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacilli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymyxins-an-overview/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]. Furthermore, the identification of plasmid-mediated resistance to the polymyxins via the <em>mcr-1</em> gene raises concern for continued widespread dissemination of resistance.</p><p>The mechanisms of polymyxin resistance remain the subject of ongoing research, although a common mechanism appears to be modification of the lipid A component of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Other mechanisms may include cessation of LPS production or activation of efflux pumps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymyxins-an-overview/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Heteroresistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colistin-colistimethate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colistin</a> has been demonstrated in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymyxins-an-overview/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. </p><p>Plasmid-mediated resistance to the polymyxins due to an enzyme that modifies lipid A (a phosphoethanolamine transferase) and can be transferred in vitro to other bacterial genera has also been described, prompting concerns that polymyxin resistance could become more widespread. In a study from China, a plasmid gene associated with in vitro <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colistin-colistimethate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colistin</a> resistance (<em>mcr-1</em>) was first identified through surveillance of <em>E. coli</em> isolated from food animals, and in 2014, was identified in 16 of 1322 clinical isolates (1.2 percent) from hospitalized patients with Enterobacteriaceae infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymyxins-an-overview/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This resistance mechanism has subsequently been reported across the globe, including in a patient in the United States who had no travel history within the prior few months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymyxins-an-overview/abstract/21,25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,25-27</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2520106029\"><span class=\"h2\">Susceptibility testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no standardized methods for polymyxin susceptibility testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymyxins-an-overview/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The broth microdilution method, without surfactant, is preferred for susceptibility testing. E-testing correlates well with broth microdilution at low minimum inhibitory concentrations ([MIC] between 0.25 and 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL),</span> but less reliably at more extreme dilutions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymyxins-an-overview/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The disk diffusion method cannot be used to test for resistance since polymyxins diffuse poorly in agar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymyxins-an-overview/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Agar dilution and Vitek2 have also been used, but their reliability is unproven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymyxins-an-overview/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>].</p><p>For <em>P. aeruginosa</em> and <em>Acinetobacter</em> species, the breakpoints for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colistin-colistimethate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colistin</a> established by a joint working group from the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymyxins-an-overview/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MIC &le;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL:</span> Susceptible</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MIC &ge;4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL:</span> Resistant</p><p/><p>Breakpoints could not be established for Enterobacteriaceae, but for <em>E. coli</em>, <em>K. pneumoniae</em>, <em>Enterobacter cloacae</em>, and <em>Enterobacter aerogenes</em>, epidemiologic cut-off values were defined, with wild-type organisms having an MIC &le;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> and non-wild-type organisms having an MIC &ge;4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span>. </p><p>In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that any Enterobacteriaceae with an MIC to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colistin-colistimethate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colistin</a> &ge;4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> be submitted for <em>mcr-1</em> gene testing, either locally or through the state public health department [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymyxins-an-overview/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Given somewhat conflicting data (discussed below) and the lack of clear benefit in randomized trials, we do not routinely use inhaled colistin for gram-negative pneumonia, although they are a useful adjunct to systemic antibiotic therapy in select multidrug-resistant cases (particularly when polymyxins are being used for systemic therapy given their poor lung penetration). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults#H2783292273\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia in adults&quot;, section on 'Aerosolized antibiotics'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pseudomonas-aeruginosa-pneumonia#H1210512861\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia&quot;, section on 'Inhaled antibiotics'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acinetobacter-infection-treatment-and-prevention#H1211132\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acinetobacter infection: Treatment and prevention&quot;, section on 'Pneumonia'</a>.) </p><p>If inhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colistin-colistimethate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colistin</a> is used, it should be administered with caution. There is the concern that its use may select for resistance to colistin in organisms that are already widely resistant to other agents, and its effect on the long-term microbiology of intensive care units is unknown. In addition, the drug breakdown products can cause direct damage to lung tissue, leading to potentially serious and life-threatening side effects. This is particularly true for preparations diluted greater than 24 hours prior to use. If colistin is to be used for nebulized inhalation, it must be mixed <strong>immediately</strong> prior to administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymyxins-an-overview/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. The optimal dose of inhaled colistin is uncertain and ranges from 75 to 150 mg colistin base activity (2.25 to 4.5 million international units CMS) twice daily. We typically start at 150 mg twice daily. </p><p>Data evaluating the benefit of inhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colistin-colistimethate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colistin</a> in patients with pneumonia are overall mixed, with randomized trials not demonstrating improvements in clinical cure. In a randomized trial of 149 patients with gram-negative ventilator-associated pneumonia, inhaled colistin plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipenem-and-cilastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipenem</a> resulted in faster resolution of respiratory failure and faster microbial eradication than intravenous colistin plus imipenem, but clinical cure rates, intensive care unit stay, and mortality were comparable between the two groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymyxins-an-overview/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Another randomized trial compared inhaled colistin with inhaled saline in addition to intravenous antibiotics among 100 patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by either <em>A. baumannii</em> or <em>P. aeruginosa</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymyxins-an-overview/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Although inhaled colistin increased microbial eradication from the respiratory secretions, there was no difference in clinical outcomes, and inhaled colistin increased the rate of bronchospasm. In contrast, in a meta-analysis of nine observational studies, use of nebulized colistin in addition to intravenous colistin for multidrug-resistant hospital-acquired pneumonia was associated with higher cure rates and lower mortality compared with intravenous treatment only [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymyxins-an-overview/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3626020434\"><span class=\"h2\">Intrathecal administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intrathecal and intraventricular administration of either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polymyxin-b-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">polymyxin B</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colistin-colistimethate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colistin</a> have been employed for central nervous system infection due to multidrug-resistant gram-negative organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymyxins-an-overview/abstract/68-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-70</a>]. </p><p>The optimal dosing is uncertain given variable doses used in the literature.

In most cases, the renal failure was reversible; only one patient developed end stage renal disease. Older age, preexisting renal insufficiency, hypoalbuminemia, and concomitant use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are reported risk factors for colistin-induced nephrotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/polymyxins-an-overview/abstract/62,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,82</a>].
