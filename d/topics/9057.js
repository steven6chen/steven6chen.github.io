It is a common disorder whose prevalence rises markedly with increasing degrees of obesity. Treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus includes education, evaluation for microvascular and macrovascular complications, normalization of glycemia, minimization of cardiovascular and other long-term risk factors, and avoidance of drugs that can aggravate abnormalities of insulin or lipid metabolism. Weight reduction, diet, and oral medication (typically <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a>) can all be used to improve glycemic control, although the majority of patients with type 2 diabetes fail to maintain glycemic targets after a successful initial response to therapy. The therapeutic options for such patients include adding a second or third oral agent or an injectable agent, including insulin, or switching to insulin.</p><p>The role of insulin in achieving optimal glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes will be reviewed here. Options for initial therapy, options for the management of persistent hyperglycemia, and other therapeutic issues in diabetes management, such as the frequency of monitoring and evaluation for microvascular and macrovascular complications, are discussed separately.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of blood glucose in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-persistent-hyperglycemia-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of persistent hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-medical-care-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of medical care in adults with diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H955358\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal patterns of insulin secretion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Insulin is secreted in a pulsatile manner; pulses occur under basal (unstimulated) conditions and in response to meals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-therapy-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Basal insulin secretion represents approximately 50 percent of 24-hour insulin production, with the remainder accounted for by prandial (mealtime) excursions.</p><p>The term &quot;intensive insulin therapy&quot; has been used to describe complex regimens that separate basal insulin delivery (given as one to two daily injections of intermediate- or long-acting insulin) with superimposed doses of short- or rapid-acting insulins three or more times daily before meals to limit postprandial glycemic excursions. While intensive regimens were initially used for patients with type 1 diabetes, they are used for patients with type 2 diabetes as well.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Insulin preparations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In type 2 diabetes, insulin is generally provided in three ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As a basal supplement with an intermediate- to long-acting preparation (NPH, neutral protamine lispro [NPL], glargine, detemir, or the very-long-acting degludec) to suppress hepatic glucose production and maintain near normoglycemia in the fasting state</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As a premeal (prandial) bolus dose of short-acting (regular) or rapid-acting (lispro, aspart, glulisine) insulin to cover the extra requirements after food is absorbed</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As a premixed combination of intermediate-acting and short- or rapid-acting insulin</p><p/><p>The approximate time of onset, peak activity, and duration of action of the most commonly used insulins are reviewed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F73676\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73676 \">table 1</a>) and in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of insulin therapy in diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Insulin preparations'</a>.)</p><p>For many patients with type 2 diabetes, basal insulin alone is often adequate for good glycemic control as endogenous insulin secretion will control the postprandial excursions. Some patients with type 2 diabetes will require additional premeal boluses, similar to treatment for type 1 diabetes. For patients with type 2 diabetes who require prandial insulin, the goal is to adjust the dose of short- or rapid-acting insulin immediately prior to a meal, and therefore, we prefer to keep basal and premeal insulin injections separate and adjust them independently. Patients may draw up their premeal and basal insulins (except for glargine and detemir, which cannot be mixed with rapid-acting insulin) in the same syringe prior to injection.</p><p>Some insulins are commercially available in a premixed formulation. Most premixed (biphasic) preparations contain an intermediate-acting insulin and either a short- or a rapid-acting insulin, and some patients who require premeal insulin in addition to basal insulin prefer premixed insulins for convenience. Premixed insulin preparations are sometimes used in type 2 diabetes, but we almost never use them in patients with type 1 diabetes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of insulin therapy in diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Premixed insulins'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1919079\"><span class=\"h2\">Glycemic targets</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The importance of glycemic control in minimizing complications related to diabetes has been well established in type 1 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-therapy-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Similarly, the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) demonstrated that strict glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes results in a similar reduction in risk of microvascular disease as in type 1 diabetes (although the impact on prevention of macrovascular complications in type 2 diabetes remains uncertain) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F52273\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52273 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-therapy-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Based upon the results of the UKPDS, glycemic control as close to the normal range as safely possible, with a glycated hemoglobin (A1C) level &lt;7 percent for most patients, is now the goal for patients with type 2 diabetes. However, target A1C levels in patients with type 2 diabetes should be tailored to the individual, balancing the improvement in microvascular complications with the risk of hypoglycemia. The A1C goal should also be set somewhat higher for older patients and those with a limited life expectancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glycemic control and vascular complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Glycemic targets'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H952957\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for insulin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial treatment of type 2 diabetes should begin with diet, weight reduction, and exercise, which may achieve target A1C levels if compliance is optimal. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Metformin</a> therapy (in the absence of contraindications) may be initiated, concurrent with lifestyle intervention, at the time of diabetes diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of blood glucose in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Initial pharmacologic therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Persistent hyperglycemia on oral agents</strong> &ndash; Oral agents become less effective as beta cell function declines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F81706\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81706 \">figure 2</a>). The therapeutic options for patients who fail initial therapy with lifestyle intervention and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> are to add a second oral or injectable agent, including insulin, or to switch to insulin. There is no consensus on which option is most effective. However, insulin is the preferred second-line medication for patients with A1C &gt;8.5 percent or with symptoms of hyperglycemia despite metformin titration. Patients should be made aware that initiating insulin does not represent a personal &quot;failure&quot; and that most patients with type 2 diabetes will eventually require exogenous insulin, due to decline in endogenous insulin production. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-persistent-hyperglycemia-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of persistent hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Treatment options'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Initial therapy</strong> &ndash; Insulin, rather than oral hypoglycemic agents, may be indicated for initial treatment for some patients with type 2 diabetes, depending on the severity of the baseline metabolic disturbance.

The magnitude of the weight gain depends upon the intensity of regimen (dose and frequency of insulin) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-therapy-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, it is uncertain if the means of lowering the A1C (type of insulin) promotes weight gain independent of the lowering of the A1C.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the UKPDS, the average weight gain after 10 years of insulin therapy was about 7 kg for patients with type 2 diabetes, with the most rapid weight gain occurring when insulin was first initiated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-therapy-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Less intensive therapy with either insulin or a sulfonylurea (which increases endogenous insulin secretion) was associated with a 3.5 to 4.8 kg weight gain at three years versus no change with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> monotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-therapy-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In a subsequent trial, weight gain was greater with prandial than basal insulin (4.8 versus 3.1 kg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-therapy-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]; however, patients receiving prandial insulin also received a greater insulin dose, which could account for the small difference in weight gain. In other trials, premixed rapid-acting preparations were more often associated with weight gain than long-acting insulin or oral agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-therapy-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">It is not clear if the weight gain is clinically important, as microvascular complications were reduced with insulin monotherapy in the UKPDS despite weight gain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-therapy-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Whether weight gain with insulin might adversely affect risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in type 2 diabetes is not clear; however, in type 1 diabetes, intensive insulin therapy in Diabetes Control and Complications Trial <span class=\"nowrap\">(DCCT)/Epidemiology</span> of Diabetes Interventions and Complications (EDIC) resulted in weight gain but a major reduction in CVD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-therapy-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Nevertheless, patients initiating insulin therapy should be aware of the potential for weight gain, and major emphasis should be placed on lifestyle modification to prevent it. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of blood glucose in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Diabetes education'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypoglycemia</strong> &ndash; An increased risk of hypoglycemia is a potential complication of insulin therapy. However, patients with type 2 diabetes experience less hypoglycemia than patients with type 1 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-therapy-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Basal insulin is associated with less hypoglycemia than prandial insulin (see <a href=\"#H4142283563\" class=\"local\">'Choice of insulin'</a> below). Among basal insulin preparations, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-glargine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">insulin glargine</a>, detemir, and degludec may have some relatively modest clinical advantages over NPH (less symptomatic and nocturnal hypoglycemia) with the important disadvantage of high cost (see <a href=\"#H2032836723\" class=\"local\">'Basal insulin'</a> below). The management of hypoglycemia in patients with diabetes is reviewed in more detail separately.

The majority of the studies provide information on lowering of glycemia but do not provide information regarding the effects of various insulin regimens on microvascular or macrovascular complications or mortality. When differences in A1C levels have been found, they are often offset by adverse events (hypoglycemia, weight gain).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Initial regimen</strong> &ndash; Patients with persistent hyperglycemia despite oral hypoglycemic therapy may:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Add insulin to oral medication</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">or</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Stop the oral drug(s) and begin insulin</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The rationale for combination oral hypoglycemic drug and insulin therapy is that, by suppressing hepatic glucose production, the patient can retain the convenience of oral agents while minimizing total insulin requirements and weight gain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-therapy-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Metformin</a> is often continued with the addition of a second agent, including insulin. Other agents including sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors can also be continued when insulin is added, although the putative advantages of doing so may not merit the increased cost. Sulfonylureas are usually tapered and stopped, especially when preprandial insulin is started. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-persistent-hyperglycemia-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of persistent hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Combination oral and insulin therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients who are initiating insulin (in addition to oral agents, in place of oral agents, or as initial treatment), we suggest initiating basal rather than prandial insulin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F73793\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73793 \">algorithm 1</a>). Either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-nph-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">insulin NPH</a> or detemir given at bedtime, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-glargine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">insulin glargine</a> or degludec given in the morning or at bedtime, is a reasonable initial regimen. The choice of basal insulin is based upon availability, patient preference, and cost. Subsequent modifications can be made according to fasting blood glucose (FBG) and A1C values. Although basal and prandial insulin are similarly effective in improving A1C, basal insulin is associated with greater patient satisfaction and less frequent hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-therapy-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Initiation of insulin therapy with a basal insulin has the advantage of convenience and simplicity in patients who are using insulin for the first time. (See <a href=\"#H4142283563\" class=\"local\">'Choice of insulin'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Titrating dose</strong> &ndash; For patients with persistently elevated A1C levels who have FBG levels in the target range (70 to 130 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [3.9 to 7.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]),</span> we advise the patient to check fingerstick capillary glucose levels fasting, pre-lunch, pre-dinner, and before bed while the insulin regimen is further adjusted.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If pre-dinner glucose values are elevated, options include adding a breakfast dose of NPH or prandial insulin at lunchtime. If blood glucose values are elevated before lunch <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bed, we typically add prandial insulin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F73793\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73793 \">algorithm 1</a>). For patients with type 2 diabetes who require prandial insulin, either short- (regular) or rapid-acting insulin can be given. In this setting, oral agents other than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> are discontinued (in the absence of contraindications or intolerance, metformin can be continued). The choice of prandial insulin is based upon availability, patient preference, and cost. Most patients prefer rapid-acting insulin because of the ability to inject the rapid-acting insulins immediately before meals, as opposed to the 30 to 45 minutes before the meal recommended for short-acting insulins. (See <a href=\"#H5355588\" class=\"local\">'Basal bolus regimens'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients who require prandial insulin, we prefer to keep basal and prandial insulin injections separate and adjust them independently. From a practical point of view, adherence may be better for some patients using premixed insulins even though flexibility in adjusting doses is limited. (See <a href=\"#H953293\" class=\"local\">'Premixed insulin'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of insulin therapy in diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Premixed insulins'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H955351\"><span class=\"h1\">COMBINATION ORAL AGENT AND INSULIN THERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4142283563\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of insulin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When insulin is combined with oral agents, a basal (long- or intermediate-acting) rather than a short-acting, premeal (prandial) insulin is a reasonable first choice. The addition of basal insulin will improve nocturnal and fasting blood glucose (FBG), whereas prandial (premeal) bolus insulin will decrease postprandial glucose excursions. We prefer initiating basal insulin, rather than prandial insulin, in patients who are poorly controlled on oral agents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F73793\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73793 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>Both basal and premeal regimens are similarly effective in reducing A1C concentrations when insulin doses are aggressively titrated to achieve glycemic goals, but basal insulin is associated with less frequent hypoglycemia. Whether a basal or a prandial (premeal) bolus strategy is more effective in improving important diabetes endpoints (microvascular and macrovascular complications) remains uncertain.

This approach is cheaper than combined oral agent-insulin therapy (although generic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> is relatively inexpensive) but results in more weight gain and more episodes of hypoglycemia, few of which are severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-therapy-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

We advise the patient to check fingerstick capillary glucose levels fasting, pre-lunch, pre-dinner, and before bed while the regimen is being adjusted. Insulin doses should then be adjusted to achieve target levels of glycemia. Patients should reduce their insulin dose if hypoglycemia develops.

Daily insulin doses typically exceed 65 to 100 units per day and may sometimes be much higher before obese, type 2 diabetic patients can achieve near-normal glycemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5354953\"><span class=\"h3\">Twice-daily regimens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the goal is control of persistent hyperglycemia with a regimen that is simple and inexpensive, then twice-daily NPH insulin will be effective in many patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-therapy-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/24,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,57</a>]. The addition of a second dose of NPH at breakfast may be particularly helpful when pre-dinner blood glucoses are above goal. When the insulin preparation is detemir, serum insulin concentrations over a 24-hour period may also be more stable in patients taking two doses daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-therapy-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2032836723\" class=\"local\">'Basal insulin'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5355588\"><span class=\"h3\">Basal bolus regimens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with type 2 diabetes, basal insulin alone is often adequate for good glycemic control, but for others, prandial (premeal or preprandial) boluses are necessary, as they are in type 1 diabetes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of blood glucose in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Prandial insulin options'</a>.)</p><p>For patients with type 2 diabetes who require prandial insulin (typically, patients with pre-lunch <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pre-bedtime blood glucoses above goal), either short- (regular) or rapid-acting insulin can be given. The choice of prandial insulin is based upon availability, patient preference, and cost. Most patients prefer rapid-acting insulin because of the ability to inject the rapid-acting insulins immediately before meals, as opposed to the 30 to 45 minutes before the meal recommended for short-acting insulins. (See <a href=\"#H2838942406\" class=\"local\">'Prandial insulin'</a> above.)</p><p>For patients with type 2 diabetes who require prandial insulin, we suggest not using premixed insulin initially. The goal is to adjust the dose of short- or rapid-acting insulin immediately prior to a meal, and therefore, we prefer to keep basal and premeal insulin injections separate and adjust them independently. However, premixed insulin is a reasonable option for patients with type 2 diabetes who are doing well on a stable, fixed ratio. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-insulin-therapy-in-diabetes-mellitus#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of insulin therapy in diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Premixed insulins'</a>.)</p><p>If premeal bolus insulin needs to be added, the optimal dose depends upon many factors, including current and target blood glucose values, carbohydrate content of the meal, and activity. A typical starting dose is approximately 4 to 6 units (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F73793\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73793 \">algorithm 1</a>). The dose can be increased by 2 to 3 units every three days until the postprandial blood glucose target is achieved. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutritional-considerations-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutritional considerations in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Carbohydrate consistency'</a>.)</p><p>A more complex method for adjusting premeal insulin is to match insulin delivery to the anticipated glucose excursion with meals. With this approach (called carbohydrate counting), insulin-to-carbohydrate ratios are determined based upon an individual's usual insulin requirements and carbohydrate intake. A dose is then calculated that will control postprandial blood glucose excursions. Insulin-to-carbohydrate ratios can vary with the time of day and are affected by stress, illness, and variations in physical activity. These issues are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutritional-considerations-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutritional considerations in type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Advanced carbohydrate counting'</a>.)</p><p>Most patients require specific training in carbohydrate counting, which requires some arithmetical computations that some patients find difficult or burdensome. Furthermore, it is uncertain if there is a glycemic advantage to carbohydrate counting in patients with type 2 diabetes. As an example, in a 24-week, randomized trial in 277 adults with type 2 diabetes, there was no difference in A1C values when mealtime insulin adjustments were based upon a simple algorithm (according to previous weeks' blood glucose monitoring results) or carbohydrate counting, using an insulin-to-carbohydrate ratio for each meal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-therapy-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Thus, either method is acceptable, and patient preference can guide the choice of method for premeal dosing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5354986\"><span class=\"h3\">Intensive insulin regimens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If intensive insulin therapy is chosen in a patient with type 2 diabetes, the pretreatment considerations, choice of regimen, and management issues are similar to those for patients with type 1 diabetes. Insulin pump therapy is used infrequently in patients with type 2 diabetes, but it may have a role in a select group of patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes taking multiple daily injections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-therapy-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Intensive insulin therapy is reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of blood glucose in adults with type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Use of an intensive insulin regimen (similar to that used in type 1 diabetes) results in higher serum insulin concentrations and better glycemic control than that achieved with either an oral drug or conventional insulin therapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-therapy-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A potential problem is the weight gain (averaging 8.7 kg in one study) that can occur with intensive regimens that achieve near-normal glycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/insulin-therapy-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].
