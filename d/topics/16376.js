When people from developed countries go to these places, they sometimes get infections.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Travel itself can be a threat to your health. Flying, for example, can increase your risk of blood clots and other health problems.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you have an ongoing health problem, such as diabetes, it can be hard to find supplies or help if you get sick while you are away.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H384528931\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I keep from getting an infection when I travel?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you are planning to go to Asia, Africa, South America, or Eastern Europe, make an appointment at a travel clinic. The doctors and nurses there can help you prepare for your trip. Depending on your destination, you might need to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have 1 or more vaccines, weeks or months before you go. For example, if you are traveling to parts of Africa or South America, you might need to get a vaccine against yellow fever.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid ice, tap water, and certain foods or parts of foods that can carry germs. If you drink untreated water or eat certain foods, you might get an infection that causes diarrhea, vomiting, or other problems.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treat the water you drink, to make sure it has no germs that could cause infection. To get rid of germs, you can boil water for 3 minutes and then let it cool. Another way to get rid of germs is to take 2 quarts of water, add 2 drops of 5% bleach, and wait 30 minutes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use bug spray that has DEET or a chemical called picaridin. You should also wear clothes that protect you from insect bites. Plus, you should check yourself for insects and remove them if you find any. Insects can infect you with germs they carry when they bite or sting you.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take medicines before and during your trip that can prevent infections such as malaria.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wear shoes that cover your feet completely if you are anywhere that might have traces of dog or human waste in the sand or soil. This can happen in places that do not have good plumbing or that do not treat toilet water before dumping it. If you walk barefoot in places like these, you can get infected with worms.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H384528938\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I have a health condition, but I want to travel?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have an ongoing health problem, such as diabetes or heart disease, ask your doctor or nurse how to plan for your trip.</p><p>Many people with health concerns are able to travel without any problems. The key is to plan ahead, and to make sure you have all the medicines and supplies you might need. It's also important to bring a list of all the medicines you take, the doses, and why you take them.</p><p>Here are some examples of special needs people might have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some people with diabetes must carry pills, insulin, and syringes when they fly. They usually have a letter from their doctor explaining their needs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some people with lung or heart disease need extra oxygen when they fly. That's because the air on a plane that is in-flight tends to have less oxygen than the air on the ground. People who need oxygen on the plane must arrange it with the airline before they fly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some people with blood clotting problems or bad veins need to stand up and move around if they are on a long flight. Otherwise they can develop blood clots. They might also need to wear special stockings that improve blood flow in the legs.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H384528945\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I am pregnant and want to travel?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Travel is safe for most pregnant women. But women who have had problems during pregnancy, such as high blood pressure, should limit air travel. There are no known risks of air travel for an unborn baby.</p><p>During long flights, pregnant women should stretch and flex their legs. They should also stand up and move around when it is safe to do so. This can prevent blood clots from forming in the legs.</p><p>Some of the vaccines and medicines given to travelers are not safe for pregnant women. If you want to travel to a country where infection is a concern, ask your doctor or nurse if you can safely go there. For example, many experts recommend that:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnant women avoid travel to places where there is malaria</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women who are pregnant, or trying to get pregnant, avoid travel to places where there is Zika virus</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H384528952\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I think about when I travel?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you are going to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A sunny or warm place, make sure to wear sunblock and clothes that block the sun. Getting too much sun can lead to sunburns and increase the risk of skin cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mountains or a place at high altitude, ask your doctor how you can keep from getting sick</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A place with a lot of traffic, keep in mind that the rules of the road are often different in other countries. Be extra careful when driving or crossing the street.</p><p/><p>There is a tool available through Massachusetts General Hospital that lets you enter your age and where you plan to travel, then gives you tips.
