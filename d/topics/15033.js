The key features of RB are the pathologic findings of tan-pigmented macrophages (also known as smokers' macrophages) in the respiratory bronchioles, a patchy submucosal and peribronchiolar infiltrate of lymphocytes and histiocytes, and peribronchiolar fibrosis that extends into contiguous alveolar walls. (See <a href=\"#H92410985\" class=\"local\">'Histopathology'</a> below.)</p><p>Respiratory bronchiolitis-associated interstitial lung disease (RB-ILD) is defined by the presence of changes of RB as the sole pathologic finding in a current or former cigarette smoker with clinical evidence of interstitial lung disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-bronchiolitis-associated-interstitial-lung-disease/abstract/1-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-7</a>]. The degree to which fibrosis extends into the alveolar wall has sometimes been used to distinguish RB from RB-ILD, but most pathologists believe that the two processes cannot be distinguished on pathologic grounds alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-bronchiolitis-associated-interstitial-lung-disease/abstract/1,8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8-11</a>]. Thus, RB-ILD probably represents a subset of individuals with a more severe stage in the spectrum of RB and is much less common than RB. </p><p>RB is a common finding among smokers, but RB-ILD is uncommon. As an example, in a series of 79 smokers with spontaneous pneumothorax requiring surgical intervention, RB was found in 89 percent of the lung biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-bronchiolitis-associated-interstitial-lung-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Although the exact incidence of RB-ILD is not known, in a review of 168 lung biopsies performed for suspicion of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, 10 were RB-ILD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-bronchiolitis-associated-interstitial-lung-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H92410985\" class=\"local\">'Histopathology'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=idiopathic-interstitial-pneumonias-clinical-manifestations-and-pathology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Idiopathic interstitial pneumonias: Clinical manifestations and pathology&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H344100678\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The exact pathogenesis of RB-ILD is unknown, although almost all patients with RB-ILD are current or former cigarette smokers, suggesting a key etiologic role of cigarette smoking. The role of cigarette smoking is supported by the improvement in disease manifestations that often accompanies smoking cessation. In addition, radiologic studies suggest a relationship between the duration and intensity of cigarette smoking and the presence on chest radiographs of the small irregular opacities (so-called &quot;dirty lungs&quot;) associated with RB and RB-ILD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-bronchiolitis-associated-interstitial-lung-disease/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>]. </p><p>The pathogenesis of RB-ILD appears to differ from that of another idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), as fibroblast foci are not seen in RB-ILD, but are the hallmark of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP; the pathologic pattern associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis). On the other hand, desquamative interstitial pneumonitis (DIP), which is highly associated with cigarette smoking, has similar pathologic changes to RB-ILD and may share a common pathogenesis.

Patients typically present in their 30s and 40s with subacute symptoms of cough and dyspnea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F67993\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67993 \">figure 1</a>). Pneumothorax, hemoptysis, and acute respiratory failure are less common initial manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-bronchiolitis-associated-interstitial-lung-disease/abstract/12,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,18,19</a>].

Depending on the history of occupational or other exposures that might cause hypersensitivity pneumonitis, serum precipitin testing to appropriate antigens is performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-hypersensitivity-pneumonitis-extrinsic-allergic-alveolitis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (extrinsic allergic alveolitis)&quot;, section on 'Serum precipitins'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-natural-history-of-alpha-1-antitrypsin-deficiency#H1551012802\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and natural history of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency&quot;, section on 'Evaluation and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H344100865\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary function tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are obtained to ascertain the pattern and magnitude of ventilatory impairment. The most common PFT finding in RB-ILD is a mixed obstructive-restrictive pattern with a slightly reduced diffusing capacity. The mixture of obstructive and restrictive patterns is attributed to the airway inflammation from heavy cigarette smoke exposure, which causes obstructive physiology, and the interstitial disease associated with RB-ILD, which causes restriction and a gas transfer abnormality. Occasionally, an isolated increase in residual volume (ie, mild air trapping) is noted. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pulmonary function testing in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Few studies of gas exchange in RB-ILD have been reported. In a series of 10 patients with RB-ILD, the diffusing capacity (DLCO) was moderately reduced (mean 57 percent of predicted) in eight patients in association with abnormalities in spirometry or lung volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-bronchiolitis-associated-interstitial-lung-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. One patient had a reduced DLCO without other PFT abnormalities and one had completely normal PFTs.

The chest radiograph in RB-ILD often demonstrates diffuse, fine reticular or nodular opacities with preserved lung volumes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F59288\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59288 \">image 1</a>), although the plain radiograph is normal in up to 28 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-bronchiolitis-associated-interstitial-lung-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Bronchial wall thickening, prominence of the peribronchovascular markings, small regular and irregular opacities, and small peripheral ring shadows are other common features of RB-ILD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-bronchiolitis-associated-interstitial-lung-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

In a series of 21 patients, HRCT findings included central bronchial wall thickening (90 percent), peripheral bronchial wall thickening (86 percent), centrilobular nodules (71 percent), and ground-glass opacity (67 percent). Centrilobular emphysema has been reported in 57 percent, usually in the upper lung zones; septal lines and a reticular pattern were noted in 33 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-bronchiolitis-associated-interstitial-lung-disease/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Atelectasis, intralobular and interlobular septal thickening, and peripheral blebs have been reported less commonly. Ground-glass nodules may be seen on HRCT scans of asymptomatic smokers due to RB, so this finding does not necessarily imply RB-ILD in the absence of symptomatic or physiologic impairment. These HRCT patterns can also be seen in other interstitial lung diseases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-resolution-computed-tomography-of-the-lungs#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High resolution computed tomography of the lungs&quot;, section on 'HRCT patterns'</a> and <a href=\"#H4295665\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The correlations between HRCT and histopathologic findings in RB-ILD have been examined. As an example, in a study of cigarette smokers undergoing lung resection for various pulmonary conditions, preoperative features on HRCT scans were correlated with histological abnormalities of the small airways and parenchyma in the surgical lung specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-bronchiolitis-associated-interstitial-lung-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Parenchymal micronodules on the preoperative CT scan correlated with the histopathological presence of bronchiolectasis and peribronchiolar fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-bronchiolitis-associated-interstitial-lung-disease/abstract/24,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,28</a>]. Areas of ground-glass attenuation were noted on CT scans from 11 patients and were related to three different histopathologic features:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The accumulation of pigmented macrophages and mucus in the alveolar spaces, associated with mild interstitial inflammation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fibrosis (64 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thickening of the alveolar walls with inflammatory cells, but normal alveolar spaces (27 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of an organizing alveolitis (9 percent)</p><p/><p>In a separate study of 21 patients with RB-ILD, the extent of ground-glass opacity correlated with the amount of macrophage accumulation in the alveoli and alveolar ducts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-bronchiolitis-associated-interstitial-lung-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H344100884\"><span class=\"h2\">Bronchoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is typically performed in the setting of diagnostic uncertainty, more extensive disease, or progressive disease despite smoking cessation. The main purpose is to exclude other processes in the differential, as the BAL findings of RB-ILD are nonspecific. (See <a href=\"#H4295665\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.) </p><p>BAL specimens are obtained from areas of radiographic abnormality and sent for total and differential cell counts, microbiologic studies, and cytology. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-and-technique-of-bronchoalveolar-lavage#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles and technique of bronchoalveolar lavage&quot;, section on 'Cell counting'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-bronchoalveolar-lavage-in-diagnosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of bronchoalveolar lavage in diagnosis of interstitial lung disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The BAL in patients with RB-ILD shows similar cell counts to those of healthy cigarette smokers, such as an increased number of macrophages, and proportionately lower percentages of other cellular constituents. Neutrophilia and eosinophilia in the BAL fluid are rare in RB-ILD and should prompt consideration of other types of interstitial pneumonia, such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis.</p><p>Transbronchial biopsy is obtained during bronchoscopy when technically feasible. As with BAL, the main purpose is to exclude other diseases. (See <a href=\"#H4295665\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.) A larger biopsy sample, than can be obtained with transbronchial biopsy, is needed to confirm a diagnosis of RB-ILD. Tissue samples are sent for histopathologic and microbiologic analysis.

If the diagnosis is strongly suspected based on clinical features, pulmonary function test results and imaging studies, a trial of smoking cessation may precede lung biopsy. Surgical lung biopsy is typically obtained when the diagnosis remains unclear after the above studies and the patient has moderate to severe respiratory impairment or does not improve following smoking cessation. The main role for lung biopsy is to exclude other interstitial lung diseases, while providing corroborative evidence of RB-ILD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-bronchiolitis-associated-interstitial-lung-disease/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].

Ideally, samples are obtained from more than one lobe, targeting areas of varying severity of radiographic disease, as determined by high resolution computed tomography.

These intraluminal macrophages are accompanied by a patchy submucosal and peribronchiolar infiltrate of lymphocytes and histiocytes. The interstitial histiocytes may contain dusty brown cytoplasmic pigment identical to that seen within the intraluminal macrophages, or they may contain coarse black anthracotic pigment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-bronchiolitis-associated-interstitial-lung-disease/abstract/6,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,32</a>]. The bronchioles may be ectatic and mucus filled. Peribronchiolar fibrosis expands in a stellate fashion into contiguous alveolar septa, which are lined by hyperplastic type 2 cells and cuboidal bronchiolar-type epithelium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57687\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57687 \">picture 1</a>). The changes are patchy at low magnification and have a bronchiolocentric distribution. The pulmonary parenchyma away from the airway is usually normal or may demonstrate mild hyperinflation.

Like RB-ILD, RB is characterized by accumulation of tan or golden pigmented, &quot;smoker's&quot; macrophages in the bronchiolar lumens and also chronic inflammation and fibrosis in membranous and respiratory bronchioles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-bronchiolitis-associated-interstitial-lung-disease/abstract/8,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,31</a>]. Variable, but generally mild fibrosis is described in the adjacent alveolar walls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-bronchiolitis-associated-interstitial-lung-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The lesions seen in RB-ILD may be more pronounced than the mainly mild clusters of brown pigmented macrophages in respiratory and membranous bronchioles in otherwise healthy cigarette smokers with RB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-bronchiolitis-associated-interstitial-lung-disease/abstract/6,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9</a>]. The more extensive the alveolar wall fibrosis, the more likely that the patient has RB-ILD than RB, although the pathologic changes require compatible clinical manifestations for confirmation of RB-ILD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-bronchiolitis-associated-interstitial-lung-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>One challenge for the pathologist is to differentiate RB-ILD from desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP), another form of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia that is strongly associated with cigarette smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-bronchiolitis-associated-interstitial-lung-disease/abstract/2,6,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,12</a>]. DIP is characterized by a prominent and diffuse accumulation of intraalveolar macrophages (that may show fine granular positivity with iron stains), hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes, and mild interstitial chronic inflammation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F59081\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59081 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F58789\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58789 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-bronchiolitis-associated-interstitial-lung-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. A semiquantitative histological evaluation comparing RB-ILD to DIP disclosed significantly more lymphoid follicles, interstitial fibrosis, and eosinophils in DIP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/respiratory-bronchiolitis-associated-interstitial-lung-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].
