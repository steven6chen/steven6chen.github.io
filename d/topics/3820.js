The majority of affected persons are asymptomatic, and thus provide an ongoing reservoir for infection. In infants born to mothers through an infected birth canal, conjunctivitis and pneumonia can occur. Moreover, both men and women can experience clinical syndromes due to infection at common epithelial sites, including the rectum and conjunctivae. Other types of <em>C. trachomatis</em> infection, including lymphogranuloma venereum and endemic trachoma, an ocular infection spread by direct contact and seen commonly in the developing world, may occur in both men and women.</p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of <em>C. trachomatis</em> in women and men are discussed below. The epidemiology and treatment of <em>C. trachomatis</em> as well as neonatal <em>C. trachomatis</em> infection, lymphogranuloma venereum, and endemic trachoma are discussed in detail elsewhere.

Untreated, cervical infection can ascend to cause pelvic inflammatory disease and its sequelae of infertility and chronic pain. Pregnant women with genital chlamydial infection are also at high risk for complications.</p><p>In addition, the presence of cervical ectopy (namely, the presence of columnar epithelium on the outer surface of the cervix in addition to in the endocervical canal) has been epidemiologically associated with an increased risk of detection of chlamydial infection. Some investigators have reported a link between infection and subsequent risk of cervical neoplasia; the extent of this potential effect at the population level is not known [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22688570\"><span class=\"h3\">Cervicitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority (at least 85 percent) of women infected at the cervix have neither signs nor symptoms, which is the rationale for routine annual screening of young sexually active women. As an example, in a multinational study of high-risk women who were screened for genital chlamydial infection with polymerase chain reaction testing of vaginal swabs, four of five sites recorded symptoms in only 6 to 14 percent of those who developed a new infection within the first year of testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. When symptoms do occur, they are highly nonspecific, and can easily be confused with vaginitis or endometrial pathology: a change in vaginal discharge, intermenstrual vaginal bleeding, and post-coital bleeding. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-cervicitis#H112758544\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute cervicitis&quot;, section on 'Signs and symptoms'</a>.)</p><p>Similarly, abnormal exam findings are found in the minority of women with genital chlamydial infection, approximately 10 to 20 percent in some studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. When signs are present, they include classic findings of cervicitis: mucopurulent endocervical discharge (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F67848\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67848 \">picture 1</a>), easily induced endocervical bleeding, or edematous ectopy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F84032\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef84032 \">picture 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-cervicitis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute cervicitis&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p>The incubation period of symptomatic disease generally ranges from 7 to 14 days following infection. However, it is unclear how long those with asymptomatic disease may carry the infection. In a systematic review of ten studies of untreated, uncomplicated genital chlamydial infections, detection of chlamydia persisted over the short term (weeks to months after diagnosis) in 56 to 89 percent, and for at least one year in 46 to 57 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, these studies did not record infection date nor did they evaluate for reinfection as opposed to persistent infection, thus limiting the understanding of duration of untreated chlamydial infection. Nevertheless, despite the possibility of spontaneous resolution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], all women diagnosed with chlamydia should be treated to prevent further complications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of Chlamydia trachomatis infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9967056\"><span class=\"h3\">Dysuria-pyuria syndrome due to urethritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chlamydial infection of the female urethra typically occurs in a relatively small proportion (approximately 25 percent) of women with cervical infection. Most of these women do not report symptoms specific to the urethral tract, but some complain of typical symptoms of a urinary tract infection (UTI) such as frequency and dysuria. Urinalysis reveals pyuria, but no organisms are seen on Gram stain or in bacterial culture. This combination of pyuria but no bacteriuria in a young, sexually active woman should prompt strong suspicion for chlamydial infection of the urethra. The differential diagnosis for such a presentation includes low-colony count urinary tract infection (eg, infection caused by <em>Staphylococcus saprophyticus</em>) that is not reported on culture or identified on urinalysis, or urethritis due to other sexually transmitted disease organisms, such as <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> or herpes simplex virus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sampling-and-evaluation-of-voided-urine-in-the-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sampling and evaluation of voided urine in the diagnosis of urinary tract infection in adults&quot;, section on 'Sterile pyuria'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22688584\"><span class=\"h3\">Pelvic inflammatory disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>C. trachomatis</em> can ascend to the upper reproductive tract, where pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) can result. In some studies of women presenting to sexually transmitted disease clinics, 2 to 4.5 percent developed clinical PID in the two weeks between diagnosis of chlamydia infection and follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. One small study of 20 women with <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> and <em>C. trachomatis</em> coinfection who were given antibiotics that were ineffective against chlamydia found a 30 percent incidence of PID after seven weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In contrast, studies of lower risk women have found no cases of clinical PID after a year of untreated chlamydial infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. These studies likely underestimate the incidence of PID in chlamydial infection, as many cases of PID may cause no symptoms and only be suspected years later in the setting of tubal infertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>When symptoms of PID are present, abdominal or pelvic pain are the most common, and their presence in the setting of cervicitis or a diagnosis of chlamydial infection should prompt strong suspicion for upper genital tract involvement. Signs of PID include cervical motion and uterine or adnexal tenderness. PID due to <em>C. trachomatis</em> is associated with higher rates of subsequent tubal infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain when compared with PID caused by gonorrhea, which typically causes a more acute symptomatic presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].

Perihepatitis is more commonly seen in the setting of actual PID, occurring in 5 to up to 15 percent of cases. It is associated with right-upper quadrant pain or pleuritic pain, but there are typically no liver enzyme abnormalities. The pathogenesis of this entity is not fully understood but may involve either direct extension of infected material from the cul-de-sac through the peritoneum <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lymphatics, or an immunologically mediated mechanism.

Among 3913 pregnant Dutch women who were screened for <em>C. trachomatis</em>, the risk of delivery prior to 32 weeks gestation was higher in those with chlamydial infection than in those without (adjusted OR 4.35, 95% CI 1.3-15.2). Miscarriage and perinatal death were not associated with chlamydial infection. The risk of transmission to the newborn is discussed elsewhere.

This is in contrast to the proctitis caused by the LGV serovars (L1, L2, L3), which almost exclusively affect men who have sex with men.

The proportion of cases that are asymptomatic vary by population and range from 40 to 96 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/5,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,19,20</a>]. When men do have symptoms, they typically present with a mucoid or watery urethral discharge, and dysuria is often a prominent complaint. The discharge is often clear and only seen upon milking the urethra [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Sometimes the discharge is so scant that men only notice stained undergarments in the morning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The Gram stain of urethral discharge generally shows more than two leukocytes per high powered field (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F56547\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56547 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], although this finding is not seen in up to a third of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The incubation period is variable but is typically 5 to 10 days after exposure. This is in contrast to the more copious and purulent urethral discharge and shorter (two to seven days) incubation period for gonococcal urethritis. However, these syndromes frequently overlap and cannot reliably be distinguished on clinical grounds only.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22688635\"><span class=\"h3\">Epididymitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>C. trachomatis</em> is one of the most frequent pathogens in epididymitis among sexually active men &lt;35 years of age, along with <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em>. Men with acute epididymitis typically have unilateral testicular pain and tenderness, hydrocele, and palpable swelling of the epididymis. Occasionally, <em>C. trachomatis</em> infection can be misdiagnosed as a testicular malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Some studies have shown that men with chronic prostatitis without a clear bacterial etiology had detectable chlamydial antigen in urine or prostatic secretions more frequently than men with pelvic pain but no signs of prostatic inflammation (21 to 25 versus 0 to 6 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. Symptoms in these men included dysuria, urinary dysfunction, pain with ejaculation, and pelvic pain. By definition, their expressed prostatic secretions demonstrated an elevated number of leukocytes on microscopy. These findings are similar to those in chronic bacterial prostatitis.

In this group, infection is not uncommon and can be caused by D-K and L serovars [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In a study of over 10,000 MSM who presented to a sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinic, 14 percent tested positive for rectal <em>C. trachomatis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. However, anal intercourse is not uncommon among heterosexuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], and symptomatic proctitis has also been reported in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The clinical presentation of chlamydial proctitis depends on the infecting chlamydial serovars.</p><p>The L1, L2 and L3 serovars of <em>C. trachomatis</em> cause the disease known as lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), which can present as anorectal disease and has been reported in outbreaks among European and North American MSM, particularly those who are HIV-infected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. Symptoms occur in the vast majority of cases. These include anorectal pain, discharge, tenesmus, rectal bleeding and constipation, with widely variant frequencies reported in case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Systemic symptoms of fever and malaise are also often present. Anoscopic findings are nonspecific, but include mucosal friability, internal lesions, masses or polyps, and mucopurulent exudate. The presentation can be mistaken for inflammatory bowel disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. Left untreated, rectal infection with the L1, L2, and L3 serovars can lead to rectal fistulae and strictures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lymphogranuloma-venereum\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lymphogranuloma venereum&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The non-LGV serovars that cause genital infection (serovars D through K) can also cause infection of the rectum, particularly in MSM, but in contrast to LGV, these infections are usually asymptomatic. As an example, in a study that screened MSM for rectal chlamydial infection, only 49 of 301 cases (16 percent) of non-LGV infection were symptomatic compared with 58 of 62 cases (95 percent) of rectal LGV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Routine annual screening of this site (or more frequently, in those at ongoing risk) is recommended for MSM, particularly in the HIV-infected person [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22688657\"><span class=\"h2\">Reactive arthritis/reactive arthritis triad (RAT)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 1 percent of men with urethritis develop reactive arthritis, and approximately one-third of these patients have the complete reactive arthritis triad (RAT) formerly referred to as Reiter syndrome (arthritis, uveitis, and urethritis). <em>C. trachomatis</em> appears to be the most common inciting pathogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. The association between chlamydia and reactive arthritis has been further suggested by techniques that can detect chlamydial nucleic acids in synovial tissue. As an example, seven of nine patients with RAT had a positive in situ hybridization test for chlamydial RNA from samples of synovial tissue compared with 3 of 13 patients without RAT (the cause of the arthritis in these three patients was not otherwise defined) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

If NAAT methods are unavailable, antigen detection and genetic probe methods can be applied to endocervical or urethral swabs to diagnose chlamydia. In resource-limited settings, rapid tests for chlamydia may be used for diagnosis, if available. When no specific diagnostic tests are available, the presumptive diagnosis of chlamydia is made when symptoms and signs of the clinical syndromes associated with chlamydia are present in young or sexually active patients.</p><p>Rectal chlamydial infection in persons who engage in receptive anal intercourse can be diagnosed by testing a rectal swab specimen. Many laboratories, including commercial laboratories, have met testing validation requirements for NAAT testing of rectal specimens under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA) regulations. Although serology is useful in the diagnosis of classic LGV, its performance in the setting of LGV proctitis is suboptimal, and it is not recommended. Clinicians who suspect LGV proctitis should seek expert advice from local public health authorities and infectious disease specialists on how to diagnose the condition effectively. Often, this is not possible and empiric therapy is warranted.

Because of superior sensitivity and specificity, NAAT is the diagnostic technique of choice, where available. With this technique, noninvasive screening options, such as first-catch urine testing or self-collected vaginal swabs, are possible and have become the diagnostic approach of choice for chlamydial (and gonococcal) infections. However, for women presenting with symptomatic cervicitis who undergo a speculum exam, or for high-risk women undergoing routine Pap smear, NAAT can be performed on either endocervical or vaginal swabs.</p><p>Swabs should have a plastic or wire shaft and a rayon, dacron, or cytobrush tip, as other materials may be inhibitory to the organism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infections/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22688685\"><span class=\"h3\">Nucleic acid amplification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NAAT methodology consists of amplifying <em>C. trachomatis</em> DNA or RNA sequences using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), transcription-mediated amplification (TMA), or strand displacement amplification (SDA).

First-catch urine submitted for NAAT should be collected from the initial stream (approximately the first 10 mL) without pre-cleansing of the genital areas.
