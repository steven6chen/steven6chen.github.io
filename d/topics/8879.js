De novo IBC refers to primary disease. These patients typically present with pain and a tender, firm, and enlarged breast. The skin over the breast is reddened, warm, and thickened, with a &quot;peau d'orange&quot; (orange skin) appearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F70894\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70894 \">picture 1</a>). In comparison, the inflammatory recurrence of a noninflammatory breast cancer is called secondary disease. It usually develops on the chest wall at the site of previous mastectomy, but can also occur rarely as a distant cutaneous recurrence. The signs and symptoms of IBC arise rapidly compared to non IBC, typically within weeks to six months.</p><p>Primary IBC is a relatively rare disorder accounting for approximately 1 to 5 percent of invasive breast cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammatory-breast-cancer-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. However, because of its aggressive nature, it accounts for a greater proportion of cases presenting with more advanced disease. In one report of 752 patients with stage III breast cancer, for example, 24 percent had IBC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammatory-breast-cancer-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>At presentation, almost all women with primary IBC have lymph node involvement and approximately one-third have distant metastases. The long-term prognosis is also relatively poor, which has led to the development of combined modality treatment regimens consisting of neoadjuvant chemotherapy to maximize clinical response, followed by locoregional treatment, and then consolidation chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammatory-breast-cancer-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inflammatory-breast-cancer-clinical-features-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inflammatory breast cancer: Clinical features and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BASIC FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The 2017 American Joint Committee on Cancer and the International Union for Cancer Control (AJCC-UICC) Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) breast cancer staging system defines inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) as a clinical-pathologic entity characterized by diffuse erythema and edema (peau d'orange) involving a third or more of the skin of the breast (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110848\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110848 \">table 1</a>). These &quot;inflammatory&quot; skin changes are not due to infiltration of inflammatory cells but rather to lymphedema caused by tumor emboli within the dermal lymphatics. However, the diagnosis is based upon the clinical presentation. Although dermal lymphatic involvement supports the diagnosis of inflammatory breast cancer, it is neither necessary nor sufficient in the absence of classical clinical findings. </p><p>IBC is designated as primary tumor stage T4d. Tumor presentation with ulceration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ipsilateral satellite skin nodules <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> edema are T4b. Not all skin changes qualify as IBC or even locally advanced breast cancer (LABC). Invasion of the dermis alone, such as dimpling of the skin or nipple retraction does not qualify as T4 and may occur in T1, T2, or T3 without changing the classification. </p><p>Of note, if a cancer is designated as inflammatory before therapy, the patient will be designated to have inflammatory breast cancer throughout, even if the patient has complete resolution of inflammatory findings.</p><p>Primary IBC has several characteristic biologic features:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is rapidly progressive</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is highly angiogenic and angioinvasive; these features account for the high metastatic potential</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The aggressive behavior and angiogenicity are intrinsic features of the tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammatory-breast-cancer-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]</p><p/><p>The last characteristic was demonstrated in a unique human xenograft model, the scid (severe combined immune deficiency) mouse. Implantation of noninflammatory human tumors into the mammary fat pad in these mice resulted in the growth of isolated subcutaneous nodules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammatory-breast-cancer-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In contrast, implantation of an IBC resulted in exclusive growth within lymphatic and blood vessels, with marked erythema of the overlying skin.</p><p>Given these data, an international expert panel proposed the following consensus-based criteria for the diagnosis of IBC in 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammatory-breast-cancer-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapid onset of breast erythema, edema <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> peau d&rsquo;orange, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> warm breast, with or without an underlying palpable mass</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duration of history no more than six months</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Erythema occupying at least one-third of the breast</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pathologic confirmation of invasive carcinoma</p><p/><p>Primary IBC refers to a de novo IBC. Secondary IBC is the inflammatory recurrence of a noninflammatory primary breast carcinoma. Secondary IBC usually occurs on the chest wall at the site of previous mastectomy for a noninflammatory breast cancer, but occasionally may be found at a distant cutaneous recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammatory-breast-cancer-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classic histologic finding in IBC on biopsy of affected skin is dermal lymphatic invasion by tumor cells; this change can also be seen in areas of skin that are clinically normal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F60801\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60801 \">picture 2</a>). These malignant cells form tumor emboli, which are responsible for both the local signs and symptoms and for the development of metastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammatory-breast-cancer-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Thus, the term &quot;inflammatory&quot; breast cancer is actually a misnomer since the clinical signs suggesting inflammation are not due to infiltration of inflammatory cells. Invasion of the dermis outside the lymphatics is uncommon in primary IBC but can be seen in secondary IBC.</p><p>Several caveats need to be kept in mind when evaluating the skin biopsy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dermal lymphatic invasion is not always found in patients with primary IBC, primarily due to sampling error.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dermal lymphatic invasion can be an incidental finding in patients with breast cancer who do not have clinical evidence of IBC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammatory-breast-cancer-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]; such tumors are not considered to be inflammatory cancers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rarely, women with clinical features suggestive of IBC have other disorders; these include acute mastitis, diffuse infiltration by lymphoma or leukemia cells, and advanced noninflammatory breast cancer.</p><p/><p>Primary IBC is not a specific histologic subtype of breast cancer, but the tumor is often of the ductal type. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of breast cancer&quot;</a>.) These tumors generally have a high histologic grade, with pleomorphic tumor cells, highly atypical mitotic figures, and a high intratumoral microvessel density [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammatory-breast-cancer-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/9,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13</a>]. It has been suggested that secondary IBC is more likely to be seen in recurrences of primary breast cancers with prominent apocrine features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammatory-breast-cancer-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MOLECULAR GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, the angioinvasive nature of primary IBC appears to be intrinsic to the tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammatory-breast-cancer-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/6,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,14</a>]. Experimental studies have begun to shed light on the pathogenetic factors that may be involved in the development and progression of this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammatory-breast-cancer-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Among the factors that have been evaluated are hormone receptor status, the p53 tumor suppressor gene, other genetic determinants, and cytokines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Hormonal receptors and other tumor markers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breast cancers that do not express estrogen or progesterone receptors (ER and PgR) are generally associated with a shorter disease-free survival and a worse prognosis than receptor-positive tumors. The majority of IBCs are hormone receptor-negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammatory-breast-cancer-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/6,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,15-17</a>]. In one report of 60 patients with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) of any type, both response to treatment and overall survival were significantly correlated with ER and PgR positivity as well as a lower mitotic index, histologic grade, and diploid tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammatory-breast-cancer-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognostic-and-predictive-factors-in-early-nonmetastatic-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognostic and predictive factors in early, nonmetastatic breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>IBCs are also characterized by a high proliferative rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammatory-breast-cancer-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Approximately 60 percent of IBCs overexpress the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and the type EGFR, also called HER2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammatory-breast-cancer-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Although not specific for IBC, these molecular markers may identify patients who have a worse prognosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is detected in approximately one-half of IBCs, and the most frequently lost alleles are at 3p, 6p, 8p, 11q, 13q, and 17q [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammatory-breast-cancer-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Lack of expression of genes at some of these loci may have phenotypic and prognostic importance. As an example, in one series of 64 patients with IBC who were treated homogeneously at a single institution between 1988 and 1999, women who presented with extensive inflammation and who had a poor overall outcome had both a significantly higher overall frequency and a different pattern of intratumoral LOH compared to those who presented with localized inflammation and who had a better prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammatory-breast-cancer-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">p53 tumor suppressor gene</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene or accumulation of p53 protein have been reported in 20 to 50 percent of human breast cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammatory-breast-cancer-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. These abnormalities are more often seen in patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">familial/hereditary</span> breast cancer syndromes (such as the familial breast and ovarian cancer and Li-Fraumeni syndromes) than in those with sporadic breast cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=li-fraumeni-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Li-Fraumeni syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The p53 status in IBC was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in a series of 27 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammatory-breast-cancer-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Three groups of almost equal size were identified: tumors with high levels of p53 in the nucleus, tumors with no detectable p53, and tumors with p53 in the cytoplasm. The last two groups had only wild-type p53, while the samples with intense nuclear staining had a variety of missense mutations. These findings suggest that two mechanisms, direct mutation and cytoplasmic sequestration of wild-type protein, can subvert the normal role of p53 in IBCs.</p><p>A subsequent study by the same group evaluated 24 additional patients with IBC in an attempt to determine the prognostic significance of p53 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammatory-breast-cancer-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Those patients with a p53 gene mutation and nuclear overexpression of p53 protein had an 8.6-fold higher risk of death compared with patients that had neither mutation nor protein overexpression. There was an important prognostic interaction with ER expression. The subset of patients who were both ER-negative and had nuclear p53 overexpression had a 17.9-fold higher risk of death, compared to 2.8-fold for women with tumors that had p53 nuclear overexpression alone.</p><p>Similar findings were noted in a study of 39 LABCs, 32 of which were confirmed as IBCs by clinical and pathologic criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammatory-breast-cancer-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. p53 mutations were detected in 41 percent of the tumors analyzed, all but three of which had intense p53 nuclear staining. The presence of p53 mutations was significantly associated with large tumor size and disseminated disease at diagnosis. There was also a nonsignificant trend toward an association between p53 mutation, negative ER status and a lower rate of response to therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">RhoC GTPase and WISP3</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In an effort to identify new genes that may contribute to the rapidly growing and metastatic features of IBCs, we compared the genes expressed in two cells lines: an IBC cell line (SUM149) and two human mammary epithelial (HME) cell lines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammatory-breast-cancer-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Seventeen transcripts were identified as being differentially expressed, eight solely by the normal cell lines, and nine solely by the tumor cell line. This was followed by a blinded analysis of the seventeen transcripts in 20 archival IBCs and 30 stage-matched non-IBCs. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two genes, RhoC GTPase and a novel gene called WISP3 or LIBC (lost in inflammatory breast cancer), were concordantly altered in 91 percent of the IBC specimens compared to none of the controls.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The putative RhoC GTPase oncogene was more often overexpressed (90 versus 38 percent) and WISP3 was commonly lost in the IBCs (80 versus 21 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Role of RhoC GTPase &ndash; RhoC GTPase is a member of the Ras superfamily of small GTP-binding proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammatory-breast-cancer-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. It is involved in cytoskeletal reorganization, via regulation of the actin cytoskeleton [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammatory-breast-cancer-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Transfection of the RhoC GTPase gene into human mammary epithelial cells leads to enhanced invasiveness, motility, and the release of angiogenic cytokines (eg, vascular endothelial growth factor), at least partially recapitulating the IBC phenotype (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Cytokines'</a> below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammatory-breast-cancer-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. The additional observation that overexpression of RhoC GTPase correlates with tumor progression in aggressive ductal pancreatic cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammatory-breast-cancer-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>] is consistent with the hypothesis that RhoC GTPase is an important contributor to the IBC metastatic phenotype.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Role of WISP3 &ndash; The product of the WISP3 gene is an insulin-like growth factor binding protein-related protein (IGFBP-rP) called IGFBPrP-9 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammatory-breast-cancer-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. It has been suggested that both the high-affinity IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs) and the IGFBPrPs modulate the availability of insulin-like growth factor to the cell surface IGF receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammatory-breast-cancer-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. If so, they could potentiate IGF-mediated proliferative actions; they may also promote tumor cell growth by IGF-independent effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammatory-breast-cancer-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p/><p>There is suggestive evidence that at least some IGFBPrPs play a role in tumor progression. Downregulation or loss of IGFBPrP-1 expression has been associated with progression of breast cancer and prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammatory-breast-cancer-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>], while transfection of WISP3 into breast cancer cells inhibits tumor cell growth, invasiveness, and angiogenic potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammatory-breast-cancer-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Thus, the WISP3 gene appears to act as a tumor suppressor gene in breast cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Cytokines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, the term inflammatory is a misnomer in IBC since the clinical signs suggesting inflammation are due to tumor cell invasion of dermal lymphatics, not infiltration of inflammatory cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammatory-breast-cancer-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In addition, IBCs produce negligible levels of most inflammatory cytokines such as interferon-gamma, interleukin-1 (IL)-1, and IL-12.</p><p>However, other cytokines may be important. As mentioned above, IBCs tend to be highly vascular tumors because of their angiogenic and angioinvasive potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammatory-breast-cancer-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In preclinical models, IBC tumor cell lines and tumor specimens release increased amounts of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, FGF-2), IL-6, and IL-8; increased release of these cytokines also occurs in human mammary epithelial cells that are transfected with and overexpress the RhoC GTPase gene, a gene specifically associated with IBC (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'RhoC GTPase and WISP3'</a> above) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammatory-breast-cancer-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>The VEGF receptor-3 (VEGFR-3) is expressed in the lymphatic endothelium, plays an important role in lymphatic development, and is activated after binding to VEGF-C and VEGF-D. The VEGFR-3 pathway also may play an important role in tumor lymphangiogenesis and subsequent metastasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammatory-breast-cancer-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. As an example, VEGF-C is overexpressed in some breast cancer cells, promoting both intratumoral lymphangiogenesis and metastases to the regional lymph nodes and lungs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammatory-breast-cancer-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In contrast, VEGF ligands to VEGFR-2 do not stimulate lymphangiogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammatory-breast-cancer-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-peripheral-lymphedema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of peripheral lymphedema&quot;</a>.)</p><p>These observations appear to be applicable to human disease. One study screened breast cancer cell lines for expression of members of the VEGF family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inflammatory-breast-cancer-pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expression of VEGF-A and VEGF-B, which play a role in tumor angiogenesis, was seen in both node-positive and node-negative tumors</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expression of VEGF-C, a ligand for VEGFR-3, was detectable in some node-positive breast cancers but not in node-negative tumors</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expression of VEGF-D, another ligand for VEGFR-3, was detected only in an inflammatory breast cancer cell line and in a tumor cell line that was developed from an inflammatory skin metastasis</p><p/><p>Thus, activation of VEGFR-3, particularly by VEGF-D in IBC, may be specifically involved in the lymphotactic process through the development of new lymphatic vessels near the tumor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
