It is associated with inflammation, invasion of enteric gas-forming organisms, and dissection of gas into the muscularis and portal venous system.</p><p>NEC occurs in 1 to 3 per 1000 live births and is seen predominantly in preterm infants with an incidence of approximately 6 to 7 percent in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants (BW &lt;1500 g). Although early recognition and aggressive treatment of this disorder has improved clinical outcomes, NEC accounts for substantial long-term morbidity in survivors of neonatal intensive care, particularly in VLBW infants.</p><p>First described in 1965, the etiology of NEC remains uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Based on the available evidence, the pathology and pathogenesis of NEC are reviewed here. The clinical features, management, and prevention of this disorder are discussed separately.

The specific findings vary and depend upon the progression of the disease and the presence of underlying pathogenic factors. The terminal ileum and colon are involved in the majority of cases, although the entire gastrointestinal (GI) tract is affected in severe cases.</p><p>On gross examination, the bowel appears distended and hemorrhagic. Subserosal collections of gas occasionally are present along the mesenteric border. Gangrenous necrosis occurs on the antimesenteric border, and perforation may be present. As the gut heals, thickening of the bowel wall, fibrinous adhesions, and areas of stenosis appear.</p><p>The major histologic findings in NEC are mucosal edema, hemorrhage, and transmural bland necrosis.

Enteral feeding may contribute to the pathogenesis of NEC because human milk and commercial formulas serve as substrates for bacterial proliferation in the gut.</p><p>Newborns, especially preterm infants, have not developed the ability to completely digest and absorb nutrients. As a result, bacterial fermentation products of incompletely digested carbohydrates and lipids (eg, reducing substances, organic acids, short chain fatty acids, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen gas) in the intestine of preterm infants may cause mucosal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Delayed transient time due to impaired motility in the preterm infant exacerbates this process.

Factors present in human milk may play a role in this protection by reducing inflammation or the introduction of foreign antigens in the gastrointestinal tract (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90314\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90314 \">figure 3</a>). Human milk feeding is associated with a lower intestinal pH to facilitate the growth of nonpathogenic bacteria, which counteract pathogenic bacteria. The mucus coat of the intestine is less affected by human milk, and growth factors within human milk (such as epidermal growth factors [EGFs]) repair disruptions in this layer. Human milk improves intestinal motility, which avoids milk stasis and decreases intestinal permeability. Human milk also stimulates the mucosal defense system so that local immune activation is thwarted. Protective factors within human milk include platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase, secretory IgA, cytokines (interleukin [IL]-10, IL-11), EGF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], nucleotides, glutamine, and antioxidants such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-e-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vitamin E</a>, carotene, and glutathione.

After delivery, rapid colonization of the intestinal tract by commensal bacteria from the maternal rectovaginal flora normally occurs. These bacteria play a symbiotic role with the intestine through toll-like receptors by regulating the expression of genes involved in intestinal physiology, postnatal maturation, and function (eg, barrier, digestion, angiogenesis, and production of IgA), and protection against more pathologic organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/8,21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,21-24</a>].</p><p>Increasingly, there is good evidence that this process of commensal bacterial colonization is disrupted in infants who develop NEC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>]. Several studies have shown an association between NEC and intestinal noncommensal bacterial overgrowth, which may cause mucosal injury by affecting intestinal maturation, increasing inflammation and apoptosis, and releasing endotoxins. This pathological process occurs in the absence of a primary infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>A prospective case-control study of 122 very low birth weight (VLBW) infants (BW &lt;1500 g) that identified bacteria in stool samples using primers specific for the bacterial 16S rRNA gene reported an over-representation of potentially pathogenic gram-negative organisms such as <em>Escherichia coli, Enterobacter</em>, and <em>Klebsiella</em> from the stool of 28 infants who developed Bell's stage 2 or 3 NEC based on radiologic criteria, compared with stool samples from matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Empiric antibiotic therapy may contribute to changes in bacterial colonization. Antibiotic administration greater than five days duration is associated with an increased risk of NEC or death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/8,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,28,29</a>].</p><p>The use of probiotic therapy has been proposed to reduce bacterial overgrowth of more invasive bacteria and promote commensal intestinal bacteria, which inhibit inflammatory pathways, thereby decreasing the risk of NEC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/8,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,22</a>]. However, based on the available evidence the use of probiotics should be limited to clinical trials until there is unequivocal evidence that confirms the efficacy and safety of probiotic therapy compared with other preventive modalities, and establishes the most effective regimen for preterm infants (ie, bacterial strain, dosing, and timing and duration of therapy). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis in newborns&quot;, section on 'Probiotics'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Primary infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Less frequently, NEC may be due to primary invasions of the gut by pathogenic enteric bacteria. Bacterial organisms usually found in the distal GI tract have been recovered from the blood and peritoneal cavities of patients with NEC. These organisms include <em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em>, <em>Pseudomonas</em>, and <em>Clostridium difficile </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. In particular, <em>Clostridium</em> species, toxin-producing bacteria that are associated with pseudomembrane formation, submucosal and subserosal gas blebs, and intestinal gangrene, have been associated NEC, particularly more severe cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>].</p><p>In addition to these bacteria, viral and fungal pathogens have been isolated in some sporadic cases of NEC and in epidemic outbreaks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. Virus particles have been isolated from the stools of infants with NEC and their caregivers, including their mothers, the midwives, and the nursery nursing staff. Injury caused by infectious agents may be aggravated by inflammatory mediators. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Inflammation'</a> below.)</p><p>The use of molecular techniques may prove to be a useful tool in evaluating the role of infection in the pathogenesis of NEC. In a small prospective study, stool samples from 12 infants less than 34 weeks gestation who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and gel electrophoresis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. <em>Clostridium perfringens</em> was recognized during the first two weeks of life in the three infants who later developed NEC, but not in the nine infants who did not.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Impaired mucosal defense</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preterm infants are susceptible to the development of NEC because immunologic and GI immaturity results in altered host resistance.

In a prospective case-controlled study of term infants with congenital heart disease, persistent diastolic flow reversal in the abdominal aorta was associated with increased risk of NEC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31669350\"><span class=\"h2\">Anemia and RBC transfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although previous observational studies and a systematic review noted an association between red blood cell (RBC) transfusions and increased risk of NEC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/56-58,63-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-58,63-67</a>], results from a large multicenter observational cohort study reported that severe anemia and not RBC transfusion was associated with NEC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p>In this study of 598 very low birth weight (VLBW) (BW &le;1500 g), multivariable analysis showed no difference in the rate of NEC (defined as Bell stage 2 or greater) between infants exposed to transfusions within a week of developing NEC versus those who were not exposed. In contrast, the risk of NEC was increased in infants with severe anemia (hemoglobin level &le;8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> within the week of developing NEC compared to those who did not have severe anemia (adjusted cause-specific hazard ratio [HR] 5.99, 95% CI 2-18). Unlike previous reports, this study adjusted for confounding factors including BW, center, breastfeeding for less than 10 days, illness severity, and duration of antibiotic therapy.</p><p>These results suggest that clinically-significant anemia is associated with an increased risk for NEC, and that RBC transfusion is only a surrogate marker for anemia. However, the observational nature of this study prohibits the ability to determine causality between NEC and significant anemia, and also does not account for all potential confounding factors (eg, long-term breast feeding beyond 10 days). In addition, further studies are needed to define the minimum&nbsp;hemoglobin threshold&nbsp;for RBC transfusions given the concerns of complications associated with RBC transfusion. Nevertheless, these findings provide an important new perspective regarding the potential role of anemia as a prominent risk factor for NEC. But, until further data are available, we have not altered our transfusion guidelines for preterm infants (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73361\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73361 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusions-in-the-newborn#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusions in the newborn&quot;, section on 'Target hemoglobin or hematocrit'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusions-in-the-newborn#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusions in the newborn&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a>.)</p><p>It has also been proposed that withholding of feeds during transfusion may reduce the risk of NEC; however, data are also inadequate to determine whether or not this practice has any effect on the prevalence of NEC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. As a result, in our practice, we do not withhold feedings during a transfusion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The administration of hyperosmolar medications <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> formulas can cause mucosal injury and may result in NEC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Oral medications such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">theophylline</a>, multivitamins, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenobarbital</a> contain hypertonic additives that might irritate the intestinal mucosa. Instillation of hyperosmolar contrast agents into the bowel for diagnostic radiographic studies also can cause mucosal injury because of fluid shifts, bowel distention, and ischemia. Isotonic contrast agents should be used to avoid this complication. Hyperosmolar formulas, such as those concentrated above recommended strengths or containing multiple additives, should be avoided in the first few weeks after birth.</p><p>Histamine type 2 receptor (H2) antagonists, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cimetidine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cimetidine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranitidine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ranitidine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=famotidine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">famotidine</a>, are associated with higher rates of NEC. This was illustrated in a report from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Neonatal Research Network [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. In this study of 11,072 preterm infants (BW 401 to 1500 g) from 1998 to 2001, the incidence of NEC was 7.1 percent. Infants with NEC compared with matched controls were more likely to have received H2 antagonists (odds ratio [OR] 1.71, 95% CI 1.34-2.19). A possible explanation for this finding is that gastric acidity, which may reduce the risk of NEC by inhibiting bacterial growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>], was lowered by the use of H2 antagonists.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Inflammation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inflammatory mediators induced by ischemia, infectious agents, or mucosal irritants may further aggravate mucosal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/22,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,73</a>]. These soluble inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukins (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, and IL-18), and platelet activating factor (PAF), increase vascular permeability and attract inflammatory cells. Levels of these cytokines are increased in preterm infants with NEC and correlate with the severity of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/22,74-77\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,74-77</a>].</p><p>This cascade of cellular events may be mediated at least in part by PAF, which is synthesized by many cell types, including macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils, and endothelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. In animals, administration of PAF causes intestinal necrosis as well as systemic hypotension, capillary leakage, pulmonary hypertension, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].</p><p>These observations may be applicable to humans. Plasma concentrations of PAF are higher in infants taking milk feedings, although the acetylhydrolase present in human milk breaks down PAF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Plasma acetylhydrolase activity is lower in infants with NEC compared with controls and may contribute to the increased concentrations of PAF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].</p><p>Medications or conditions that affect cytokines or oxygen-free radicals can contribute to the development of NEC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. For example, a deficiency of magnesium or copper can increase the synthesis or activity of cytokines and oxygen-free radicals, leading to intestinal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. In addition, in a trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-e-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vitamin E</a> administration to prevent retinopathy of prematurity, NEC occurred more often in treated infants with high levels of serum tocopherol (greater than 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. The mechanism may be due to a reduction of antimicrobial defenses by excessive scavenging of oxygen-free radicals. On the other hand, treatment with vitamin E is not associated with NEC in infants with lower serum tocopherol concentrations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H633847325\"><span class=\"h3\">Chorioamnionitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chorioamnionitis is an antenatal proinflammatory process involving the placenta and fetal membrane, which may play a contributing role in the pathogenesis of NEC. However, data are inconclusive whether it is a significant clinical risk factor, as illustrated by a systematic review of the literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].

These include not controlling for confounding factors such as GA (incidence of chorioamnionitis and NEC is inversely related to GA) and a lower rate of breastfeeding in mothers with chorioamnionitis (human milk is protective against NEC); and differences among studies in inclusion and exclusion criteria, and criteria for the clinical diagnosis of chorioamnionitis.</p><p>Further investigation is needed to determine whether there is a significant clinical role of chorioamnionitis in the pathogenesis of NEC.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Intestinal vascular resistance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mucosal injury and inflammation may alter the balance of endogenous vasoactive agents, which may contribute to the development of NEC with changes in the intestinal vascular resistance and microcirculation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/40,82-84\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,82-84</a>].

In one report, inducible NO synthase (iNOS) gene and protein expression were detected more often in apical enterocytes in infants undergoing surgical resection for NEC than for intestinal atresia or other noninflammatory conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. These results would suggest that increased NO may contribute to failure of gut barrier function, bacterial translocation, and direct intestinal damage.</p><p/><p>In contrast, another study reported that although endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) was present in specimens from infants undergoing surgical resection for NEC and control patients with intestinal atresia, eNOS function was impaired, resulting in decreased NO production in arterioles from NEC specimens compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-necrotizing-enterocolitis-in-newborns/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].
