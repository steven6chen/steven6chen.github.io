The immunologic responses to grain proteins can be immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediated <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> non-IgE mediated. Food allergy to wheat is best known and manifests with a variety of symptoms and a wide range of clinical syndromes, such as atopic dermatitis exacerbations, exercise-induced anaphylaxis, eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), baker's asthma, and celiac disease. This topic review highlights wheat and also covers other cereal grains including rye, barley, oat, rice, corn, and millet, as well as non-cereal grains including quinoa, amaranth, buckwheat, and sorghum.</p><p>The epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of grain allergy are presented in this topic review.

Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated wheat allergy is reported to affect 0.2 to 1.3 percent of children in Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grain-allergy-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] and 0.4 percent of children in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grain-allergy-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

It was among the most common reported triggers of anaphylaxis, following milk, peanut, and tree nuts. Thirty-seven percent of children with atopic dermatitis referred to a university-based dermatology clinic had clinically significant IgE-mediated food hypersensitivity; of them, 13 percent had wheat allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grain-allergy-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

In another series of patients with atopic dermatitis evaluated in a university-based clinic, oat sensitization was seen in half of the cases with confirmed wheat allergy, but clinical oat allergy was confirmed in less than a third of those [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grain-allergy-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Likewise, corn (maize) allergy was confirmed by OFC in only 5 of 145 children (3 percent) with atopic dermatitis and sensitization to one or more cereal grains (wheat, rice, rye, barley, oat, corn) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grain-allergy-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20088521\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with grain allergy present with a wide range of immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated and non-IgE-mediated clinical syndromes.

These reactions can present with skin, oropharyngeal, upper and lower respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cardiovascular signs and symptoms. Reactions can vary from mild cutaneous reactions to life-threatening anaphylaxis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F58836\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58836 \">table 1</a>). IgE-mediated food allergy is more common in children than adults. Occupational and household exposures involving inhalation of cooking or processing vapors containing grain proteins may cause respiratory symptoms. Casual contact by touching can cause localized urticaria.

Wheat is the most common grain to trigger these types of reactions, which include food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis and baker's asthma. Rice is an uncommon cause of IgE-mediated allergies, particularly with ingestion, but is a reported cause of occupational allergy with respiratory symptoms developing upon inhalation of raw rice dust or rice vapor when rice is boiled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grain-allergy-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Oral allergy syndrome (food-pollen syndrome) has not been reported with grains, presumably because they are consumed in cooked forms rather than raw.

Other grain allergies reported in patients with EoE include corn and rice. Patients with this disorder have symptoms suggestive of gastroesophageal reflux but are unresponsive to conventional reflux therapies. Other presenting symptoms include feeding disorders, vomiting, abdominal pain, dysphagia, and food impaction. Patients with allergic eosinophilic gastroenteritis (eosinophilic gastroenteropathy of the stomach and intestines) may have symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or weight loss.

The typical presentation is that of severe vomiting and diarrhea within two to four hours after ingestion of the offending allergen, causing profound dehydration, lethargy, and sometimes shock. The acute phase can be the first manifestation of FPIES or can occur when the allergen is removed from the diet and then reintroduced. Chronic exposure to the offending allergen may present with vomiting and diarrhea, failure to thrive, and hypoalbuminemia. FPIES is discussed in greater detail separately.

A summary of this information, with a focus on those aspects that are most relevant to the diagnosis of wheat allergy, is provided below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=history-and-physical-examination-in-the-patient-with-possible-food-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;History and physical examination in the patient with possible food allergy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of food allergy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of grain allergy is based upon the history and laboratory testing, when available. The gold standard for diagnosis is a clinician-supervised double-blind, placebo-controlled oral food challenge (DBPCFC), although an open challenge will often suffice. Measurement of grain-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) can aid in the diagnosis of IgE-mediated allergy and may eliminate the need for oral food challenges (OFCs). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oral food challenges for diagnosis and management of food allergies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>With the exception of in vitro immunoassays for specific IgE, other diagnostic allergy procedures, including skin testing and food challenges, should be performed by allergy specialists with training in the management of serious allergic reactions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of skin testing for allergic disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oral food challenges for diagnosis and management of food allergies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20088587\"><span class=\"h2\">IgE mediated</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history of an immediate reaction consisting of typical allergic symptoms, supported by positive tests for specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies, is sufficient to establish a presumptive diagnosis for suspected IgE-mediated reactions. Skin prick tests <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> in vitro tests for IgE are usually performed initially. Higher concentrations of food-specific IgE and larger skin test wheals generally correlate with an increased likelihood of a reaction upon ingestion, although these findings are based upon a limited number of clinical studies and the positive predictive values for wheat are low. In addition, these values are not predictive of the nature or severity of a reaction. Elimination of the suspected grain followed by an OFC can help confirm the diagnosis in unclear cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=history-and-physical-examination-in-the-patient-with-possible-food-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;History and physical examination in the patient with possible food allergy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-food-allergy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of food allergy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-food-challenges-for-diagnosis-and-management-of-food-allergies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oral food challenges for diagnosis and management of food allergies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Both the specific IgE level on blood testing and the skin test wheal size for wheat have poor specificity and sensitivity in predicting OFC outcomes, with most studies showing that even children with high levels of IgE can pass a food challenge to wheat (ie, they are sensitized but not clinically reactive) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grain-allergy-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/28-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-32</a>]. The low positive predictive value of serum-specific IgE to wheat is mainly due to crossreactivity with grass pollen and to the incomplete representation of wheat proteins in the available diagnostic tests, which do not include all the allergens derived from the three wheat protein fractions with different solubility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grain-allergy-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Component-resolved diagnosis may help determine which &quot;positive&quot; tests are clinically relevant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grain-allergy-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/8,34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,34-36</a>]. As an example, the recombinant <em>Phleum pratense</em> (Timothy grass) pollen allergens, rPhl p 1 and rPhl p 5, are marker allergens specific for grass pollen allergy that may be used to identify subjects with grain sensitization due to pollen sensitization (ie, these patients would not be expected to have clinical reactivity to wheat). In a study of 63 children with wheat allergy, the levels of specific IgE to omea5-gliadin, high-molecular-weight (HMW) glutenin, low-molecular-weight (LMW) glutenin, and native gliadin were higher in those with confirmed wheat allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grain-allergy-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In addition, the severity of reactions correlated with specific IgE levels to all four allergens, with omega5-gliadin having the best correlation with challenge outcome.

OFCs may need to be performed to other grains to which the patient is sensitized to confirm that there is clinical reactivity. Concomitant clinical reactivity to wheat, rye, and barley occurs more frequently than to oat, corn, and rice. In one series, only 21 percent of patients with a positive skin prick test to one or more cereals had symptomatic sensitization to cereals, as demonstrated by specific food challenge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grain-allergy-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Another study assessing crossreactivity between wheat, barley, rye, oat, rice, and corn found a strong correlation between wheat and barley-specific IgE concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grain-allergy-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Over half of patients with wheat allergy in this study had a positive feeding test to barley, but corn and rice challenges were negative. Component-resolved diagnosis may help determine which &quot;positive&quot; tests to other grains are clinically relevant. As an example, positive tests to certain allergens may help distinguish between baker's asthma, wheat-induced food allergy, and grass pollen allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/grain-allergy-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].
