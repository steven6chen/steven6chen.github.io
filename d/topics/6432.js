The syndrome usually affects the lower extremities (predominantly the feet) but may also involve the upper extremities (predominantly hands) and rarely concomitantly involves the face. Patients instinctively try to relieve symptoms by cooling the involved areas with fans, cold water, or ice.<strong> </strong></p><p>There is no cure for erythromelalgia; therefore, treatment is focused on improving symptoms. Many patients can be successfully managed with behavioral interventions, topical medications, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>. Other interventions may be beneficial when these measures are insufficient.</p><p>The epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of erythromelalgia will be reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3452338868\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epidemiologic data on erythromelalgia are limited, but erythromelalgia appears to be rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythromelalgia/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. Population-based studies from the United States, Sweden, and Norway have found incidence rates of less than 2 per 100,000 people per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythromelalgia/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. </p><p>Erythromelalgia is more common in women than in men and most often occurs in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythromelalgia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In a population-based study in Olmsted County, Minnesota, the age-adjusted incidence rates were 2 (95% CI 1.2-2.7) per 100,000 women and 0.6 (95% CI 0.1-1.1) per 100,000 men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythromelalgia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The median age at diagnosis was 61 years (range, 16 to 90 years). Among 27 patients with erythromelalgia identified in a Swedish study, the median age was 49 years (interquartile range 34 to 68 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythromelalgia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Erythromelalgia is exceedingly rare in children. In the largest series reported of pediatric erythromelalgia, which included 32 patients (including 22 females) evaluated at an academic medical center between 1970 to 2007, the mean age was 14 years (range, 5 to 18 years) and the mean time to diagnosis was 5.2 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythromelalgia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1215244039\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSOCIATED DISEASES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although originally described in association with myeloproliferative diseases (eg, essential thrombocytosis, chronic myelogenous leukemia, polycythemia vera, myelofibrosis), erythromelalgia appears to be associated with underlying myeloproliferative diseases in less than 10 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythromelalgia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A diagnosis of myeloproliferative disease may precede, follow, or coincide with the development of erythromelalgia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-myeloproliferative-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the myeloproliferative neoplasms&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-essential-thrombocythemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and clinical manifestations of essential thrombocythemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polycythemia-vera\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of polycythemia vera&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A variety of other comorbidities (eg, autoimmune diseases, infections, neoplasms, neurologic diseases), pregnancy, and drug exposures have been reported in patients with erythromelalgia in case reports. However, the relationship between erythromelalgia and these diseases is unclear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2247376007\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some authors have used &quot;primary erythromelalgia&quot; to refer to idiopathic or inherited erythromelalgia and &quot;secondary erythromelalgia&quot; to refer to erythromelalgia that occurs in the setting of an underlying disease associated with erythromelalgia. However, the use of these terms is debated because of the uncertainty regarding the relationship between erythromelalgia and comorbidities other than myeloproliferative disease. Because of this confusion, the author suggests avoidance of the terms &quot;primary&quot; or &quot;secondary&quot; when referring to erythromelalgia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H926459480\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of erythromelalgia is not fully understood. Vascular, neural, and genetic factors may play roles.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vascular factors</strong> &ndash; A role for vascular changes in the pathogenesis of erythromelalgia is suggested by the finding of increased blood flow (up to 10-fold increase as measured by laser Doppler) and temperature in affected areas during symptomatic episodes. Paradoxically, transcutaneous oximetry stays unchanged or is decreased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythromelalgia/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Microvascular arteriovenous shunting is a proposed mechanism for a deficit in skin nutritive perfusion and skin hypoxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythromelalgia/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neuropathy</strong> &ndash; There appears to be a strong association between erythromelalgia and both large and small fiber neuropathy, suggesting a role for neuropathy in the development of symptoms. Large fiber neuropathy is supported by the finding of abnormal electromyography in up to 60 percent of patients; small fiber neuropathy is supported by the detection of abnormal functional testing of small fibers: abnormal quantitative sudomotor axon reflex tests in up to 80 percent of patients and abnormal thermoregulatory sweat testing in up to 90 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythromelalgia/abstract/7,8,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,11,12</a>]. Intriguingly, skin biopsies show decreased epidermal nerve fiber density in only 10 percent, suggesting that the small fiber neuropathy is a functional rather than <span class=\"nowrap\">structural/anatomic</span> neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythromelalgia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Genetics</strong> &ndash; Inherited erythromelalgia is an autosomal dominant disorder that accounts for a small proportion of cases of erythromelalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythromelalgia/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. In the largest series of consecutive patients with erythromelalgia (n = 168), only six patients (4 percent) had a first-degree relative with erythromelalgia, including three members of the same family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythromelalgia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Inherited erythromelalgia is caused by a heterozygous mutation in the <em>SCN9A</em> gene on chromosome 2q24, which encodes a voltage-gated sodium channel. The mutant channels confer hyperexcitability to peripheral sensory and sympathetic neurons, an effect that may contribute to the intense pain associated with erythromelalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythromelalgia/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. <em>SCN9A</em> mutations have not been identified in patients with noninherited erythromelalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythromelalgia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1344203418\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Characteristic precipitating factors for episodes of erythromelalgia include an increase in ambient heat or exercise. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3163644678\"><span class=\"h2\">Signs and symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During episodes, affected areas (typically distal extremities) become red, hot, and painful (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F110935%7EDERM%2F110936%7EDERM%2F110937%7EDERM%2F110938%7EDERM%2F110939\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef110935 graphicRef110936 graphicRef110937 graphicRef110938 graphicRef110939 \">picture 1A-E</a>). Swelling occasionally occurs. The episodes are intermittent and generally last for minutes to hours before resolving. Episodes often occur at night (perhaps associated with increased ambient heat in bed) and during the day occur in association with precipitating factors (for example, increase in ambient heat or exercise). The number of episodes per day is highly variable depending on these precipitating factors. </p><p>Erythromelalgia affects the feet (eg, toes, soles of the feet, dorsum of the feet, or entire feet) in approximately 90 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythromelalgia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The fingers, dorsal hands, or entire hands are affected in approximately 25 percent. Occasionally, erythromelalgia extends to involve more proximal portions of the extremities. Symptoms are usually symmetrical but may be unilateral or more prominent on one side of the body.</p><p>Head and neck involvement (eg, ears, nose, cheeks) is infrequent, occurring in 2 to 3 percent of patients. Whether painful flushing of the face (eg, ears, nose, cheeks) alone can be considered to represent erythromelalgia is debated; we favor a diagnosis of erythromelalgia only if feet <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hands are also involved.</p><p>Pain during episodes is most commonly described as a burning sensation. The pain can be extreme and may seem out of proportion to the observed clinical findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythromelalgia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Between episodes, the characteristic features of redness, heat, and pain in affected body areas are absent. However, in up to two-thirds of patients, the affected areas are cool to the touch and purple in color (acrocyanosis) between episodes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F110940\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef110940 \">picture 2</a>). Features of Raynaud phenomenon also have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythromelalgia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Erythromelalgia usually remains intermittent. Some patients report that symptoms become more frequent and prolonged over months to years. Occasionally, episodes of erythromelalgia become continuous.</p><p>There are no serologic abnormalities specific to erythromelalgia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2551635137\"><span class=\"h2\">Cooling behaviors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A characteristic feature of erythromelalgia is patient use of cooling techniques to achieve symptom relief. In addition to stopping precipitating actions (eg, stopping exercise, decreasing ambient heat by decreasing room temperature) upon onset of an episode, patients often engage in: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of fans on affected area</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immersion of the affected area in ice water, snow, or equivalents </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Application of ice packs, bags of frozen vegetables, battery-powered cooling socks or gloves</p><p/><p>Potential complications of cooling techniques that may be present in patients with erythromelalgia include &quot;windburn&quot; from fans, signs and symptoms of frostbite secondary to overuse of ice (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F110942\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef110942 \">picture 3</a>), Raynaud phenomenon, and acrocyanosis associated with cold exposure. Chronic immersion in water may lead to skin maceration and ulcerations, also known as &quot;immersion foot&quot; or &quot;trench foot&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythromelalgia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1047956084\"><span class=\"h2\">Quality of life</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Erythromelalgia can have a profound negative effect on quality of life. Patients usually avoid precipitating exposures (eg, exercise, warm rooms), which in severe cases can result in becoming housebound, anxious, or depressed secondary to fear of precipitating episodes. Patients with severe symptoms may become wheelchair bound or bed bound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythromelalgia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1378661750\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin biopsies of affected areas show nonspecific changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythromelalgia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1025602894\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A diagnosis of erythromelalgia is made based upon recognition of characteristic signs and symptoms (ie, intermittent episodes of red, hot, painful extremities that may be precipitated by heat or exercise and improve with cooling). Asking the patient to take photographs of the affected areas during an episode is helpful for confirming redness in patients who are asymptomatic at the time of clinical evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythromelalgia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>Skin biopsies do not aid in the diagnosis of erythromelalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythromelalgia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]; the usefulness of biopsies is limited to ruling out other suspected conditions. There are no serologic tests that confirm the diagnosis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H76875081\"><span class=\"h1\">ADDITIONAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the association of erythromelalgia with myeloproliferative disease, a complete blood count with differential should be obtained to assess for signs of underlying myeloproliferative disease. (See <a href=\"#H1215244039\" class=\"local\">'Associated diseases'</a> above.) </p><p>Additional tests, such as electromyography, nerve conduction velocity, and tests for small fiber neuropathy (eg, quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test or thermoregulatory sweat testing), are often abnormal in patients with erythromelalgia, but routine performance of these tests is not essential. The results of these tests do not influence the management of erythromelalgia but provide support for the use of medications for neuropathy in patients with erythromelalgia. (See <a href=\"#H926459480\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1177149997\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1286462059\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of erythromelalgia includes<strong> </strong>other causes of extremity pain, such as large or small fiber neuropathy (which can also be comorbid conditions with erythromelalgia); peripheral vascular disease; metabolic diseases such as Fabry disease; and other causes of red or discolored extremities, such as lipodermatosclerosis, acrocyanosis, Raynaud phenomenon, and cellulitis. The occurrence of red, hot extremities in conjunction with painful episodes distinguishes erythromelalgia form these diseases. Of note, acrocyanosis and Raynaud phenomenon can occur in patients with erythromelalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/erythromelalgia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>In particular, the hyperemic phase of Raynaud phenomenon is characterized by skin blushing and can be mistaken for an episode of erythromelalgia. In contrast to erythromelalgia, the hyperemic phase of Raynaud phenomenon is preceded by sharply demarcated color changes of the skin and digits. Moreover, Raynaud phenomenon is often triggered by cold (rather than heat) exposure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the Raynaud phenomenon&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2289927976\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no cure for erythromelalgia. Therefore, interventions are directed at improving quality of life and reducing symptoms. </p><p>Data on treatments for erythromelalgia are primarily limited to case reports and small case series, precluding conclusions regarding the best approach to treatment. Treatment typically involves a combination of nonpharmacologic interventions, management of identified underlying myeloproliferative disease, pharmacologic interventions, and patient counseling. Pain rehabilitation programs may be useful for patients with debilitating symptoms. A summary of our typical approach to treatment is provided. (See <a href=\"#H483747784\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2252933624\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonpharmacologic measures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonpharmacologic measures should be included in the management of patients with erythromelalgia as they can reduce symptoms and may reduce requirements for pharmacologic therapy. In our experience, the following interventions can be helpful for alleviating episodes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoidance of precipitating factors (increased ambient heat, exercise) as much as possible while maintaining as normal a lifestyle as possible</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exposure of the affected area to cool water for short periods of time (eg, 5 to 10 minutes every one to two hours)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limb elevation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fan use for short periods of time (5 to 10 minutes every one to two hours)</p><p/><p>Cooling measures can result in complications if used inappropriately or excessively. Patients should avoid applying ice or very cold water directly to the skin.

Efficacy data are limited and insufficient for conclusions on the best approach to treatment and best treatment regimens. Comparative trials have not been performed. </p><p>For most patients, nonpharmacologic measures and topical pain-relieving medications improve symptoms, although the response to individual treatments varies widely.

Erythromelalgia most often occurs in adults and is more common in women than in men. (See <a href=\"#H3452338868\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Erythromelalgia is associated with myeloproliferative disease in less than 10 percent of affected patients. A diagnosis of myeloproliferative disease may precede, follow, or occur concurrently with a diagnosis of erythromelalgia. The relationship between erythromelalgia and other systemic diseases is unclear. (See <a href=\"#H1215244039\" class=\"local\">'Associated diseases'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathogenesis of erythromelalgia is not well understood. Vascular, neural, and genetic factors may play roles. A small subset of patients with erythromelalgia have inherited erythromelalgia. Inherited erythromelalgia is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the <em>SCN9A</em> gene. (See <a href=\"#H926459480\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased ambient heat and exercise are common precipitators of episodes of erythromelalgia. During episodes, the affected areas become red, hot, and painful. The feet are the most common sites of involvement. Symptoms are typically bilateral, and episodes may last from seconds to hours. (See <a href=\"#H1344203418\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of erythromelalgia is made based upon the recognition of the classic signs and symptoms. Photographs of the red extremities are helpful in confirming the history and for documenting the redness. The histopathologic findings of erythromelalgia are nonspecific, and no serologic tests confirm the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H1025602894\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with erythromelalgia should be evaluated for myeloproliferative disease. Patients without evidence for myeloproliferative disease at the time of diagnosis should be monitored over time for the development of myeloproliferative disease. (See <a href=\"#H76875081\" class=\"local\">'Additional evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3861446361\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data on treatment of erythromelalgia are limited, and responses to individual treatments vary widely. We suggest an initial therapeutic approach that includes patient counseling regarding methods to minimize symptoms, topical therapy, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For patients with underlying myeloproliferative disease, we also suggest treatment of the myeloproliferative disease (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
