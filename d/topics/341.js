This is particularly important in the first few hours after symptom onset, when the amount of myocardium salvageable by reperfusion is greatest. As the benefits of reperfusion decline rapidly with time, reperfusion should be implemented as soon as possible.

Very high-risk patients should receive primary PCI as soon as possible and within 120 minutes of first medical contact. The issue of whether fibrinolytic therapy might be reasonable for some of these patients with a very long delay to primary PCI is discussed elsewhere.

Primary PCI may be of benefit in some patients, particularly if symptoms of myocardial ischemia are present. In asymptomatic, stable patients who present after 12 hours, there is no evidence that reperfusion with either fibrinolytic therapy or primary PCI is of benefit. </p><p>As fibrinolytic therapy administered at this time is not likely to improve outcomes and as it carries with it the risk of serious bleeding, primary PCI is preferred in most of these patients. However, if PCI is not available, we and others believe it is reasonable to consider fibrinolytic therapy in symptomatic patients who present more than 12 hours (and up to 24 hours) and who have a larger area of myocardium at risk or hemodynamic instability if PCI is not available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-selecting-a-reperfusion-strategy/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].

Thus, for patients in whom there is a long anticipated delay (greater than 120 minutes) to primary PCI, we recommend timely (within 30 minutes of first medical contact) fibrinolysis. Stated another way, if the PCI-related delay (see <a href=\"#H1223528504\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above) is greater than 90 minutes, fibrinolysis is preferred. If fibrinolytic therapy has been chosen as the primary reperfusion strategy, we suggest that most patients receive subsequent angiography and possible PCI of the infarcted artery. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Fibrinolysis followed by PCI'</a> below.)</p><p>The recommendation to choose fibrinolysis rather than PCI if the latter cannot be performed within 120 minutes of first medical contact comes from outcomes of randomized trials and studies of community cohorts: &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 2003 review of 23 randomized trials of primary PCI versus fibrinolysis, which enrolled a total of 7739 patients, the magnitude of the survival benefit from PCI at four to six weeks declined as the mean PCI-related delay increased. When the PCI-related delay was more than 62 minutes, there was no survival advantage to primary PCI over fibrinolysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67756\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67756 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-selecting-a-reperfusion-strategy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the community, door-to-balloon times (see <a href=\"#H1223528504\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above) and PCI-related delays are significantly longer than those in randomized clinical trials, with median door-to-balloon times of about 160 minutes reported (compared to a median of about 100 minutes for patients enrolled in randomized clinical trials) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-selecting-a-reperfusion-strategy/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. In a study of over 19,000 propensity-score matched patients enrolled in the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction 2, 3, 4, and 5 registries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-selecting-a-reperfusion-strategy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], multivariable analysis found no mortality advantage for primary PCI over fibrinolysis in patients with a PCI-related delay longer than approximately 120 minutes. For those groups of patients with PCI delay of &lt;60 and 60 to 90 minutes, the in-hospital death rates favored PCI (2.7 versus 7.4 and 3.6 versus 5.5 percent, respectively), whereas the rates were similar for the group of patients with PCI delay of &gt;90 minutes (5.7 versus 6.1 percent, respectively). It should be kept in mind that there may be confounding factors associated with both increased PCI-related delay and worse outcomes in the observational studies, such as the experience of hospitals and operators in the relevant studies.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Fibrinolysis followed by PCI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest diagnostic coronary angiography and possible PCI for all patients who receive fibrinolytic therapy and we perform PCI within 3 to 24 hours in most of these patients. We recognize that some experts prefer to manage some patients at very low risk (small infarct, inferior location, absence of heart failure or important arrhythmias, or relative contraindications to PCI) with a conservative strategy of &ldquo;watchful waiting&rdquo; with monitoring for spontaneous recurrent ischemia and, if not is seen, stress testing to evaluate for provocable ischemia. If ischemia is present, patients should undergo angiography and revascularization.</p><p>The routine performance of PCI within 3 to 24 hours after fibrinolytic therapy has been referred to as pharmacoinvasive strategy. The evidence to support this approach comes from studies that evaluated adjunctive or early elective PCI and found comparable outcomes. The distinction between adjunctive PCI (in which PCI is performed within <strong>hours</strong> after fibrinolysis) and early elective PCI (in which PCI is performed within a <strong>few days</strong> after fibrinolysis) is somewhat arbitrary and trials have overlap in the timing of PCI. </p><p>The rationale for performing PCI after fibrinolysis is that many patients have a persistent reduction in flow in the infarct-related artery and are at risk for reinfarction. Although fibrinolysis restores patency (TIMI grade 2 or 3) in 80 percent of infarct-related arteries, normalization (TIMI grade 3) of blood flow is seen in only 50 to 60 percent of arteries. As mentioned above, the clinical benefits of fibrinolytic therapy are seen only with the restoration of normal flow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75629\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75629 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70952\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70952 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-selecting-a-reperfusion-strategy/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].

However, a few patient characteristics (discussed below) may influence the time at which outcomes are similar with either reperfusion strategy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-selecting-a-reperfusion-strategy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Strategies that alter the 120-minute rule have not adequately been tested. Until well-performed studies present evidence that 120 minutes is not the optimal cut point for patients with any of these characteristics, we recommend 120 minutes as the cut point between primary PCI and fibrinolysis for most patients, though it is likely that various risk characteristics alter how fast time-dependent benefit of PCI erodes. </p><p>Non-patient-related factors that may increase the PCI delay are long door-to-door transfer times and off-hour presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-selecting-a-reperfusion-strategy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

As the length of time from the onset of symptoms to intervention increases, outcomes are worse irrespective of reperfusion strategy. However, the benefits from reperfusion are lost more quickly with fibrinolytic therapy as the time from symptom onset increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-selecting-a-reperfusion-strategy/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>].

In this early stage, there is an opportunity for substantial myocardial salvage and mortality reduction. It is in this time window that fibrinolytic therapy is most likely to be effective. Thus, for those patients who cannot receive expert primary PCI within approximately 120 minutes of first medical contact, fibrinolytic therapy has an advantage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fibrinolysis-for-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-initiation-of-therapy#H69239847\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fibrinolysis for acute ST elevation myocardial infarction: Initiation of therapy&quot;, section on 'Timing'</a>.)</p><p>The best evidence comparing PCI to fibrinolysis in patients who present within three hours of symptom onset comes from the STREAM study in which 1892 patients who presented within three hours were randomly assigned to undergo either fibrinolytic therapy with bolus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenecteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tenecteplase</a> or primary PCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-selecting-a-reperfusion-strategy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Patients who could undergo PCI within one hour were excluded. In the lytic group, coronary angiography was performed urgently for evidence of reperfusion failure or routinely at 6 to 24 hours. There was no difference in the primary composite end point (death, shock, congestive heart failure, or reinfarction up to 30 days) between the two groups (12.4 versus 14.3 percent, respectively; relative risk 0.86, 95% CI 0.68-1.09). The rates of intracranial hemorrhage were 1.0 and 0.2 percent before a protocol amendment allowed for a lower dose of lytic for patients &ge;75 years. At one year, there was no difference in the rates of all-cause mortality: 6.7 versus 5.9 percent, respectively (risk ratio 1.13, 95% CI 0.79-1.62) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-selecting-a-reperfusion-strategy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Limitations of STREAM include protocol change, enrollment before aspiration thrombectomy became standard practice, and an older approach to the use of antithrombotic therapies. In addition, the elimination of patients who could receive PCI within 60 minutes biases the study in favor of fibrinolysis. Thus, while fibrinolysis leads to efficacy outcomes comparable to primary PCI in patients who present early, we prefer the latter due to concerns about the safety (eg, intracranial hemorrhage) of lytic therapy. </p><p>Approximately half of patients with STEMI present more than three to four hours after symptom onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-selecting-a-reperfusion-strategy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

They are usually better served by the greater efficacy and reduced stroke risk of primary PCI, despite the time required for transfer.
