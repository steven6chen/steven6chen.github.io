Treatment of the different elements of PsA includes coordinated intervention to address the major domains of the disease, including peripheral and axial arthritis, enthesitis, dactylitis, and skin and nail involvement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The treatment of PsA, including peripheral and axial arthritis, enthesitis, and dactylitis, is discussed in this topic review. The treatment of psoriatic skin and nail involvement, the clinical manifestations and diagnosis of PsA, and the pathogenesis of PsA are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of psoriasis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nail-psoriasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nail psoriasis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-psoriatic-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H53776344\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLES AND PRETREATMENT INTERVENTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to treatment includes therapy for both musculoskeletal disease, including peripheral and axial arthritis, enthesitis, and dactylitis, and disease of the skin and nails, and is aimed at controlling inflammation and preventing discomfort, joint damage, and disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. More than one type of musculoskeletal involvement, and frequently cutaneous involvement, often occur in individual patients. General principles of treatment for psoriatic arthritis (PsA) include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients benefit from evaluation and treatment early in the disease by clinicians with expertise in the care of patients with rheumatologic conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>] (see <a href=\"#H72442856\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below), and treatment should be coordinated between the rheumatologist, primary care clinician, and other specialists (eg, the dermatologist). Differences in response to individual therapies between the skin and joints, and between different musculoskeletal manifestations, are commonly observed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment is guided initially by an assessment of disease severity, including the degree of disease activity, damage, and impact on the patient for each clinical domain, followed by initial attention to the most severely involved region such as axial or peripheral arthritis. Due to the common involvement of multiple domains (peripheral arthritis, axial inflammation, dactylitis, enthesitis, skin, and nails) in a single patient, additional considerations regarding optimal therapy may be required. Initiation of a biologic agent for the management of one clinical manifestation (eg, axial arthritis or moderate to severe skin disease) may eliminate the need for additional therapies in the treatment of another manifestation (eg, trial[s] of a conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drug [DMARD] for peripheral arthritis before use of a biologic agent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A treat-to&ndash;target approach should be employed for peripheral and axial arthritis, with a target of remission or minimal disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Evidence suggests that this type of approach can result in improved patient outcomes and reduced disease progression, as progression of damage is predicted by persistent joint inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Comorbidities (eg, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, fatty liver, coronary artery disease) are prevalent in PsA and should be identified because they can affect overall health and treatment selection. Patients should be referred as needed for prevention and medical management of these comorbidities. This last point is particularly important because many patients may be receiving care from a rheumatologist and dermatologist but not a primary care clinician.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pretreatment screening for comorbidities and baseline testing before drug administration in all patients should include screening for cardiovascular risk factors (lipids, blood pressure, and smoking), weight loss counseling for patients with elevated body mass index (BMI), and evaluation (eg, ultrasound) of the liver for patients with elevated liver function tests (LFTs); eg, greater than three times the upper limit of normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Additional testing should include screening for hepatitis in patients initiating <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX) therapy and screening for latent tuberculosis (TB) in patients who may receive biologic agents.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should undergo vaccinations relevant to treatments that may be planned.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H133947607\"><span class=\"h1\">NONPHARMACOLOGIC TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following nonpharmacologic management strategies are important in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in addition to drug therapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Exercise, physical therapy, and occupational therapy</strong> &ndash; Patients should be referred for physical therapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT), encouraged to exercise, referred as needed for orthotics, and educated about joint protection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Weight reduction</strong> &ndash; Obesity and metabolic syndrome are common comorbidities in PsA and may lessen treatment response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> biologic agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-psoriatic-arthritis#H68770867\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis&quot;, section on 'Comorbidities'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=comorbid-disease-in-psoriasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Comorbid disease in psoriasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients should also be instructed about their medications and the proper use of topical and oral medications, as well as the need for regular drug administration and monitoring of disease activity and for side effects of therapies.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H133947860\"><span class=\"h1\">PERIPHERAL ARTHRITIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3274958312\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview of approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of therapy for peripheral arthritis is based upon the severity of disease and the patient's response to treatment. It may also be influenced by comorbidities, patient goals and preferences regarding routes of drug administration and cost of treatment to the patient, and regulatory and insurance requirements.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mild arthritis</strong> &ndash; Patients with mild peripheral arthritis may be effectively treated by use of a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID). (See <a href=\"#H133947948\" class=\"local\">'Mild arthritis/NSAIDs'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Moderate to severe arthritis or resistant to NSAIDs</strong> &ndash; Patients with moderate to severe arthritis or who are resistant to initial NSAID therapy alone are usually treated with a conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leflunomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leflunomide</a> (LEF), unless a biologic DMARD is required for the treatment of other disease manifestations (see <a href=\"#H53776378\" class=\"local\">'Moderate to severe arthritis or resistant to NSAID'</a> below). Some patients with mild to moderate arthritis benefit from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apremilast-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">apremilast</a>, which can be used instead of a nonbiologic or biologic DMARD. In particular, it can be useful for patients who wish to avoid DMARD therapy, infusions, or injections, although only a portion of patients respond. (See <a href=\"#H3561427080\" class=\"local\">'Apremilast'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Severe disease at presentation</strong> &ndash; In patients presenting with severe disease, such as those with many involved joints, erosive disease at presentation, and functional limitation, we suggest a biologic DMARD (eg, a tumor necrosis factor [TNF] inhibitor) as first line therapy, rather than a conventional nonbiologic DMARD. We prefer this approach because of its capacity to limit joint damage and more rapidly restore function. (See <a href=\"#H134301892\" class=\"local\">'Severe peripheral arthritis/adverse prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Resistant to nonbiologic DMARD</strong> &ndash; In patients with peripheral arthritis but an inadequate response to a conventional DMARD, treatment with a biologic DMARD, such as a TNF inhibitor, is usually indicated. An alternative biologic, with a different target, may be required in patients with an inadequate response to TNF inhibitors. Such biologic agents can differ from each other and TNF inhibitors in their efficacy for different disease manifestations. (See <a href=\"#H53776365\" class=\"local\">'Resistant to nonbiologic DMARDs'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Since progressive joint damage is more likely in patients with a larger number of inflamed joints at the outset, patients with polyarticular involvement may benefit from early introduction of DMARDs. Notably, however, no DMARDs have been proven to slow or prevent radiographic damage. Thus, the role of these agents for patients with baseline damage is of uncertain value but is often required when access to TNF inhibitors is limited.</p><p>The choice of the DMARD depends, in part, upon whether the patient has active or severe psoriasis as well as arthritis. Medications used for control of psoriasis should be considered in individuals in whom the psoriasis and arthritis are of roughly equal severity. Drugs such as MTX, photochemotherapy with psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA), use of retinoic acid derivatives, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> A have been shown to improve both the joint and skin manifestations of psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/1,2,12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,12-14</a>]. However, none of these medications has actually been shown to prevent or retard progression of joint damage. Inhibitors of TNF-alpha may also be effective for both skin and joint disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H133947948\"><span class=\"h2\">Mild arthritis/NSAIDs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with mild arthritis, defined as disease involving less than four joints, no radiological evidence of damage, and minimal discomfort or functional impairment, we suggest initiating treatment with an NSAID (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> 375 to 500 mg twice daily, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a> 200 mg twice daily) rather than starting a DMARD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Other NSAIDs that we use in patients with peripheral arthritis include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> (up to 2400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diclofenac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diclofenac</a> (up to 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketoprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketoprofen</a> (up to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span>. There is general consensus by experts that NSAIDs, including both nonselective NSAIDs, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a>, and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 selective NSAIDs, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a>, can help control the mild inflammatory symptoms of PsA and may also lessen pain and stiffness in spondylitis, although there is very limited evidence from randomized trials in patients with PsA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/1,2,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,15-17</a>]. While there has been some concern that NSAIDs may aggravate the skin psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/12,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,18</a>], in one randomized trial of a COX-2 selective inhibitor (which was not approved for commercial use) there was no significant difference in an index of skin involvement between the two groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Comparative studies have not found any difference in efficacy between different NSAIDs. As a result, the choice of an NSAID depends upon the individual clinician's familiarity with a particular drug, patient preference regarding frequency of administration, and individual patient tolerance. The COX-2 selective inhibitor etoricoxib can also be given in a once-daily dosis of 60 or 90 mg, but this drug is not available in the United States or Canada.</p><p>One difficulty with NSAIDs, particularly in PsA where many patients may already have increased cardiovascular risk, is the additional cardiovascular risk typically associated with the use of these agents. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonselective-nsaids-adverse-cardiovascular-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonselective NSAIDs: Adverse cardiovascular effects&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cox-2-selective-inhibitors-adverse-cardiovascular-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;COX-2 selective inhibitors: Adverse cardiovascular effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An alternative agent for use in patients with mild PsA and multiple comorbidities is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apremilast-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">apremilast</a>, particularly in patients who wish to avoid DMARD therapy, infusions, or injections, although only a portion of patients respond. (See <a href=\"#H3561427080\" class=\"local\">'Apremilast'</a> below.)</p><p>In patients with only one or two swollen joints (mono- or oligoarthritis), we generally perform a joint aspiration and intraarticular glucocorticoid injection. Although there are no randomized trials demonstrating efficacy of intraarticular injections, an observational cohort study revealed effectiveness of intraarticular injections in PsA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Care should be taken in patients who require intraarticular glucocorticoid injections to avoid injection through psoriatic plaques. We generally avoid the use of oral glucocorticoids. (See <a href=\"#H2055578428\" class=\"local\">'Role of glucocorticoids'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H53776378\"><span class=\"h2\">Moderate to severe arthritis or resistant to NSAID</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H316312895\"><span class=\"h3\">Choice of nonbiologic DMARD and other agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We take the following approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients whose peripheral arthritis remains active (ie, persistent joint inflammation) despite the use of NSAIDs, we suggest starting with a conventional (small molecule) DMARD rather than a biologic agent. We prefer MTX (15 to 25 mg once weekly) in patients with peripheral arthritis who lack axial symptoms or in whom axial symptoms that may be present, such as back pain, are well-controlled with NSAIDs (see <a href=\"#H133948651\" class=\"local\">'Methotrexate'</a> below). We also use this approach for initial therapy in patients with more than mild disease who lack erosive joint changes or substantial functional limitations. (See <a href=\"#H134301892\" class=\"local\">'Severe peripheral arthritis/adverse prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We initiate or continue NSAIDs as bridging or adjunctive therapy as needed in patients begun on DMARDs. (See <a href=\"#H133947948\" class=\"local\">'Mild arthritis/NSAIDs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who are intolerant of MTX, unwilling to use this agent (eg, because they perceive it as &quot;chemotherapy&quot;), or unresponsive to MTX, we use LEF (20 mg daily) (see <a href=\"#H69794688\" class=\"local\">'Leflunomide'</a> below). However, unlike MTX, which is also effective for psoriasis in some patients, LEF is generally not beneficial for the skin disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other medications may be used occasionally in individuals with PsA unable to use MTX or LEF and in whom the psoriasis does not pose a particular problem. Included in this group are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a> (SSZ), antimalarials, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>. We usually use SSZ as an alternative to MTX in patients with a contraindication to MTX or LEF (eg, refusal or inability to give up alcohol intake), but the likely degree of benefit is low. (See <a href=\"#H3702182963\" class=\"local\">'Sulfasalazine'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients with arthritis benefit from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apremilast-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">apremilast</a>, which can be used instead of a nonbiologic or biologic DMARD. It may be useful for patients who wish to avoid DMARD therapy, infusions, or injections, although only a portion of patients respond. It should not be used in patients with erosive disease, as the capacity of apremilast to prevent joint injury has not been established. (See <a href=\"#H3561427080\" class=\"local\">'Apremilast'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H133948651\"><span class=\"h4\">Methotrexate</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3194559606\"><span class=\"h5\">MTX use and efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MTX should be increased rapidly as tolerated to 15 mg orally once weekly then as required up to the 25 mg once weekly. Patients receiving MTX should also be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> (1 mg daily) to reduce the risk of adverse effects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of methotrexate in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Prior to initiating MTX therapy, patients should undergo routine laboratory testing, including hematology and biochemistry to confirm normal liver function. They should also have their hepatitis status tested, as well as a chest radiograph. Any required vaccinations should be administered before initiating DMARD therapy. The use of MTX in patients with obesity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> type II diabetes mellitus should be avoided, if possible, given the increased risk of hepatic fibrosis in patients with these comorbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3623084392\" class=\"local\">'MTX safety and monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p>In patients with an inadequate response to doses of MTX greater than 17.5 mg weekly given orally, we switch to the subcutaneous route, which improves absorption of the medication, as shown in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and which patients may self-administer. Alternatively, splitting the dose over a 24-hour period orally (morning, evening, and next morning) may improve pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of methotrexate in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;, section on 'Dosing of MTX'</a>). With the correct dose, a response should occur within eight weeks of initiating therapy.</p><p>In patients using parenteral rather than oral MTX, the subcutaneous route may be more beneficial than the intramuscular route and is more convenient for patients who can self-administer the medication. Parenteral MTX can be increased up to 25 or, rarely, 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week</span>.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Folic acid</a> supplementation should be provided to all patients taking MTX. Patients who do not have a satisfactory response to folic acid or who poorly tolerate it may instead be prescribed <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a> (folinic acid), usually the day after MTX. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-low-dose-methotrexate#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of low-dose methotrexate&quot;, section on 'Prevention of side effects with folate'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of methotrexate in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>MTX is the most commonly used first-line DMARD in PsA, although only limited data are available supporting its efficacy in PsA. Despite the lack of randomized trial evidence of efficacy, observational studies and our clinical experience indicate that MTX may be effective for some patients in clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. Expert opinion also supports use of MTX as a first-line DMARD, including treatment guidelines of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/16,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,24</a>] and the Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (GRAPPA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/17,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,25</a>]; we prefer it as well based upon ease of use, tolerability, and proven efficacy in psoriasis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-psoriasis-in-adults#H31\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of psoriasis in adults&quot;, section on 'Methotrexate'</a>.)</p><p>While most randomized trials and other studies using MTX have not shown significant benefit, they have all had significant limitations, including the use of lower (sometimes much lower) doses of MTX than are routinely used in practice; patient populations with very longstanding disease, often more than 10 years' duration; small numbers of subjects; trials of short duration; and other elements of poor study design. For example, the largest randomized controlled trial with MTX was the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methotrexate</a> in Psoriatic Arthritis (MIPA) trial, which failed to show that MTX was superior to placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Although this trial did not show efficacy of MTX over placebo, the maximum dose was only 15 mg weekly given orally, the burden of joint involvement was low, and the high dropout rate may have reduced the strength of the trial. The <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Etanercept</a> and Methotrexate in Combination or as Monotherapy in Psoriatic Arthritis trial (also termed the SEAM trial; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02376790) is a randomized trial that is ongoing and will provide additional evidence to inform treatment choices. Prevention of radiologic joint injury has not been demonstrated.</p><p>The maximal response to MTX is usually achieved within three months of treatment with the drug. Patients who do not respond to MTX 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/week</span> for six to eight weeks are unlikely to respond to more prolonged therapy. On the other hand, discontinuation of MTX in responders is often associated with severe flares of both skin and joint disease. We thus suggest that patients who wish to discontinue MTX do so using a slow taper. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-methotrexate-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of methotrexate in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3623084392\"><span class=\"h5\">MTX safety and monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most serious potential side effects of MTX include liver toxicity, interstitial lung disease, and bone marrow suppression. Data are not available for prevalence of liver toxicity in PsA. However, in a study of 71 psoriasis patients on MTX, 169 serial biopsies were analyzed, and type 2 diabetes and obesity were major risk factors for progressive fibrosis even at lower doses of MTX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The role of liver biopsy in monitoring hepatotoxicity in patients treated with MTX has been controversial. One study of 54 patients with psoriasis or PsA treated with MTX for a mean of 6.9 years found that the use of laboratory tests alone could adequately identify liver toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>National organizations have published different recommendations concerning the role of liver biopsies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) and the National Psoriasis Foundation do NOT require liver biopsies in all patients administered MTX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].

LEF can also be prescribed as a first-line DMARD for patients with a low skin burden of psoriasis. In addition, the use of LEF following an inadequate response to MTX may be required by some insurers or regulatory agencies prior to the approval of a biologic DMARD.

As an example, in a phase 3 randomized trial involving 504 patients with active PsA, the Psoriatic Arthritis Long-term Assessment of Clinical Efficacy (PALACE-1) trial, apremilast (20 or 30 mg twice daily) was significantly more likely than placebo to result in an ACR20 (31 and 40 versus 19 percent) at week 16 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Benefit was observed in patients on both background traditional DMARDs (eg, MTX, LEF, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> SSZ) and in patients not on DMARDs. A minority of the patients had previously received a biologic DMARD; some of these patients showed benefit, although less than the biologic-na&iuml;ve patients. Statistically significant functional improvement with apremilast, compared with placebo, was also observed (Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) disability index [HAQ-DI] changes of -0.20 and -0.25 versus -0.09). Benefit was sustained in patients continuing apremilast for 52 weeks (ACR20 on the lower and higher apremilast doses in 55 and 63 percent, respectively), and responses were also maintained for secondary outcomes including skin psoriasis severity and physical function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>The most common adverse effects in the PALACE-1 trial were mild gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea and nausea.

We prefer a TNF inhibitor in this setting because of the greater experience that exists with these agents, as well as the greater number of trials providing evidence of benefit.

Assessment of the treatment response should be individualized to incorporate other domains of disease activity in addition to arthritis, such as psoriatic skin involvement, dactylitis, and enthesitis, particularly in patients with moderate to severe involvement in these other domains. With respect to the musculoskeletal manifestations, a target of minimal disease activity (MDA) is desirable, but these manifestations may not be the most prominent aspects of disease in some patients. (See <a href=\"#H49302410\" class=\"local\">'Other assessment measures'</a> below.)</p><p>We initially add the TNF inhibitor, while continuing the conventional DMARD (eg, MTX).

In addition, patients need regular monitoring for adverse effects of medications. Patients should be monitored more closely when new medications are being initiated, depending upon the expected response time.

In addition to a joint count, the severity of periarticular involvement can be determined by the number of areas affected by enthesitis, with particular attention, at a minimum, to the Achilles tendon insertions and the plantar fascia in each foot, as well as the epicondyles, since these areas have been shown to be most commonly affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-psoriatic-arthritis/abstract/130\" class=\"abstract_t\">130</a>], and identification and a count of the number of digits affected by dactylitis.

Differences in response to individual therapies between the skin and joints, and between different musculoskeletal manifestations, are commonly observed. Treatment is guided initially by an assessment of disease severity, including the degree of disease activity, damage, and impact on the patient for each clinical domain. Attention to the most severely involved region, such as axial or peripheral arthritis, should help guide therapy. (See <a href=\"#H53776344\" class=\"local\">'Management principles and pretreatment interventions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A treat-to&ndash;target approach should be employed for peripheral and axial arthritis, with a target of remission or minimal disease activity (MDA). Patients should undergo pretreatment screening for comorbidities and baseline testing and appropriate vaccinations before drug administration. They should be referred as needed for prevention and medical management of comorbidities, such as cardiovascular and liver disease and related risk factors. (See <a href=\"#H53776344\" class=\"local\">'Management principles and pretreatment interventions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonpharmacologic management strategies are important in the treatment of PsA in addition to drug therapy; these include physical and occupational therapy, exercise, prescription of orthotics, and education regarding the disease and about joint protection, disease management, and proper use of medications. Patients should receive assistance in weight reduction and management of cardiovascular risk factors and other comorbidities. (See <a href=\"#H133947607\" class=\"local\">'Nonpharmacologic treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with mild peripheral arthritis, defined as disease involving less than four joints, no radiological evidence of damage, and minimal discomfort or functional impairment, we suggest initiating treatment with a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID; eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> 375 to 500 mg twice daily, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a> 200 mg twice daily) rather than starting a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). NSAIDs can help to control the mild inflammatory symptoms of PsA and may also lessen pain and stiffness in associated spondylitis. A concern that NSAIDs may aggravate the skin psoriasis remains unproven. An alternative that may be effective and safer for some patients, particularly those with multiple comorbidities, is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apremilast-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">apremilast</a> (30 mg twice daily). (See <a href=\"#H133947948\" class=\"local\">'Mild arthritis/NSAIDs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients whose peripheral arthritis remains active despite the use of NSAIDs or is moderate to severe without erosions or substantial functional limitations, and who lack axial symptoms or have such symptoms as are well-controlled with NSAIDs, we suggest a conventional (small molecule) DMARD, usually <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX; 15 to 25 mg once weekly) rather than a biologic agent (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Limited randomized trial data support the use of a conventional DMARD in PsA, but its use is supported by evidence of benefit in other forms of inflammatory polyarthritis, efficacy for psoriasis, expert opinion, and clinical experience in such patients. We initiate or continue NSAIDs as bridging or adjunctive therapy as needed in patients begun on DMARDs. (See <a href=\"#H316312895\" class=\"local\">'Choice of nonbiologic DMARD and other agents'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3194559606\" class=\"local\">'MTX use and efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alternatives to MTX for the peripheral arthritis include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leflunomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leflunomide</a> (LEF; 20 mg daily) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a> (SSZ), which can be tried in patients unable to take either MTX or LEF. However, unlike MTX, which is also effective for psoriasis in some patients, LEF is less helpful than MTX for the skin disease. Another alternative to MTX is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apremilast-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">apremilast</a>, which may be particularly useful for patients who wish to avoid DMARD therapy, infusions, or injections, although only a portion of patients respond. Apremilast should not be used in patients with erosive disease, as the capacity of apremilast to prevent joint injury has not been established or adequately examined in PsA or in other forms of inflammatory arthritis. (See <a href=\"#H316312895\" class=\"local\">'Choice of nonbiologic DMARD and other agents'</a> above and <a href=\"#H69794688\" class=\"local\">'Leflunomide'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3561427080\" class=\"local\">'Apremilast'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3702182963\" class=\"local\">'Sulfasalazine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients presenting with severe disease who already have erosive disease and functional limitation, we suggest a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor as first-line therapy, rather than a conventional nonbiologic DMARD (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Another biologic DMARD (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secukinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secukinumab</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ustekinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ustekinumab</a>) is an alternative to a TNF inhibitor in such patients. We prefer this approach because of the capacity of the TNF inhibitors and other biologic agents, demonstrated in multiple randomized trials and in contrast to MTX and the other conventional nonbiologic DMARDs, to limit joint damage and more rapidly restore function. (See <a href=\"#H134301892\" class=\"local\">'Severe peripheral arthritis/adverse prognosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4921583\" class=\"local\">'Choice of TNF inhibitor'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4921597\" class=\"local\">'TNF inhibitor use and efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients whose joint counts do not improve substantially after three months of treatment with a conventional nonbiologic DMARD (eg, MTX), or who still have more than three tender and swollen joints, we recommend a TNF inhibitor rather than sequential trials of other conventional DMARDs (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). The choice of the agent is based upon patient preferences for route (subcutaneous versus intravenous) and frequency of administration, regulatory and payor requirements and limitations, and potential cost to the patient. (See <a href=\"#H53776365\" class=\"local\">'Resistant to nonbiologic DMARDs'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4921583\" class=\"local\">'Choice of TNF inhibitor'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4921597\" class=\"local\">'TNF inhibitor use and efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with peripheral arthritis who experience an inadequate response to an initial TNF inhibitor, we use a second TNF inhibitor rather than trying a different class of biologic agent. We prefer to switch from one of the antibody-based agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=golimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">golimumab</a>, or certolizumab) to the soluble TNF receptor (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a>) and vice versa. (See <a href=\"#H3741494277\" class=\"local\">'Choice of agent'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with peripheral arthritis who do not respond adequately to two different TNF inhibitors, we use an alternative biologic agent rather than another TNF inhibitor. We prefer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secukinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secukinumab</a> (administered by subcutaneous injection, usually with a loading dose of 150 mg given at weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, followed by 150 mg every four weeks; it may be increased to 300 mg every four weeks in patients who continue to have active arthritis). In patients without an adequate response to secukinumab, we use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ustekinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ustekinumab</a> (by subcutaneous injection, 45 mg, given initially and four weeks later, then every 12 weeks, with a higher dose of 90 mg for patients with coexistent moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis weighing greater than 100 kg [220 lbs] initially and four weeks later, followed by 90 mg every 12 weeks). Either of these agents may be given with or without MTX. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abatacept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Abatacept</a> is another treatment option for patients in whom other drugs have failed or have contraindications. (See <a href=\"#H3741494277\" class=\"local\">'Choice of agent'</a> above and <a href=\"#H791398754\" class=\"local\">'Secukinumab'</a> above and <a href=\"#H57761774\" class=\"local\">'Ustekinumab'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with mild symptoms of axial disease, which includes patients with inflammatory back pain that does not interfere with function, we suggest NSAIDs in antiinflammatory dose regimens (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> 375 to 500 mg twice daily, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a> 100 to 150 mg daily in divided doses, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a> 200 mg twice daily), rather than a biologic agent (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H133947879\" class=\"local\">'Mild axial symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with axial symptoms that do not respond adequately to treatment with NSAIDs, such as those with prolonged morning stiffness and severe pain, interfering with function, we recommend a TNF inhibitor rather than a traditional nonbiologic DMARD, as the latter have been shown to be ineffective in spondylitis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). The choice of agent and dosing are the same as those used for peripheral arthritis. (See <a href=\"#H53776365\" class=\"local\">'Resistant to nonbiologic DMARDs'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4921583\" class=\"local\">'Choice of TNF inhibitor'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4921597\" class=\"local\">'TNF inhibitor use and efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with axial symptoms that do not respond adequately to initial therapy with a TNF inhibitor, we use the same approach described for peripheral arthritis, switching to a second TNF inhibitor and, if that is inadequate, to an alternative biologic agent such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secukinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secukinumab</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ustekinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ustekinumab</a>. (See <a href=\"#H4921835\" class=\"local\">'Peripheral arthritis resistant to initial TNF inhibitor'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with enthesitis or dactylitis, a response is often seen with medications used for other manifestations of PsA. In patients with enthesitis causing functional impairment who do not respond to NSAIDs and local therapy, we use a biologic agent, initially a TNF inhibitor. In patients with dactylitis who do not respond to NSAIDS, a response to a conventional DMARD (eg, MTX 15 to 25 mg once weekly) is sometimes seen, but if a conventional nonbiologic DMARD is inadequate patients should be treated with a biologic agent (eg, a TNF inhibitor). (See <a href=\"#H133948046\" class=\"local\">'Enthesitis and dactylitis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H48734891\" class=\"local\">'Enthesitis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2446732216\" class=\"local\">'Dactylitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of oral glucocorticoids in patients with PsA should be avoided, and when required (eg, for severe flares), the dose should be the minimum needed, since their use is associated with an increased chance of developing erythroderma or pustular psoriasis; in addition, there appears to be interference with the effect of other drugs. It is important, however, to taper the glucocorticoids slowly and with close observation for the development of erythroderma or pustular psoriasis. Intraarticular glucocorticoids are sometimes used, and care should be taken in patients who require such injections to avoid injection through psoriatic plaques. (See <a href=\"#H2055578428\" class=\"local\">'Role of glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PsA has variable disease expression; a significant proportion of patients may develop destructive and potentially disabling disease. Factors predicting a poor prognosis include a higher number of actively inflamed joints, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP), failure of previous medication trials, the presence of joint damage, loss of function, and diminished quality of life. (See <a href=\"#H72442856\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical monitoring of disease should include joint counts that assess both the upper and lower extremities, and the number of areas involved by enthesitis and by dactylitis. In clinical practice, plain film radiography of clinically involved peripheral joints, the sacroiliac joints, and the spine are used to assess the extent and progression of disease at these sites.
