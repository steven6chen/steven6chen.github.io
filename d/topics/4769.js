In endemic areas, neurocysticercosis is an important cause of adult-onset seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention/abstract/2-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-7</a>].</p><p>The epidemiology and transmission of cysticercosis will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of cysticercosis and the life cycle of <em>T. solium</em> are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cysticercosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cysticercosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cysticercosis-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cysticercosis: Treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intestinal-tapeworms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intestinal tapeworms&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 50 million people worldwide are estimated to have cysticercosis infection, although estimates are probably low since many infections are subclinical and there are relatively few population-based data on prevalence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>]. Cysticercosis is endemic in many regions of Central and South America, sub-Saharan Africa, India, and Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention/abstract/2-7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-7,9</a>]. The prevalence of cysticercosis varies within these countries and is often higher in rural or periurban areas where pigs are raised and sanitary conditions are suboptimal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention/abstract/2-6,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6,9</a>]. In some such communities, the rate of epilepsy approaches 3 percent, and 25 to 40 percent of these cases have evidence of cysticercosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention/abstract/3-5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5,7</a>].</p><p>Individuals with cysticercosis also present for medical attention outside of endemic areas, particularly where there are significant numbers of immigrants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. A review of a national database estimated that there were 18,584 hospitalizations for neurocysticercosis in the United States between 2003 and 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In a prospective study of 1800 patients presenting with seizures to 11 United States emergency departments over a two-year period, neurocysticercosis was the etiologic agent in about 2 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Neurocysticercosis was observed more frequently in emergency departments of Los Angeles, Phoenix, and Albuquerque (5.7 percent), which had a higher proportion of immigrant Hispanic patients than the other hospitals. Travelers to endemic areas represent another source of cysticercosis, although such infection accounts for a minority of cases in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention/abstract/11,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,14,15</a>].</p><p>Individuals with no history of pork consumption or travel to endemic areas can also develop neurocysticercosis. In a report of four cases in an Orthodox Jewish community (whose dietary laws strictly prohibit consumption of pork), infection was transmitted by domestic workers who had recently emigrated from Latin American countries where <em>T. solium</em> is endemic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated tight clustering in households; household contacts of patients with neurocysticercosis have a threefold higher risk of positive serology for cysticercosis in comparison with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">LIFE CYCLE AND TRANSMISSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cysticercosis is transmitted by ingestion of <em>T. solium</em> eggs shed in the stool of a human tapeworm carrier (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F75531\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75531 \">figure 1</a>). Following ingestion, embryos (oncospheres) hatch in the small intestine, invade the bowel wall, and disseminate hematogenously to brain, striated muscles, liver, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other tissues. Over a period of three to eight weeks, tissue cysticerci develop; these consist of membranous walls filled with fluid and an invaginated scolex. Cysts located in the brain result in neurocysticercosis; humans with cysticercosis are incidental dead end hosts. The median incubation period prior to onset of symptoms is 3.5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Humans become <em>T. solium</em> tapeworm carriers by ingesting undercooked pork containing cysticerci in muscle tissue. Once ingested, the scolex evaginates and attaches to the human small intestine by its suckers and hooks. Proglottids (segments) arise from the base of the scolex, gradually enlarge and are displaced from the neck by new proglottids. The proglottids mature over a period of two to four months. Adult tapeworms can reside in the small intestine for years; they may develop up to 7 m in length with each proglottid segment containing 50,000 to 100,000 eggs.</p><p>Some patients with cysticercosis are tapeworm carriers, and most individuals with intestinal tapeworm infection do not develop symptomatic cysticercosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, human tapeworm carriers are at risk for fecal-oral autoinoculation of eggs and subsequent development of cysticercosis.</p><p>Pigs acquire infection through ingestion of food or water contaminated by infected human feces. Rates of transmission are high in rural communities where pigs roam free and human fecal contamination of soil is common. Pig-to-pig transmission also occurs, although the magnitude and effect of this transmission on rates of human infection is not fully understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>A common misconception is that cysticercosis is acquired by eating pork. However, as the above life cycle illustrates, ingestion of infected pork only causes adult tapeworm infestation (taeniasis) because infected pork contains the larval cysts that develop into adult worms in human intestine but does not contain the eggs that cause cysticercosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Transmission of cysticercosis was previously thought to occur by indirect means, such as by the ingestion of produce irrigated with water contaminated with human feces containing <em>T. solium</em> eggs. However, epidemiological evidence suggests that the most common source of infective eggs is an asymptomatic household tapeworm carrier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Therefore, cysticercosis should be viewed as a disease largely transmitted from person to person, with infected pigs as perpetuators of infection.</p><p>The <em>Taenia </em>life cycle is discussed in further detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intestinal-tapeworms#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intestinal tapeworms&quot;, section on 'Taeniasis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several stages of transmission that can be targeted, and eradication programs likely require implementation of all of these strategies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cysticercosis-epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Tapeworms in humans</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preventing human tapeworm infection is important for reducing the reservoir of egg carriers and can be done by eliminating human consumption of pork contaminated with viable cysticerci. Methods include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inspection of pork for cysticerci, which are visible in raw meat (&quot;measly meat&quot;). This method has been successful in countries with the appropriate resources but not in resource-limited settings in which inspection can be bypassed and the economic consequences of pig condemnation are severe.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Freezing or adequately cooking meat to destroy cysticerci; pickling and salting are not adequate techniques.

This can be given as a single dose of 2 g (four chewable tablets) in adults, 1.5 g in children over 34 kg, and 1 g in children between 11 and 34 kg. Niclosamide is no longer marketed in the United States. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=praziquantel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Praziquantel</a> can be used as an alternative at a dose of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> in a single dose.
