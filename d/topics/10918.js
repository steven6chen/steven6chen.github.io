These tumors are characterized by variable but most often indolent biologic behavior. They are also classically characterized by their ability to secrete peptides resulting in distinctive hormonal syndromes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1970242\"><span class=\"h2\">Classification and nomenclature</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NETs can arise at different sites within the body and are classified according to their histologic features. While there are differences in terminology and grading depending on site of origin, all commonly used classification systems reflect a basic separation between more indolent, well-differentiated tumors (which in the digestive system have been traditionally referred to as carcinoid and pancreatic neuroendocrine [islet cell] tumors) and far more aggressive poorly-differentiated types that behave clinically more like small cell carcinoma of the lung.

heterogeneous group of malignancies characterized by variable but most often indolent biologic behavior. Clinical behavior and prognosis correlate closely with histologic differentiation and grade. The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies well-differentiated gastroenteropancreatic NETs into low grade (G1) and intermediate grade (G2) categories based upon proliferative rate as assessed by mitotic count <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> Ki67 labeling index (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F60365\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60365 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metastatic-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors-local-options-to-control-tumor-growth-and-symptoms-of-hormone-hypersecretion/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. With rare exceptions, all poorly-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors are high-grade (G3) neuroendocrine carcinomas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-classification-and-grading-of-neuroendocrine-neoplasms-arising-in-the-digestive-system#H2474956\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology classification, and grading of neuroendocrine neoplasms arising in the digestive system&quot;, section on '2010 WHO classification and 2017 update'</a>.)</p><p>Among patients with low or intermediate-grade histology and distant disease, survival is highly variable and can depend on other factors, including primary tumor location. As an example, among patients with advanced carcinoid tumors, outcome is worst for patients with lung and colon (other than cecum) primaries (median survival 17 and 7 months, respectively) and most favorable for tumors arising in the jejunum, ileum, and cecum (median survival 55 to 65 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metastatic-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors-local-options-to-control-tumor-growth-and-symptoms-of-hormone-hypersecretion/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This wide difference in natural history complicates the comparative assessment of benefit from individual therapies.</p><p>Patients with metastases from a gastroenteropancreatic NET may become symptomatic from hormone hypersecretion rather than from tumor bulk. Approximately 10 to 30 percent of pancreatic NETs secrete hormones resulting in clinical syndromes; additionally, patients with midgut (small bowel or appendiceal) carcinoid tumors may develop carcinoid syndrome, typically after development of hepatic metastases and entry of vasoactive substances such as serotonin into the systemic circulation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-of-the-carcinoid-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features of the carcinoid syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-localization-and-staging-of-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification, epidemiology, clinical presentation, localization, and staging of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Symptoms of hormonal excess from pancreatic NETs and carcinoid tumors can often be well controlled with somatostatin analogs, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lanreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lanreotide</a>. Similarly, somatostatin analogs, molecularly &quot;targeted&quot; therapies, and cytotoxic chemotherapy may be beneficial in controlling tumor growth. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metastatic-well-differentiated-gastrointestinal-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors-systemic-therapy-options-to-control-tumor-growth-and-symptoms-of-hormone-hypersecretion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Metastatic well-differentiated gastrointestinal neuroendocrine (carcinoid) tumors: Systemic therapy options to control tumor growth and symptoms of hormone hypersecretion&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In patients with limited metastases, however, local options can also be considered. The following sections will discuss local treatment options to control symptoms and tumor growth. Systemic options are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metastatic-well-differentiated-gastrointestinal-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors-systemic-therapy-options-to-control-tumor-growth-and-symptoms-of-hormone-hypersecretion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Metastatic well-differentiated gastrointestinal neuroendocrine (carcinoid) tumors: Systemic therapy options to control tumor growth and symptoms of hormone hypersecretion&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H330046143\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF THE APPROACH TO LOCAL TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For initial management of patients with hepatic metastases from carcinoid or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (NET) that are resectable with curative intent, resection is appropriate in the absence of extrahepatic metastases, diffuse bilobar involvement, or compromised liver function, particularly for low-volume or symptomatic disease and low-grade tumors. The benefit of surgical debulking in patients with incompletely resectable metastatic carcinoid or pancreatic NETs is controversial, and not universally accepted. (See <a href=\"#H691406\" class=\"local\">'Surgical resection'</a> below.)</p><p>Another point of controversy is whether the primary site should be resected in patients with metastatic disease. For most malignancies, there is little rationale to resect the primary site when widespread, unresectable metastases are present. In patients with carcinoid tumors, however, resection of the primary may be beneficial if the primary site is causing symptoms, even in the setting of metastatic disease, given the sometimes prolonged survival of such patients. Additionally, if the primary and liver metastases are both amenable to potentially curative resection, surgery should be performed. On the other hand, the benefit of resecting asymptomatic small bowel primary sites in patients with unresectable metastatic disease has not been clearly established. (See <a href=\"#H178295679\" class=\"local\">'Management of the primary tumor in patients with metastatic disease'</a> below.)</p><p>The role of ablation (radiofrequency ablation [RFA], cryoablation, microwave ablation) in the therapeutic management of small (&lt;3 cm) neuroendocrine liver metastases, particularly in patients who are eligible for resection, is undefined. Because the majority of patients present with multifocal and bilateral disease, ablation is most often used as an adjunct to surgical resection to allow local treatment of all disease when major hepatectomy alone might compromise residual liver function. (See <a href=\"#H178294546\" class=\"local\">'Ablation'</a> below.)</p><p>For symptomatic patients with hepatic-predominant unresectable carcinoid or pancreatic NET, transarterial therapy with hepatic arterial embolization, chemoembolization, or radioembolization are all potential alternatives to medical therapy alone for symptom palliation. While many studies demonstrate successful control of symptoms related to hormone secretion or tumor bulk, survival benefits from transarterial therapy are less clear. (See <a href=\"#H691449\" class=\"local\">'Hepatic artery embolization'</a> below.)</p><p>Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is not currently a standard option for unresectable neuroendocrine liver metastases, and further investigation is needed to evaluate its benefits for patients with metastatic carcinoid and pancreatic NET. (See <a href=\"#H178295652\" class=\"local\">'Liver transplantation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H691398\"><span class=\"h1\">HEPATIC PREDOMINANT METASTATIC DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of patients with advanced gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) have liver metastases. How to best manage patients with liver metastases from NETs is a complex issue requiring a multidisciplinary team approach, taking into account factors such as the extent and biology of disease, presence of tumor-related symptoms, and patient-related factors such as age and performance status. The role of primary tumor resection in patients with metastatic disease is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H178295679\" class=\"local\">'Management of the primary tumor in patients with metastatic disease'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H691406\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with liver metastases from carcinoid or pancreatic NET, surgical resection is an option in the absence of diffuse bilobar involvement, compromised liver function, or extrahepatic metastases. The presence of high-grade (G3) neuroendocrine carcinoma is also a contraindication to resection.</p><p>Resection of neuroendocrine liver metastases (NELM) via anatomic hepatectomy or multiple nonanatomic &quot;wedge&quot; resections can be performed even with bilobar involvement provided sufficient functional hepatic reserve is preserved, typically over 20 percent of total liver volume and the presence of two contiguous preserved liver segments. The ability of the liver to undergo compensatory hypertrophy is decreased by cirrhosis, hepatitis, or steatosis related to obesity.</p><p>A surgical approach to hepatic predominant disease has traditionally been advised given the limited availability of systemic therapy and the relatively indolent nature of disease. Historical recommendations have supported resection if at least 90 percent of tumor can be feasibly removed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metastatic-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors-local-options-to-control-tumor-growth-and-symptoms-of-hormone-hypersecretion/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, the precise method of measuring 90 percent debulking is not defined, and the precise amount of tumor burden that must be treated for benefit remains unclear. Furthermore, randomized studies comparing hepatic resection versus a nonsurgical approach have not been performed. Finally, the indolent nature of the disease plus the potential for selection bias has complicated the assessment of efficacy of a surgical approach to hepatic predominant disease. Nonetheless, the long-term survival and symptomatic improvement reported in select populations of patients undergoing hepatic resection of neuroendocrine liver metastases compare favorably with outcomes with other management approaches for advanced NETs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F97744\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97744 \">table 2</a>). A few of the largest series are described in detail:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A large early single-institution series included 170 patients undergoing liver resection over a 20-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metastatic-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors-local-options-to-control-tumor-growth-and-symptoms-of-hormone-hypersecretion/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Metastases were bilateral in the majority of patients, and most had hormonal symptoms. Symptom control was achieved in 96 percent of patients who presented with symptoms related to a functioning tumor; five-year symptom recurrence was 59 percent. Overall survival in the group was 61 and 35 percent at 5 and 10 years, respectively, with a median survival of 81 months. These outcomes compare favorably with historical controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metastatic-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors-local-options-to-control-tumor-growth-and-symptoms-of-hormone-hypersecretion/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Of note, recurrence rates were 84 and 95 percent at 5 and 10 years, respectively. Although nearly all patients developed disease recurrence, surgery appeared to offer significant improvements in expected survival.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Others report a lower rate of disease recurrence after hepatic resection, at least at five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metastatic-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors-local-options-to-control-tumor-growth-and-symptoms-of-hormone-hypersecretion/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. As examples:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A second series of 144 patients undergoing resection with or without ablation for neuroendocrine liver metastases over a 30-year period at a single institution described a median overall survival of 9.6 years, with 5 and 10-year survivals of 77 and 50 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metastatic-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors-local-options-to-control-tumor-growth-and-symptoms-of-hormone-hypersecretion/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. While nearly 50 percent of all patients developed recurrence of liver disease, most were able to have further local treatment with repeat resection or ablation. The authors acknowledge the selected nature of the patients undergoing surgical resection, as this number represented only 25 percent of patients with stage IV NETs seen at that institution in the same time frame.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The largest published multi-institutional series of patients undergoing surgery for neuroendocrine liver metastases included 376 patients treated over a 24-year period across 10 hepatobiliary referral centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metastatic-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors-local-options-to-control-tumor-growth-and-symptoms-of-hormone-hypersecretion/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Most presented with bilobar disease, extrahepatic disease was present in 9 percent, and 22 percent of procedures included ablation as a component of the intervention. In the entire cohort, the disease-free survival rate at five years was 46 percent; overall survival was not reported. However, there was a tail to the disease-free survival curve beyond 10 years, suggesting that approximately 35 to 40 percent did not recur during this timeframe. In multivariate analysis, type of NET (pancreatic nonfunctional versus other), grade of tumor differentiation <span class=\"nowrap\">(moderately/poorly</span> versus well), and extent of liver involvement were the only independent predictors of inferior disease-free survival.</p><p/><p>Despite the apparent benefit of surgical resection in terms of symptom palliation and potentially increased survival, most series share a high recurrence rate, even with complete resection and microscopically negative margins. The high rate of intrahepatic recurrence is likely related to an underestimation of the true extent of disease burden with preoperative cross-sectional imaging. In a study comparing preoperative radiology findings with the pathologic review of resected neuroendocrine liver metastases, the extent of disease was underestimated by up to 50 percent, with many additional metastases &lt;2 mm identified in the pathologic specimen that had not been visualized on preoperative imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metastatic-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors-local-options-to-control-tumor-growth-and-symptoms-of-hormone-hypersecretion/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>While surgical resection may benefit highly selected patients, the potential for selection bias in these series and a lack of randomized data have made it difficult to assess the long-term benefits of this approach, as compared with less invasive treatment strategies. One report of a large prospective database of 649 patients with neuroendocrine liver metastases who were followed for a median follow-up of 44 months suggested that hepatic resection was associated with a highly favorable overall survival (90 percent at five years) compared with other local modalities, such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA; 84 percent) and chemoembolization (55 percent), but the potential for selection bias (ie, that surgery was only offered to those patients who had an inherently better tumor biology) complicates interpretation of the results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metastatic-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors-local-options-to-control-tumor-growth-and-symptoms-of-hormone-hypersecretion/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Some authors have attempted to address confounding factors by using propensity index modeling to identify patients with common characteristics for comparative analyses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metastatic-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors-local-options-to-control-tumor-growth-and-symptoms-of-hormone-hypersecretion/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As an example, one report compared outcomes in a series of 339 patients with neuroendocrine liver metastases undergoing surgical therapy with 414 neuroendocrine liver metastases patients undergoing intra-arterial therapy (IAT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metastatic-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors-local-options-to-control-tumor-growth-and-symptoms-of-hormone-hypersecretion/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Patients undergoing IAT had more hormonally functioning tumors, a greater proportion of tumors with synchronous presentation of liver metastases, more extrahepatic metastases, more bilateral disease, a greater extent of hepatic involvement, and less frequently had the primary tumor resected. In the unadjusted analysis, median and five-year survival were, not surprisingly, significantly better for patients undergoing surgery as compared with IAT. Propensity scores matching was used to identify a group of patients with balanced clinicopathologic characteristics who were most likely to have been considered for either treatment. While survival was significantly better in the surgical group in the unadjusted analysis, the propensity-adjusted analysis suggested that surgery was associated with superior outcomes in patients with a low (&lt;25 percent) hepatic disease burden, and in those who were symptomatic and with &gt;25 percent hepatic tumor involvement. There was no treatment-related difference in long-term outcome in asymptomatic patients with &gt;25 percent hepatic tumor involvement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A similar statistical approach was applied to an analysis of 376 patients with neuroendocrine liver metastases from small intestinal carcinoid tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metastatic-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors-local-options-to-control-tumor-growth-and-symptoms-of-hormone-hypersecretion/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In this series, 103 patients undergoing hepatectomy or ablation were compared with 273 patients treated nonsurgically. Patients selected for surgery were less likely to have symptomatic disease, less likely to have residual or unresected extrahepatic disease or nodal metastases, and had lower overall disease burden and lower-grade tumors. In an unadjusted comparison, five-year overall survival was 78 percent after surgery or ablation versus 56 percent in controls.

The most commonly used ablation technique is RFA, but other modalities including cryoablation and microwave ablation can be utilized. These procedures, which can be performed percutaneously, laparoscopically, or at the time of laparotomy, are less morbid than either hepatic resection or hepatic artery embolization. However, because the zone of ablation is limited, ablative techniques may be applicable only to smaller lesions (typically &le;3 cm).</p><p>Many published reports of tumor ablation are small case studies of fewer than 40 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metastatic-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors-local-options-to-control-tumor-growth-and-symptoms-of-hormone-hypersecretion/abstract/13-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-18</a>]. The largest published series examining ablation for neuroendocrine liver metastases included 89 patients undergoing laparoscopic RFA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metastatic-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors-local-options-to-control-tumor-growth-and-symptoms-of-hormone-hypersecretion/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The mean number of lesions treated per patient was six (range 1 to 16) with a mean lesion size of 3.6 cm (range 1 to 10 cm). There was one postoperative death and a 6 percent perioperative morbidity rate, most frequently related to hemorrhage. Among patients with hormonal symptoms (44 percent), significant or complete symptom relief occurred in 73 percent of patients when assessed one week post-procedure and relief was sustained for a median of 14 months. At a median follow-up of 30 months, the median disease-free survival after the first RFA treatment was 16 months with an overall survival of six years. Twenty-two percent of patients developed local liver recurrence, and 59 percent developed extrahepatic disease. Multimodality treatment subsequently was used to control disease, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a> (30 percent), repeat RFA (27 percent), chemoembolization (7 percent), and chemotherapy (18 percent).</p><p>The role of ablation in the therapeutic management of small neuroendocrine liver metastases, particularly in patients who are eligible for resection, is undefined. Because the majority of patients present with multifocal and bilateral disease, a primary role for ablation may be as an adjunct to surgical resection to allow local treatment of all disease when major hepatectomy alone might compromise residual liver function. Ablation may also be particularly useful for patients with intrahepatic disease recurrence in whom surgical options are limited due to prior hepatectomy. The combination of resection and ablation is a well-described strategy for a variety of malignancies. In the series reported by Mayo et al, 66 of 339 (19 percent) patients undergoing liver-directed therapy underwent a combination of resection and ablation at the initial surgical attempt. A smaller number of patients underwent a second liver-directed procedure (n = 46), with increasing use of ablation alone (7 of 46, or 15.2 percent) or resection plus ablation (17 of 46, or 37 percent) during the second procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metastatic-gastroenteropancreatic-neuroendocrine-tumors-local-options-to-control-tumor-growth-and-symptoms-of-hormone-hypersecretion/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H691449\"><span class=\"h3\">Hepatic artery embolization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest hepatic arterial embolization, chemoembolization, or radioembolization as an alternative to medical therapy alone as a palliative technique for symptomatic patients with hepatic-predominant unresectable carcinoid or pancreatic NET.</p><p>Hepatic arterial embolization is frequently applied as a palliative technique in patients with a hepatic-predominant metastatic NET who are not candidates for surgical resection.

(See <a href=\"#H691406\" class=\"local\">'Surgical resection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest resection for symptomatic small bowel primary sites and for asymptomatic primaries if both the primary site and liver metastases are amenable to potentially curative resection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The benefit of resecting asymptomatic small bowel primary sites in patients with unresectable metastatic disease has not been clearly established, and we suggest not pursuing this approach (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
