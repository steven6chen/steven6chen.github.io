Therapies under investigation that may become useful for improving symptoms of claudication to avoid the need for revascularization, promote healing of ischemic ulcers, or alter perception of ischemic pain in patients who are poor candidates or who have failed revascularization attempts are reviewed here. The clinical use of these agents is not yet recommended.</p><p>For patients with claudication, convincing evidence of benefit of pharmacologic agents for improving symptoms is available only for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cilostazol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cilostazol</a> and naftidrofuryl among the myriad of agents that have been evaluated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-treating-symptoms-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. Recommendations for these and other potentially beneficial pharmacologic agents are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-claudication#H50931993\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of claudication&quot;, section on 'Beneficial'</a>.)</p><p>The best therapeutic option for patients with advanced PAD (eg, rest pain, ischemic ulceration, gangrene) is revascularization (percutaneous or surgical). However, many patients are poor candidates for revascularization due to severe medical comorbidities.

Potential future pharmacologic therapies that remain to be proven beneficial for the treatment of symptoms associated with lower extremity peripheral artery disease, including claudication, are presented below in alphabetical order. These therapies may be targeted either to improving symptoms of claudication or to more severe manifestations of ischemia, such as ischemic rest pain, ulceration, or gangrene. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H50943516\"><span class=\"h2\">Antichlamydia therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It has been proposed that chronic Chlamydia pneumoniae infection may promote the development of atherosclerosis, and for peripheral artery disease (PAD), the level of C. pneumoniae antibodies correlates with the severity of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/investigational-therapies-for-treating-symptoms-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-artery-disease/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Studies evaluating symptoms in patients with PAD are conflicting but differing agents have been used.

Amputation-free survival did not significantly differ between the stem-cell treated and the control group. Treatment had beneficial effects on subjective and surrogate endpoints such as pain score, pain-free walking distance, ankle-brachial index, and transcutaneous oxygen measurements.
