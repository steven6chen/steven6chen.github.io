The following brief discussion applies specifically to issues postcesarean delivery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H124488904\"><span class=\"h2\">Maternal monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the immediate postoperative period, vital signs, uterine tone, vaginal and incisional bleeding, and urine output are monitored closely.</p><p>Vital signs that may trigger evaluation for a serious complication following cesarean delivery include systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg, heart rate &gt;120 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/minute,</span> respiratory rate <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;30/minute,</span> oxygen saturation &lt;95 percent, urine output &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">cc/hour</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-postoperative-issues/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Hypo- or hypertension can be signs of intra-abdominal bleeding or preeclampsia, respectively.</p><p>Routine postoperative hemoglobin testing probably unnecessary in asymptomatic patients after planned cesarean delivery without postpartum hemorrhage, as the information does not lead to improved outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-postoperative-issues/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. No studies have evaluated such testing after cesareans performed during labor, but routine evaluation of postdelivery hemoglobin is also probably unnecessary in uncomplicated, stable patients without excessive bleeding at delivery. Nevertheless, providers may routinely check for anemia as a prudent approach.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H124488490\"><span class=\"h2\">Analgesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-perioperative-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute perioperative pain&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-cesarean-delivery#H3731159853\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for cesarean delivery&quot;, section on 'Post-cesarean delivery analgesia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H124488508\"><span class=\"h2\">Bladder catheter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Removing the catheter as soon as possible minimizes the risk of infection. There is no evidence that routine urine culture or a trial of catheter clamping is useful before removal of the bladder catheter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-postoperative-issues/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Although a meta-analysis reported that antibiotic administration prior to catheter removal reduced the rate of catheter-associated urinary tract infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-postoperative-issues/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], there were multiple limitations to these trials. We do not recommend this intervention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=catheter-associated-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Catheter-associated urinary tract infection in adults&quot;, section on 'Prevention'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H124488547\"><span class=\"h2\">Diet and activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early ambulation (when the effects of anesthesia have abated) and oral intake (within six hours of delivery) are encouraged. In a 2013 systematic review (14 randomized trials and 3 nonrandomized trials), early intake of oral fluids or food after cesarean delivery was well tolerated and had no adverse effects on time to bowel <span class=\"nowrap\">action/passing</span> flatus or frequency of nausea, vomiting, paralytic ileus, or analgesic use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-postoperative-issues/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Early oral intake may enhance the return of bowel function by stimulating the gastrocolic reflex. Chewing gum at least three times per day for at least 15 minutes appears to accelerate postoperative gastrointestinal recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-postoperative-issues/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measures-to-prevent-prolonged-postoperative-ileus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measures to prevent prolonged postoperative ileus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Heavy lifting and lifting from a squat position confer the greatest increases in intra-abdominal pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-postoperative-issues/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. These activities should probably be minimized in the first one to two weeks of wound healing, although there are no data regarding the impact of various intra-abdominal pressures on wound healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-postoperative-issues/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Some surgeons suggest that patients avoid lifting &gt;13 pounds (6 kg) from the floor for four to six weeks following abdominal surgery to minimize stress on the healing fascia, but no evidence-based guidelines are available. Some evidence suggests that lifting 20 pounds, climbing stairs, and abdominal crunches generate no more intraabdominal force than rising from a chair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-postoperative-issues/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. There are also data that unsutured fascial wounds achieve 30 to 50 percent of unwounded tissue strength after four to six weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-postoperative-issues/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]; the recovery of sutured wounds may be faster. Many obstetric clinicians advise women to avoid lifting anything heavier than the infant.</p><p>Women may slowly increase aerobic training activities, depending on their level of discomfort and postpartum complications. There is little evidence to support specific recommendations for aerobic and strength-training activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-postoperative-issues/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Pelvic floor muscle exercises can reduce urinary incontinence, if present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-urinary-incontinence-in-women#H16614557\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of urinary incontinence in women&quot;, section on 'Pelvic floor muscle (Kegel) exercises'</a>.)</p><p>Women should avoid driving if they are taking opioids or other sedatives or if they have pain with the normal activities required of a driver (eg, turning the body or head, stepping on the <span class=\"nowrap\">brake/accelerator,</span> steering).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H124488553\"><span class=\"h2\">Breastfeeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breastfeeding can be initiated in the delivery room. The usual <span class=\"nowrap\">drugs/procedures</span> associated with cesarean birth are not a contraindication to breastfeeding. Information about use of drugs during breastfeeding is available in the UpToDate drug database and at the <a href=\"http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/newtoxnet/lactmed.htm&amp;token=uFbFTjFpzLQOPfYhN9e/pQnyw7Zq325jclNuEZrgvWE5qEDXC8BYslQiUWuTXChFpW6XZtKFqw8EFQSCTVAGmQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=4459\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">LactMed</a> drugs and lactation database.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H124488932\"><span class=\"h2\">Wound care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a clean surgical wound, epithelialization typically occurs in the 48 hours after surgery. The superficial layer of epithelium creates a barrier to bacteria and other foreign bodies. However, it is very thin, easily traumatized, and gives little tensile strength.</p><p>Although data from randomized trials are limited, removal of dressings from clean or clean, contaminated surgical wounds within 48 hours of surgery (ie, the period of epithelization) appears to have no detrimental effect on outcomes, compared with removal after 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-postoperative-issues/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A trial involving 320 patients who underwent scheduled cesarean delivery reported no detrimental effects from dressing removal at six versus 24 hours post-surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-postoperative-issues/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. We usually remove the dressing &le;24 hours after cesarean. There is no conclusive evidence of harm from postoperative showering within 48 hours of surgery in patients with closed surgical&nbsp;wounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-postoperative-issues/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>We typically reapproximate the skin with an absorbable subcuticular suture (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cesarean-delivery-surgical-technique#H33\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cesarean delivery: Surgical technique&quot;, section on 'Skin closure'</a>). If staples are used (eg, patient&rsquo;s preference based on prior experience), we remove them four or more days postoperatively, if the skin incision was transverse. We would consider keeping the staples in longer (eg, up to 10 days postoperatively) in women with risk factors for wound complications, such as those with diabetes mellitus or obesity. If a vertical incision was performed, the staples are left in place for at least five to seven days, and longer in a patient at high risk of wound complications, since there is more tension on the skin edges of a vertical incision. Adhesive strips may be applied after removal of the staples to help keep the wound edges approximated. In patients who scar easily, the scar that results from staples may be more pronounced than one produced by sutures, particularly if the staples are left in place for prolonged periods (&gt;5 to 15 days, depending upon the location).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major non-anesthesia-related complications related to cesarean delivery are endometritis, wound complications, hemorrhage, injury to pelvic organs, and thromboembolic disorders. The risk of severe maternal morbidity is generally higher in women with an unplanned cesarean delivery during labor than in those with a scheduled prelabor cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-postoperative-issues/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Cesarean delivery in the second stage of labor is generally associated with higher maternal composite morbidity than cesarean delivery in the first stage of labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-postoperative-issues/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>Data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample showed that 76 in 1000 cesarean deliveries (97 in 1000 primary and 48 in 1000 repeat cesarean deliveries) were associated with at least one of 12 complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-postoperative-issues/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Absolute complication rates vary widely across hospitals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-postoperative-issues/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] and by patient risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-postoperative-issues/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], and complications related to placenta accreta are a particular concern in women undergoing repeat cesarean delivery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-placenta-accreta-spectrum-placenta-accreta-increta-and-percreta\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of placenta accreta spectrum (placenta accreta, increta, and percreta)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Endometritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a review of Maternal-Fetal Medicine Units (MFMU) Network prospective studies of cesarean delivery (n = 70,000 cesareans), the rate of endometritis was 6 percent of primary cesarean deliveries without labor and 11 percent of cesarean deliveries during labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-postoperative-issues/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of postpartum endometritis are discussed in detail separately.

A meta-analysis of nonrandomized studies found that implementing an evidence-based bundle lowered the rate of surgical site infection (pooled rate 6 percent at baseline versus 2 percent after the intervention, relative risk 0.33, 95% CI 0.25-0.43, number needed to treat = 24) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-postoperative-issues/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The bundles varied but included at least three of the following: antibiotic prophylaxis, use of clippers rather than razors, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a> skin preparation, enhancements to aseptic surgical technique, spontaneous placental removal with gentle traction, patient and staff education initiatives, and skin closure specifications. Unscheduled cesarean delivery is a major risk factor for wound complications, even when evidence-based interventions to reduce postcesarean delivery wound complications have been administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-postoperative-issues/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In one study, 28 percent of such patients had a wound complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-postoperative-issues/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>Wound infection generally develops four to seven days after the cesarean. Risk factors include obesity, chorioamnionitis, blood transfusion, anticoagulation therapy, alcohol or drug misuse, second stage cesarean delivery, and subcutaneous hematoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-postoperative-issues/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p>Early wound infections (in the first 24 to 48 hours) are usually due to group A or B beta-hemolytic <em>Streptococcus</em> and are characterized by high fever and cellulitis. Later infections are more likely to be due to <em>Staphylococcus epidermidis </em>or <em>aureus</em>, <em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Proteus mirabilis</em>, or cervicovaginal flora [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-postoperative-issues/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p>The basic principles of wound management (role of antibiotics, debridement, topical therapy, dressings, packing, negative pressure, management of disruption) are reviewed in detail separately.

This rate was 20-fold higher than the rate one year later and significantly higher than the rate after vaginal delivery (165 per 100,000).

A significant proportion of the surgical mortality (and morbidity) of cesarean delivery is related to the underlying medical and obstetrical factors that necessitate the surgical delivery.

Estimates of the frequency of pathologic or prolonged ileus after cesarean delivery are imprecise because ileus is a normal physiologic response to abdominopelvic surgery, definitions of pathologic or prolonged ileus differ, and multiple factors affect the risk of occurrence. Clinical findings, diagnosis, management, and prevention of postoperative ileus are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postoperative-ileus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postoperative ileus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Severe postoperative ileus after cesarean delivery may be related to acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (Ogilvie's syndrome), which is characterized by gross dilatation of the cecum and right hemicolon in the absence of an anatomic obstruction.

The two entities share common inflammatory pathogenic mechanisms and often occur together, but may differ in their clinical presentations and diagnostic findings. Patients with OVT usually present with fever and abdominal pain&nbsp;localized to the side of the affected vein within one week after delivery or surgery; thrombosis of the right ovarian vein is visualized radiographically in approximately 20 percent of cases. Patients with DSPT usually present within a few days after delivery or surgery with fever that persists despite antibiotics, in the absence of radiographic evidence of thrombosis. Abdominal or pelvic tenderness is notably absent.

Some women also express strong feelings of loss, failure, and anger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-postoperative-issues/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. These feelings are likely related, at least in part, to the anxiety associated with medical and obstetrical complications necessitating abdominal delivery (especially unplanned abdominal delivery); the stress, pain, and fatigue associated with major surgery; and the psychological status of the parturient. Better psychological outcomes may be realized by realistic preparation for childbirth, maternal involvement in decision making, and attention to the specific needs of the woman who is both postpartum and postoperative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-postoperative-issues/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal and neonatal risks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although cesarean delivery is usually performed for the benefit of the fetus, the fetus is also at risk from cesarean birth. Risks include iatrogenic prematurity and birth trauma; the latter occurs in 1 to 3 percent of cesareans and consists mostly of mild lacerations related to emergency delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-postoperative-issues/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Transient tachypnea of the newborn (TTN) is more common after scheduled cesarean birth, probably because exposure to labor initiates processes that enhance reabsorption of lung fluid. In a review of 29,669 deliveries, the incidence of TTN was approximately threefold higher after planned cesarean than after vaginal delivery (3.1 versus 1.1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-postoperative-issues/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Cesarean delivery has also been reported to be a modest risk factor for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), particularly if the cesarean was performed in a nonlaboring patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-postoperative-issues/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

Adhesions can be completely asymptomatic or can cause significant morbidity and mortality related to bowel obstruction, infertility, or organ injury during repeat abdominal surgery. Formation of adhesions is common after cesarean delivery, and the extent and density increase with increasing numbers of repeat cesarean deliveries: the reported prevalence of adhesions is 12 to 46 percent of women at their second cesarean and 26 to 75 percent of women at their third cesarean [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-postoperative-issues/abstract/60-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-65</a>], but the risk of small bowel obstruction is much lower [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-postoperative-issues/abstract/66-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-68</a>].

The absolute risk difference was 0.1 percent; therefore, 1000 cesarean deliveries would need to be avoided to prevent one additional antepartum stillbirth. The analysis excluded the largest published study, which included almost 1.8 million singleton second births in women with no underlying medical conditions and fetuses with no structural or chromosomal abnormalities and found no association between previous cesarean and future term fetal demise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-postoperative-issues/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. This study was excluded from the analysis because it included intrapartum stillbirths, which may have a different etiology. In this study, the fetal death rates at term in those with and without a previous cesarean delivery were 0.7 and 0.8 per 1000 births, respectively. In the entire cohort of over 11 million singleton births (second and subsequent births), the fetal death rates at term for women with and without a previous cesarean were 0.4 and 0.6 per 1000 births, respectively. </p><p>An association between unexplained stillbirth and a prior cesarean delivery observed in some studies may be due to residual confounding, but it is possible that scar tissue from a previous cesarean delivery may lead to abnormal placental function leading to stillbirth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Subfertility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a 2013 systematic review including 18 cohort studies and almost 600,000 women, women who underwent a cesarean delivery had 10 percent fewer subsequent pregnancies than women who delivered vaginally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-postoperative-issues/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. A 2018 meta-analysis described a 60 percent increase in subfertility among women who underwent cesarean delivery versus vaginal birth (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.45-1.76), but subfertility was not defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cesarean-delivery-postoperative-issues/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].
