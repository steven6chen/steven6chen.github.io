However, it has been associated with the development of both acute and chronic kidney failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparative-regimens-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preparative regimens for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The term &quot;hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot; will be used throughout this review as a general term to cover transplantation of progenitor cells from any source (eg, bone marrow, peripheral blood, cord blood). Otherwise, the source of such cells will be specified (eg, autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sources of hematopoietic stem cells&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although the requirement for dialysis following HCT is relatively uncommon (in the range of 2 to 5 percent), it is generally associated with an extremely poor prognosis. However, acute kidney injury (AKI), as defined by doubling or smaller increases in the serum creatinine concentration, is common, approaching 50 to 60 percent in several reports. There are a variety of causes of AKI following HCT and several risk factors that are associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In the majority of patients, renal dysfunction is temporary and returns to baseline; however, adjusting medications to avoid further damage is common.</p><p>This topic will review the epidemiology and causes of kidney injury following HCT other than sepsis or drug-induced acute tubular necrosis or tumor lysis syndrome. These include hepatic sinusoidal obstructive syndrome (SOS, formerly known as veno-occlusive disease), hemolytic-uremic syndrome or thrombotic microangiopathy, and calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity. The technique and other complications associated with HCT are discussed separately.

However, the incidence of AKI following HCT may be decreasing. In a retrospective review of over 2500 HCT recipients from the same center, the incidence of a doubling of serum creatinine was significantly lower during the period of 2003 through 2007 compared with 1993 through 1997 (33 versus 50 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H66480158\"><span class=\"h3\">Type of regimen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of AKI associated with HCT depends in part upon the specific procedure used, with myeloablative regimens associated with a higher incidence of AKI compared with nonmyeloablative regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>] and allogeneic regimens associated with a higher risk than autologous regimens.

In one study, the risk of AKI with a myeloablative regimen was nearly fivefold higher than the risk with a nonmyeloablative regimen after accounting for age and other comorbid conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H66480165\"><span class=\"h3\">Prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Renal failure requiring dialysis in the peritransplant period has a poor prognosis due, in part, to its association with coexistent injury of multiple other organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/4,7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7-9</a>]. In one study of 88 patients who underwent allogeneic HCT, the requirement for dialysis was associated with an 83 percent mortality, with patients dying an average of 47 days posttransplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, the majority of patients who have AKI and do not require dialysis recover.</p><p>A 2005 meta-analysis of six published reports of myeloablative allogeneic transplantation noted a twofold increased risk of death with AKI (defined as doubling of the serum creatinine concentration) and a sevenfold increased risk of death with AKI requiring dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Mortality rates associated with AKI vary by modality and have been reported to be 54, 48, and 11 percent at 1000 days after autologous, myeloablative allogeneic, and nonmyeloablative allogeneic HCT, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology of chronic kidney disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a wide range in the reported incidence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) following HCT (0 to over 60 percent at &ge;6 months following HCT); this is related in part to variations in the definition of CKD, duration of follow-up, and type of HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].</p><p>Radiation therapy has been implicated, possibly by causing a subacute or chronic thrombotic microangiopathy (radiation nephritis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/14-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-19</a>]. The likelihood of developing CKD varies with the radiation dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. This was suggested in a review of 11 studies in which CKD was rare when the total radiation dose to the kidney was &lt;17 Gy; most patients who developed CKD received &gt;20 Gy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

This was suggested in a report of 60 patients who underwent HCT, in which 34 (57 percent) had at least a 20 percent fall in GFR at a mean follow-up of two years; this was mostly seen in patients who underwent TBI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, the mean GFR after TBI was still &gt;80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> (compared with 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> among patients who did not receive TBI).</p><p>A similar benign outcome was noted in a review of patients receiving TBI (estimated renal dose 12 Gy) in which only 2 of 33 surviving patients had persistent elevations in serum creatinine 24 months after HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Factors other than TBI can contribute to the development of CKD. This was illustrated in a series of 122 patients who underwent nonmyeloablative HCT (with only 2 Gy of radiation given); 81 patients (66 percent) had a &ge;25 percent reduction in GFR at six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Plasma exchange has been tried in selected patients with generally disappointing results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/3,35,37,46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,35,37,46,47</a>]. The lack of efficacy of plasma exchange may be due to the fact that thrombotic microangiopathy following HCT is due to direct injury to the kidney from drugs or radiation and that deficiency of the ADAMTS-13 protease, which is present in acquired, autoimmune TTP, is not involved in the pathogenesis of thrombotic microangiopathy after HCT. Since thrombotic microangiopathy is often associated with calcineurin toxicity, discontinuation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> is essential.

In addition, the microangiopathy appears to be primarily limited to the kidney since systemic thrombotic microangiopathy was not identified at autopsy in the review cited above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Instead, supportive care and withdrawal of calcineurin inhibitors, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> A, are the mainstays of therapy.

Studies suggest that the risk of this condition may be minimized by shielding the kidneys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>], by fractionating the TBI over several days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/18,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,30</a>], and by replacing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> with other types of chemotherapeutic drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Vigorous hydration is also likely important.</p><p>Studies in animal models of radiation nephritis and bone marrow transplantation nephropathy suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors may be effective for both prevention and treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-53</a>]. The applicability of these findings to humans is uncertain, but it seems prudent to preferentially use an ACE inhibitor in patients who become hypertensive.

The early renal vasoconstriction induced by these agents is markedly enhanced by concurrent therapy with amphotericin B, and a temporary reduction in dose or cessation of therapy may be indicated if AKI occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

As an example, in one series of 163 patients who underwent HCT, nephrotic syndrome developed in seven (4.3 percent) a median of 300 days after HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. A variety of histologic patterns have been reported; the most common are membranous nephropathy (MN) followed by minimal change disease (MCD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/11,57,58,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,57,58,63</a>]. This was illustrated in a literature review of 42 well-documented cases: 60 percent had MN, and 22 percent had MCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>The occurrence of MN is often associated with a decrease in immunosuppression and, therefore, with an increased likelihood of GVHD.

In the above literature review, nephrotic syndrome was diagnosed 8 to 14 months following HCT, and all 42 cases occurred within two months following the diagnosis of GVHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>Remission frequently occurs upon reinitiation of immunosuppressive drugs (corticosteroids, in particular) or anti-B cell therapy (anti-CD20, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>], but some do progress to ESRD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].

The requirement for dialysis for acute kidney injury (AKI) occurring in the peritransplant period is an ominous event since it typically occurs in association with injury to multiple other organs.

By comparison, with an allograft that is foreign to donated marrow cells, antirejection therapy is still required, but perhaps at lower doses since reconstituted marrow may not be fully functional [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Combined hematopoietic cell and kidney transplant has also resulted in the development of tolerance to the transplanted kidney and withdrawal of immunosuppressive medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/kidney-disease-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18740749\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
