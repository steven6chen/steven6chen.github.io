There are several possible mechanisms involved, including acquired abnormalities involving clotting factors and the coagulation cascade, extrinsic vessel compression by tumor masses, immobility, surgery, the presence of indwelling central venous catheters, as well as the simultaneous presence of an inherited hypercoagulable state (eg, factor V Leiden). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-and-prevention-of-venous-thromboembolism-in-adults-with-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk and prevention of venous thromboembolism in adults with cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-the-hypercoagulable-state-associated-with-malignancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of the hypercoagulable state associated with malignancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with multiple myeloma (MM) or the precursor lesion monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) have an increased incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE). In addition, a few studies have suggested an increased risk of arterial thromboembolism (ATE) in these populations as manifested by stroke, transient ischemic attack, myocardial infarction, or symptomatic peripheral artery disease. The increased rate of VTE appears to be both a result of the malignancy itself and the therapy given. In particular, the rate of VTE is particularly high for patients with MM treated with combination chemotherapy that contains <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thalidomide</a> or a thalidomide analog such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a>.</p><p>The thrombotic risk associated with the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thalidomide</a> and its analogues as treatment for MM will be discussed here.

All three options lowered the incidence of VTE to less than 5 percent compared with an expected rate of more than 20 percent. It is unknown how these regimens would compare with VTE prophylaxis with therapeutic adjusted-dose warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) or therapeutic dose LMWH. Use of aspirin is simpler and less expensive than LMWH. Of importance, these trials excluded patients thought to be at higher risk of thromboembolic events due to a history of VTE, severe cardiac disease, immobilization, uncontrolled diabetes, recent surgery, or ongoing infections. Such patients should be considered for more intensive VTE prophylaxis. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Thalidomide-based therapy'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H642162830\"><span class=\"h3\">High risk setting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients receiving immunomodulatory drugs who have two or more risk factors or are receiving concomitant high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> (&ge;480 mg per month), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, or multiagent chemotherapy are considered at higher risk of VTE. The ideal agent for VTE prophylaxis in this setting is unknown and clinical practice varies widely. For patients at higher risk of VTE treated with thalidomide-, lenalidomide-, or pomalidomide-containing therapy, we suggest the use of prophylactic dose of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or therapeutic anticoagulation with either LMWH or adjusted-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>. This preference is largely based upon the data suggesting efficacy of full dose warfarin and LMWH and the uncertainty of the efficacy of aspirin in this setting. The choice of prophylactic LMWH versus full anticoagulation in this setting may be based in part on the patient&rsquo;s risk for bleeding complications (see <a href=\"#H642162838\" class=\"local\">'Patients at high risk of bleeding'</a> below).</p><p>The choice between LMWH and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> is made based upon the clinical circumstances.

In contrast, warfarin might be preferred in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate below 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span>. If LMWH (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enoxaparin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enoxaparin</a>) is given in this setting, dose reduction is suggested. </p><p>There have been no randomized trials comparing VTE prophylaxis strategies in this higher risk population.

Such methods may be considered for hospitalized patients at standard or high risk of VTE who are also at high risk of complications from bleeding on anticoagulation.

If there have been no further VTE episodes while receiving thalidomide or lenalidomide plus therapeutic anticoagulation, we suggest that anticoagulation be stopped one month after these agents have been discontinued, provided that the patient has been receiving therapeutic anticoagulation for a minimum of three months. This differs somewhat from general recommendations related to the duration of anticoagulation for VTE in cancer patients, in which longer (or indefinite) anticoagulation is common. Since stoppage of the immunomodulatory drug modifies the overall VTE risk of the patient, we feel that indefinite anticoagulation should be considered only in myeloma patients who have recurrent VTE.
