There is no agreement as to the optimal time to initiate adjuvant chemotherapy.

Adjuvant colon cancer trials typically mandate initiation of chemotherapy within six to eight weeks of resection, and this has become an accepted approach.</p><p>In clinical practice, the interval between surgery and initiation of chemotherapy is often longer than eight weeks; the reasons are often multifactorial, but the dominant reason is delayed recovery from surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-stage-iii-node-positive-colon-cancer/abstract/12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-16</a>]. A major advantage of laparoscopic as compared with open resection is its association with earlier initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-stage-iii-node-positive-colon-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

There are no randomized trials addressing this issue in patients with resected colon cancer. Several retrospective studies are available, most of which consist predominantly or exclusively of patients with stage III disease, and only one of which included patients receiving an oxaliplatin-based regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-stage-iii-node-positive-colon-cancer/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In general, the data are conflicting, with four reports suggesting a worse overall and event-free survival (EFS) with a delay beyond eight weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-stage-iii-node-positive-colon-cancer/abstract/16,20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,20-22</a>], one a worse overall survival with delay beyond 12 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-stage-iii-node-positive-colon-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], another suggesting worse overall survival but no impact on EFS with a delay beyond 60 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-stage-iii-node-positive-colon-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], and another, no impact on either disease-free survival (DFS) or overall survival from a delay beyond 45 or 56 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-stage-iii-node-positive-colon-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In adjuvant therapy trials in which time between surgery and initiation of chemotherapy has been examined as a prognostic factor for outcome, delay beyond six to eight weeks has not been associated with inferior outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-stage-iii-node-positive-colon-cancer/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>].</p><p>The adverse impact of delaying chemotherapy beyond eight weeks has been addressed in two meta-analyses:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One meta-analysis consisted of eight studies that compared outcomes among patients with colon or rectal cancer who had delayed chemotherapy compared with those who started within eight weeks of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-stage-iii-node-positive-colon-cancer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Delay of chemotherapy beyond eight weeks was associated with a significantly higher risk of death (relative risk 1.20, 95% CI 1.15-1.26), although relapse-free survival (RFS) was not significantly affected. This suggests that most of the mortality was from surgery-related complications and not cancer related.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The second meta-analysis included 10 studies (one randomized trial, and nine <span class=\"nowrap\">cohort/population-based</span> studies) totaling over 15,000 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-stage-iii-node-positive-colon-cancer/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. A four-week delay in the time to administer adjuvant chemotherapy beyond eight weeks was associated with a significant increase in mortality (hazard ratio [HR] for death 1.14, 95% CI 1.10-1.17) and disease relapse (HR 1.14, 95% CI 1.10-1.18).</p><p/><p>These data support the conclusion that adjuvant chemotherapy should be started within eight weeks of surgery, if at all possible. Delay beyond two months may compromise the effectiveness of chemotherapy, but it is unknown whether there is any cutoff point beyond which the benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy are lost.</p><p>Importantly, both of these analyses included only trials of adjuvant fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy. Whether this recommendation applies to oxaliplatin-based regimens (which are preferred for most patients with stage III tumors) is unclear. (See <a href=\"#H4192015397\" class=\"local\">'Oxaliplatin-based therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>This issue was addressed in a population-based analysis of 635 patients with stage III colon cancer derived from the database of the British Columbia Cancer Agency who initiated adjuvant chemotherapy with FU or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capecitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capecitabine</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a> between 2006 and 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-stage-iii-node-positive-colon-cancer/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The median time from surgery to initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy was 8.3 weeks. At a median follow-up of 57.9 months, five-year relapse-free survival (RFS) was 70.9 percent for those patients who initiated adjuvant chemotherapy within eight weeks and 72.1 percent for those who started after eight weeks.</p><p>Despite these data, we still suggest that adjuvant chemotherapy be started within eight weeks of surgery, if at all possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1725562045\"><span class=\"h1\">DURATION OF THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal duration of adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with stage III colon cancer is evolving. Based upon the MOSAIC and NSABP C-07 trials and preliminary results from the International Duration Evaluation of Adjuvant Chemotherapy (IDEA) collaboration (six randomized trials of six versus three months of oxaliplatin-based adjuvant therapy) reported at the 2017 annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), we continue to suggest six months of oxaliplatin-based therapy for individuals with high-risk cancers (T4, N2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111438\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438 \">table 1</a>)). On the other hand, given the small predicted loss of disease-free survival (DFS) benefit (absolute difference 0.9 percent at three years) and the significantly lower rates of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a> neuropathy, it seems reasonable to limit adjuvant therapy to three months in patients with low-risk disease (T1-3, N1), which makes up approximately 60 percent of all stage III colon cancers. However, the data from the IDEA collaboration are preliminary, and overall survival results are not yet mature. In the interim, patients with lower-risk stage III cancers who place a high value on minimizing their risk of a disease recurrence may still choose six months of adjuvant therapy, with oxaliplatin doses modified based upon neurotoxicity. If three months of adjuvant therapy is chosen, a subset analysis of the IDEA collaboration suggests that oxaliplatin plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capecitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capecitabine</a> may be a better choice than oxaliplatin plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a> and short-term infusional <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> (FOLFOX; although this was not a randomized comparison in any of the six trials), and it avoids the need for an ambulatory infusion pump.</p><p>For patients receiving a non-oxaliplatin-based regimen (ie, a fluoropyrimidine alone), six months of adjuvant therapy remains the standard approach.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2668659669\"><span class=\"h2\">Oxaliplatin-based therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Six months of oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy has been the standard of care for adjuvant treatment of stage III colon cancer. However, given the cumulative and dose-limiting peripheral neuropathy associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a> (13 percent grade 3 neuropathy with six months of FOLFOX in the MOSAIC trial, discussed below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-stage-iii-node-positive-colon-cancer/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]), a shorter duration of therapy might be advantageous if equally effective. (See <a href=\"#H4192015397\" class=\"local\">'Oxaliplatin-based therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Three versus six months of oxaliplatin-based adjuvant therapy was compared in six international concurrently conducted randomized trials, outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113633\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113633 \">table 2</a>); preliminary results from three of the trials were presented at the 2017 annual meeting of ASCO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-stage-iii-node-positive-colon-cancer/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>], as was a preplanned pooled analysis of all six trials (the IDEA collaboration) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-stage-iii-node-positive-colon-cancer/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. A preliminary report of the Japanese ACHIEVE trial was presented at the 2016 annual ASCO meeting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-stage-iii-node-positive-colon-cancer/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. All of the trials and the pooled analysis were powered for noninferiority of three as compared with six months of chemotherapy, with the choice of oxaliplatin-capecitabine <span class=\"nowrap\">(CAPOX/XELOX)</span> or FOLFOX chosen by the individual clinicians. In the pooled analysis, the upper limit of the noninferiority margin was set to no more than a 12 percent relative risk increase in disease recurrence (ie, hazard ratio [HR] for the upper 95% CI less than 1.12).</p><p>In a preliminary analysis of 12,834 patients with stage III disease enrolled in all six trials from 12 countries, presented at the 2017 ASCO meeting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-stage-iii-node-positive-colon-cancer/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], the incidence of grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity was significantly higher with six as compared with three months of treatment (16 versus 3 percent with FOLFOX, 9 versus 3 percent with CAPOX). At a median follow-up of 39 months, the three-year DFS for three versus six months of treatment was 74.6 versus 75.5 percent (HR for disease recurrence 1.07, 95% CI 1.00-1.15). As such, noninferiority was not established for the entire cohort. However, in a preplanned subgroup analysis, noninferiority of three versus six months of therapy was supported for patients receiving the CAPOX regimen (40 percent of the analyzed patients; three- versus six-month HR for recurrence 0.95, 95% CI 0.85-1.06) and for earlier substages of disease (T1-3, N1 disease, DFS 83.1 versus 83.3 percent, HR for recurrence 1.01, 95% CI 0.9-1.12). In contrast, HR for recurrence for three versus six months of treatment for T4 or N2 disease was 1.12. An important point is that although three-year DFS is a validated surrogate endpoint for overall survival in the adjuvant setting, longer-term data are needed to show the robustness of these results.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2915962048\"><span class=\"h2\">Fluoropyrimidine therapy alone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At least three randomized trials have shown no added benefit from 12 as compared with 6 to 8 months of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/leucovorin-containing</span> adjuvant chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-stage-iii-node-positive-colon-cancer/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>].

The benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy have been most clearly demonstrated in stage III (node-positive) disease (an approximately 30 percent reduction in the risk of disease recurrence and a 22 to 32 percent reduction in mortality), whereas benefit in stage II disease remains controversial. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend adjuvant systemic therapy after resection of stage III colon cancer (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). If possible, chemotherapy should be initiated within six to eight weeks of surgery. (See <a href=\"#H405297564\" class=\"local\">'Timing of adjuvant therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend an oxaliplatin-based regimen rather than bolus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> (FU) plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a> (LV) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capecitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capecitabine</a> for patients who are likely to tolerate <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4192015397\" class=\"local\">'Oxaliplatin-based therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When an <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a> regimen is chosen, we prefer FOLFOX (oxaliplatin plus LV and short-term infusional FU) for most patients. While FOLFOX4 was used in the adjuvant registration trials, many American oncologists use modified FOLFOX6 (mFOLFOX6) because it does not require the day 2 bolus of FU and LV (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F50132\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50132 \">table 3</a>). Modified FOLFOX7 (mFOLFOX7 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F55829\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55829 \">table 5</a>)), which eliminates bolus FU completely, is significantly less myelosuppressive.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Oxaliplatin</a> plus oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capecitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capecitabine</a> (XELOX (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F61781\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61781 \">table 4</a>)) is an acceptable, albeit potentially more toxic, alternative to FOLFOX. Patients receiving capecitabine in the adjuvant setting should probably avoid concomitant use of a proton pump inhibitor due to concerns about capecitabine absorption. (See <a href=\"#H4184447927\" class=\"local\">'Capecitabine plus oxaliplatin'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-protocols-for-small-and-large-bowel-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment protocols for small and large bowel cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The optimal duration of adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a> chemotherapy for patients with stage III colon cancer is evolving. Based upon the MOSAIC and NSABP C-07 trials and an early analysis of the International Duration Evaluation of Adjuvant Chemotherapy (IDEA) collaboration (six separate randomized trials of six versus three months of adjuvant oxaliplatin-based therapy) reported at the 2017 annual American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting, we continue to suggest six months of therapy for individuals with high-risk cancers (T4, N2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111438\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438 \">table 1</a>)) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). On the other hand, given the small predicted loss of disease-free survival (DFS) benefit (three-year DFS 83.1 versus 83.3 percent, absolute difference 0.2 percent) and the significantly lower rates of oxaliplatin neuropathy seen in the preliminary IDEA analysis, it seems reasonable to limit adjuvant therapy to three months in patients with low-risk disease (T1-3, N1).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, these data are preliminary, and overall survival results are not mature. In the interim, patients with low-risk disease who place a high value on minimizing their risk of a disease recurrence may still choose six months of adjuvant therapy, with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a> doses adjusted based upon neurotoxicity, and patients with higher-risk disease who place a higher value on avoiding neurotoxicity may choose three months of therapy if they are willing to accept a small potential detriment in DFS. If three months of adjuvant therapy is chosen, a subset analysis of the IDEA collaboration suggests that oxaliplatin plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capecitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capecitabine</a> may be a better choice than FOLFOX (although this was not a randomized comparison in any of the six trials), and it avoids the need for an ambulatory infusion pump. (See <a href=\"#H2668659669\" class=\"local\">'Oxaliplatin-based therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a contraindication to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a> (eg, preexisting neuropathy) or who are considered unlikely to tolerate oxaliplatin, a fluoropyrimidine-alone regimen is an acceptable option, although outcomes may not be as favorable. Furthermore, this approach is best reserved for patients with microsatellite stable (ie, mismatch repair [MMR] enzyme proficient) tumors given the resistance to adjuvant fluoropyrimidines in those with microsatellite unstable (ie, MMR deficient) colon cancers. Our preferred regimens are six months of short-term infusional <span class=\"nowrap\">FU/LV</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F65525\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65525 \">table 7</a>), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capecitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capecitabine</a>, or where available, oral UFT (uracil and tegafur), with or without LV, or S-1. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Choice of regimen'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-protocols-for-small-and-large-bowel-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment protocols for small and large bowel cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Oral fluoropyrimidines'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients who have tumors with high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI-H) or deficiency in one or more MMR enzymes, we suggest not using fluoropyrimidines alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Despite the lack of data from prospective randomized trials, retrospective reports suggest that the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a> to FU can overcome fluoropyrimidine chemoresistance. However, given that many of these patients are being considered for a fluoropyrimidine alone because they are deemed unlikely to tolerate an oxaliplatin-based regimen, decision making must be individualized. One option for patients with MMR deficient tumors who are felt unlikely to tolerate an oxaliplatin-based regimen is to start with half-dose oxaliplatin (as was done in the FOCUS2 trial conducted in patients with metastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-stage-iii-node-positive-colon-cancer/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]) and escalate as permitted by treatment-related toxicity.
