Patients with concomitant cerebrovascular and coronary heart disease represent a subset with advanced atherosclerosis in whom other areas of the arterial system are also involved. In addition to a higher risk of perioperative stroke (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> below), these patients also have a higher incidence of left main coronary disease and a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction compared with patients who have isolated coronary heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-grafting-in-patients-with-cerebrovascular-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>This topic will focus mainly on coexistent coronary and extracranial carotid atherosclerosis. Issues that will be discussed include the management of the patient with an asymptomatic carotid stenosis undergoing CABG, the role of combined or staged CABG and carotid revascularization in these patients, and which strategies will result in the lowest operative morbidity and mortality.</p><p>The indications for CABG are discussed elsewhere.

The available data, summarized below, suggest that unilateral asymptomatic carotid stenosis of 50 to 99 percent is not an independent risk factor for ipsilateral ischemic stroke with CABG. In contrast, certain groups of patients with carotid artery disease appear to have an increased risk of stroke with CABG, including the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic carotid stenosis of 50 to 99 percent in men and 70 to 99 percent in women</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bilateral asymptomatic stenosis of 80 to 99 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unilateral asymptomatic stenosis of 70 to 99 percent and contralateral carotid occlusion</p><p/><p>However, the quality of the data is generally poor, since most studies are single-center, nonrandomized, and retrospective:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2011 meta-analysis demonstrated that the risk of perioperative stroke after cardiac surgery was approximately 7 percent in those with &ge;50 percent carotid stenosis and 9 percent in those with &ge;80 percent stenosis, higher than the described rate of 1.6 to 3 percent in the general population undergoing surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-grafting-in-patients-with-cerebrovascular-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The main stroke predictors were symptomatic carotid stenosis and bilateral carotid <span class=\"nowrap\">stenosis/occlusion,</span> as exclusion of patients with prior <span class=\"nowrap\">stroke/TIA</span> or those with complete occlusion of the carotid decreased the stroke risk to approximately 4 percent in the setting of 50 to 99 percent stenosis and 3 percent with 70 to 99 percent stenosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of a recently symptomatic carotid artery stenosis probably increases the risk of a postoperative stroke in patients undergoing CABG, but there are few data directly addressing this question. In one study, 28 patients with prior symptomatic unilateral carotid disease did not undergo prophylactic carotid endarterectomy, and ischemic stroke occurred in 4 (14 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-grafting-in-patients-with-cerebrovascular-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, only one of the four strokes was attributed to ipsilateral carotid stenosis and was therefore potentially preventable by prophylactic carotid revascularization.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymptomatic carotid stenosis is not a proven independent risk factor for ipsilateral carotid territory ischemic stroke in patients having CABG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-grafting-in-patients-with-cerebrovascular-disease/abstract/12,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,21</a>]. The following represents a summary of the range of findings that have been noted in individual reports:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>One retrospective study of patients with preoperative carotid duplex ultrasound having CABG compared 117 patients who had severe asymptomatic carotid stenosis (&ge;75 percent) with 761 patients who did not have severe carotid stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-grafting-in-patients-with-cerebrovascular-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Both groups had similar rates of in-hospital stroke (3.4 versus 3.6) and mortality (3.4 versus 4.2 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In another retrospective report, there were 18 patients with &ge;50 percent carotid stenosis who had a perioperative ischemic stroke, but only 4 occurred in the territory of the stenotic or occluded carotid artery, and in 3 of these, the carotid was totally occluded on preoperative evaluation and not amenable to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-grafting-in-patients-with-cerebrovascular-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Thus, only 1 of the 18 carotid territory strokes was potentially preventable by carotid intervention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Since 2005, four studies have reported patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis of 70 to 99 percent (n = 156) or 50 to 99 percent (n = 42) who did not have prophylactic carotid revascularization; the rate of perioperative stroke with CABG in these patients was 0 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-grafting-in-patients-with-cerebrovascular-disease/abstract/12,23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,23-26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">While not high-quality data, these studies suggest that patients with asymptomatic unilateral carotid artery stenoses are at little or no increase in risk of perioperative stroke during CABG. However, it remains controversial whether asymptomatic internal carotid artery stenosis is a major cause of stroke that would benefit from revascularization, or is merely a surrogate stroke risk marker associated with multiple other potential stroke risk factors and mechanisms, in which case carotid revascularization would be expected to have little or no benefit.</p><p/><p>Although there is little direct evidence, it is plausible that characteristics of the carotid lesion, such as plaque morphology and the presence of downstream microemboli on transcranial Doppler, may impact the risk of perioperative stroke with CABG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-grafting-in-patients-with-cerebrovascular-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Of note, the presence of additional risk factors in patients with carotid stenosis undergoing CABG surgery may predispose to stroke by a mechanism other than carotid artery stenosis, such as atrial fibrillation, aortic arch atheroma, or left ventricular dysfunction (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10677841\"><span class=\"h3\">Prevalence and predictors of carotid stenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reported prevalence of carotid artery disease in patients undergoing CABG has varied from 2 to 22 percent, with an average of approximately 8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-grafting-in-patients-with-cerebrovascular-disease/abstract/1,16,28-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16,28-32</a>].

The major considerations include the following issues:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with asymptomatic unilateral carotid artery stenoses, who account for the majority of patients with carotid disease undergoing cardiac surgery, appear to be at little or no increase in risk of perioperative stroke during CABG (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Carotid stenosis'</a> above). Any potential benefit of carotid intervention is likely to be offset by the procedural risks if carotid stenosis is not an important cause of perioperative stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-grafting-in-patients-with-cerebrovascular-disease/abstract/21,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,40</a>]. A systematic review suggested that at least one-half of perioperative strokes are not preventable by carotid intervention, as 50 percent of patients with stroke did not have significant carotid stenosis, and 60 percent of strokes identified radiographically or by autopsy could not be attributed to carotid disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-grafting-in-patients-with-cerebrovascular-disease/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. A subsequent single-center observational study found that only one of 18 carotid territory strokes was potentially preventable by carotid intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-grafting-in-patients-with-cerebrovascular-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As noted above, the benefit of carotid revascularization with carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid stenting in patients requiring CABG has not been systematically addressed. In the general population (ie, patients who do not require concomitant cardiac surgery), large randomized clinical trials have demonstrated the benefit of CEA for patients who have asymptomatic carotid stenosis of 60 to 99 percent, provided that their perioperative risk is less than 3 percent and their life expectancy is at least five years. Similarly, major clinical trials have established clear benefit of CEA compared with medical treatment for patients who have symptomatic carotid disease, provided that their perioperative risk is less than 6 percent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-asymptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of asymptomatic carotid atherosclerotic disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-symptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of symptomatic carotid atherosclerotic disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">One major caveat regarding these data is that optimal medical management of stroke risk factors has evolved since the major trials of CEA were conducted (generally the late 1980s through early 2000s), particularly with regard to use of statin therapy for management of hypercholesterolemia, more aggressive lipid and blood pressure goals, and the availability of newer antiplatelet agents. In reports published since the mid 2000s, rates of stroke in patients with significant carotid stenosis who are managed on medical therapy have declined when compared with those who were enrolled in the earlier surgical trials. Accumulating data suggest that aggressive medical therapy alone may be the most appropriate treatment for patients with asymptomatic carotid disease (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-symptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of symptomatic carotid atherosclerotic disease&quot;, section on 'Medical management'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-asymptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease#H1424714856\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of asymptomatic carotid atherosclerotic disease&quot;, section on 'Medical management'</a>). Moreover, the trials that established the benefit of CEA excluded patients who had a recent (within six months) history of myocardial infarction or unstable angina.

We suggest a combined procedure of CEA plus CABG for patients with severe left main coronary heart disease, diffuse coronary heart disease without satisfactory collaterals, or unstable angina. However, the optimal choice of carotid revascularization therapy will be established only by future prospective randomized controlled trials. </p><p>Regardless of choice and timing of revascularization, all patients with concomitant cardiac and carotid atherosclerosis should be treated with aggressive medical management unless contraindicated, including long-term antiplatelet treatment, statin therapy, aggressive blood pressure control, and tobacco cessation.

However, these data come from trials that excluded patients requiring cardiac revascularization. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-asymptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of asymptomatic carotid atherosclerotic disease&quot;, section on 'Carotid stenting'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-symptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of symptomatic carotid atherosclerotic disease&quot;, section on 'Carotid stenting'</a>.)</p><p>An important concern in patients also slated to undergo coronary revascularization is that a dual antiplatelet regimen (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>) is recommended for a circumscribed period of time following stenting in all patients to prevent stent thrombosis. As a result, the strategy of CAS immediately prior to CABG is not recommended, since the incidence of perioperative bleeding would be significantly increased. This risk is illustrated by results from the nonrandomized SHARP study of 101 patients who had same-day CAS and CABG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-grafting-in-patients-with-cerebrovascular-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. All patients received aspirin beginning at least three days before carotid stenting, and clopidogrel was started within 6 to 10 hours after the end of CABG. At 30 days, major bleeding occurred in four patients (4 percent), a rate we consider four times higher than acceptable or expected for CABG. Furthermore, this major bleeding risk could exceed the risk of stroke and thus outweigh any potential benefit from the carotid procedure.</p><p>Thus, patients who need immediate CABG and who require a carotid intervention should have an open CEA rather than a stenting procedure. For patients with significant coronary heart disease, CAS can be considered only if the CABG is not urgent. Such patients could receive a carotid stent with antiplatelet therapy for several weeks, followed by CABG surgery.</p><p>A systematic review published in 2009 identified 11 studies with 760 patients who had CAS followed by staged CABG, which was done at different time intervals in individual studies, ranging from immediately after stenting to a mean of 70 days after stenting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-grafting-in-patients-with-cerebrovascular-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Eighty-seven percent of the patients had asymptomatic carotid stenosis; all of the studies were retrospective and most were single-center. Combined event rates, from CAS to 30 days after CABG, were as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ipsilateral stroke, 3.3 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any stroke, 4.2 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myocardial infarction, 1.8 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Death, 5.5 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Death and any stroke, 9.1 percent</p><p/><p>The investigators concluded that these event rates for CAS followed by CABG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-grafting-in-patients-with-cerebrovascular-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>] were similar to those reported for patients who had staged CEA and CABG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-grafting-in-patients-with-cerebrovascular-disease/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7791877\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing of revascularization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Operating on the carotid lesion first might increase the risk of myocardial infarction, while operating on the coronary lesion first might increase the risk of perioperative stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-grafting-in-patients-with-cerebrovascular-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Furthermore, an additional period of anesthesia might increase the risk of either of the staged procedures.

Most of the cardiac procedures (92 percent) involved CABG, either alone or combined with other cardiac interventions such as valve surgery. Carotid disease was asymptomatic in 81 percent; there was a contralateral carotid stenosis (80 to 99 percent) in 9 percent, and a contralateral carotid occlusion in 13 percent. The following outcomes were reported:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There was a significantly lower risk of interstage myocardial infarction (MI) for the staged <span class=\"nowrap\">CAS/cardiac</span> surgery group compared with the staged <span class=\"nowrap\">CEA/cardiac</span> surgery group (3 versus 11 percent), although the rates were similar for stroke (1 versus 2 percent) and death (5 versus 7 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the composite endpoint of death, MI, and stroke, the staged <span class=\"nowrap\">CAS/cardiac</span> surgery group and the combined <span class=\"nowrap\">CEA/cardiac</span> surgery group had lower rates compared with the staged <span class=\"nowrap\">CEA/cardiac</span> surgery group at 30 days after cardiac surgery (10 versus 10 versus 31 percent, respectively) and at one year (16 versus 17 versus 40 percent, respectively). These results were driven largely by the higher interstage (ie, pre-cardiac surgery) MI event rate for the staged <span class=\"nowrap\">CEA/cardiac</span> surgery group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the period beyond one year after cardiac surgery, the staged <span class=\"nowrap\">CAS/cardiac</span> surgery group had a lower composite event rate compared with the combined <span class=\"nowrap\">CEA/cardiac</span> surgery group and staged <span class=\"nowrap\">CEA/cardiac</span> surgery group (12 versus 39 versus 27 percent, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">These data suggest that staged CAS followed by CABG is the optimal strategy for patients with high-grade carotid stenosis who do not require urgent coronary revascularization, while combined CEA and cardiac surgery is optimal for those who do require urgent coronary intervention. One of the relative strengths of this study is that patients in the staged <span class=\"nowrap\">CAS/cardiac</span> surgery group were evaluated by a neurologist before and after CAS, suggesting that the stroke event rate for this group is reliable; in contrast, patients in the CEA groups were examined by a neurologist on an as-needed basis, as is true of nearly all such studies. However, limitations to this study, particularly the lack of randomization and retrospective methodology, precluded definitive conclusions.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical techniques of combined CEA and CABG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the decision has been made to perform a combined carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and CABG procedure, does it make a difference whether the CEA is done before or during cardiopulmonary bypass? As noted previously (see <a href=\"#H228961047\" class=\"local\">'Observational studies'</a> above), retrospective data suggest that perioperative complication rates are probably similar with combined CEA and CABG compared with CEA before CABG. In addition, performing CEA during cardiopulmonary bypass does not appear to increase the incidence of bleeding or prolong hospital stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-grafting-in-patients-with-cerebrovascular-disease/abstract/54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-56</a>].</p><p>Our preference is to perform the CEA before cardiopulmonary bypass. After general anesthesia is induced and the patient is prepared for operation and draped, the CEA team proceeds to expose the carotid artery. Simultaneously, the cardiac team is harvesting the saphenous vein or the radial artery, if such grafts are necessary. The CEA is performed using systemic heparinization and a shunt. Once the CEA is completed, the heparin is not reversed, and the neck wound is packed but not closed. The chest is opened, the internal mammary artery is harvested, and the patient is placed on cardiopulmonary bypass, and the revascularization is completed. After the heparin is reversed, the neck excision is carefully checked for bleeding and the wound is closed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H48343353\"><span class=\"h1\">TIMING OF CABG AFTER STROKE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a prior history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) have an increased risk of perioperative stroke with CABG (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above), which may be as high as 8.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-bypass-grafting-in-patients-with-cerebrovascular-disease/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The optimal timing of CABG surgery following a stroke has not been systematically addressed and depends upon multiple factors, including the size of the stroke, the risk of stroke recurrence (which is in turn dependent on the stroke mechanism), and the urgency of cardiac intervention. Unless emergent cardiac revascularization is necessary, surgery should be delayed pending a thorough work-up for stroke mechanism, including evaluation for large artery stenosis and any cardioembolic source, to identify the risk of subsequent stroke and ensure appropriate risk factor modification. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-prevention-for-specific-causes-of-ischemic-stroke-and-transient-ischemic-attack\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary prevention for specific causes of ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Optimal timing of cardiac surgery should also include a sufficient delay to allow for post-stroke recovery of autoregulatory capabilities of the cerebral vasculature prior to exposure to periprocedural hypotension, and for sufficient remodeling of the damaged parenchyma to decrease the risk of hemorrhagic transformation of the infarct. Deferral of cardiac surgery for several weeks is suggested, although patients with large strokes (ie, those with damage involving the majority of a vascular territory or a sizeable portion of multiple territories) would likely benefit from additional delay. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main mechanisms of ischemic stroke associated with coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery are cerebral hypoperfusion and atheroembolization, particularly from the aortic arch.
