This trend has largely been attributed to the increase in women pursuing postgraduate educational degrees and higher levels of professional achievement, activities whose demands for time and energy compete with those of starting a family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Because the ability to conceive is strongly influenced by a woman's age, many women who delay childbearing may face infertility by the time they are ready to become pregnant. The prevalence of infertility increases significantly after age 35 year, and by age 45 years, as many as 99 percent of women are infertile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Although these procedures are commonly considered for women undergoing sterilizing treatments (eg, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, ovarian resection), elective use of fertility preservation techniques among women of advancing reproductive age remains controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>].</p><p>Fertility preservation options that may be applied to women of advancing reproductive age will be discussed here. Preservation of fertility in patients undergoing sterilizing therapies is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fertility-preservation-in-patients-undergoing-gonadotoxic-treatment-or-gonadal-resection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fertility preservation in patients undergoing gonadotoxic treatment or gonadal resection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">AGE-RELATED DECLINE IN FEMALE FERTILITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The influence of female age on fertility has been clearly established by a number of observational studies, which have consistently demonstrated a decline in pregnancy rates with advancing maternal age. Furthermore, cycles that result in pregnancy are less likely to progress to live births because of higher rates of miscarriage among older women. These relationships are best illustrated by outcome data from clinics performing in vitro fertilization (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F51787\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51787 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Effects of advanced maternal age on pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The progressive loss of oocytes that occurs from fetal life until menopause is one of the defining features of the age-related decline in female fertility. The oocyte pool peaks while the female fetus is in utero, reaching approximately six to seven million oocytes at 20 weeks of gestation. Subsequently, progressive atresia occurs so that the number of remaining oocytes is approximately one to two million at birth and 200,000 at the onset of puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. During the reproductive years, there is continued atresia, which occurs at an accelerated rate after the age of 37 in normal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The average age of menopause is 51, at which time there are approximately 1000 oocytes remaining.</p><p>As the number of oocytes declines over time, the quality of oocytes also declines and eventually reaches a critical threshold below which pregnancy is no longer possible. The decrease in quality primarily refers to an increased prevalence of aneuploid oocytes, largely due to dysfunctions of the meiotic spindle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Errors in meiotic segregation result in higher rates of chromosomally abnormal embryos, translating into higher rates of miscarriage and lower chances of pregnancy. It is estimated that the prevalence of aneuploid oocytes approaches 100 percent after the age of 45 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Extensive experience with assisted reproduction through oocyte donation demonstrates that reproductive aging is primarily related to the &quot;age&quot; of the oocyte, and is influenced very little, if at all, by the &quot;age&quot; of the uterus. The ability of the uterus to successfully host a pregnancy is maintained despite advancing maternal age. As a result, the probability of pregnancy when using donor oocytes is determined by the age of the oocyte donor rather than the age of the recipient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. Although pregnancy outcomes in women of advanced maternal age are associated with increased rates of complications (eg, pregnancy-induced hypertension, gestational diabetes), the majority of pregnancies in women of advancing age have good outcomes in the absence of underlying maternal medical conditions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Effects of advanced maternal age on pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">OPTIONS FOR FERTILITY PRESERVATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because the age-related decline in fertility is primarily related to the oocyte, strategies to preserve oocytes are likely to afford effective means of avoiding infertility in women who wish to delay childbearing. For women who are approaching advanced reproductive age, but are not ready to become pregnant or are not in the position to have a child, options to preserve fertility, including embryo and oocyte cryopreservation, may be considered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EMBRYO CRYOPRESERVATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Embryo cryopreservation is a proven method of fertility preservation. Since the first human pregnancy following the transfer of cryopreserved embryos was described in 1983 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], embryo cryopreservation has become a routine part of in vitro fertilization (IVF). In 2014 in the United States, frozen embryo transfer accounted for nearly half of live births from all assisted reproductive technology procedures (22,267 of 57,323 live births) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Embryo cryopreservation follows a standard IVF procedure that normally involves controlled ovarian hyperstimulation with daily injectable gonadotropins initiated in the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle or after an interval on the birth control pill, and continued for approximately 10 to 14 days to achieve multiple periovulatory follicles. Preovulatory oocytes are retrieved via needle aspiration utilizing transvaginal ultrasound guidance (a procedure which is done under conscious sedation), and are then fertilized with sperm in the laboratory. The sperm can be provided by a participating male partner or by an anonymous sperm donor. The resulting embryos are cryopreserved, and can be stored until the woman is ready to attempt to conceive. There is no known time limit for the duration of embryo storage; a live birth was achieved following transfer of embryos that had been cryopreserved nearly 20 years earlier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=in-vitro-fertilization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;In vitro fertilization&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Live birth rates from frozen-thawed embryos depend on the age of the woman at the time of the egg retrieval. In the United States in 2014, embryo implantation rates ranged from approximately 43 percent for women under 35 to 28 percent for women between 41 and 42 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Obstetrical outcomes in pregnancies resulting from cryopreserved embryos are similar to those resulting from fresh embryos with respect to birth weight, gestational age at delivery, perinatal mortality and rates of major congenital malformations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Thus, cryopreservation of embryos is not thought to have a negative impact on subsequent perinatal outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14894574\"><span class=\"h1\">CRYOPRESERVATION OF OOCYTES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Mature oocytes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Success of mature oocyte cryopreservation has improved dramatically over the past decade, and it is no longer considered experimental by the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>] or American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. For women who do not have a participating male partner and are not interested in using donor sperm, oocyte cryopreservation is generally the preferred option. A study comparing outcomes between electively cryopreserved oocytes and cryopreserved embryos reported similar live birth rates and perinatal outcomes between groups, suggesting that cryopreserving oocytes should no longer be considered less effective than cryopreserving embryos [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Women who are considering elective oocyte cryopreservation should be informed that there are neither large series, nor long-term follow-up on children born after this procedure for this indication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Potential candidates should be counseled thoroughly about the risks and benefits of the process, as well as the likelihood of achieving pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Counseling'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with embryo cryopreservation, ovarian stimulation followed by oocyte retrieval is necessary. Mature oocytes are cryopreserved shortly after retrieval. However, the complex biological properties of the human oocyte make oocyte cryopreservation more challenging than embryo cryopreservation.</p><p>Although the first pregnancy from oocyte cryopreservation was reported in 1986 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], the overall success rate (ie, oocyte survival, fertilization rates, pregnancy rates) remained low for many years, discouraging routine application of the technology. However, modifications in cryopreservation methods have led to significant improvements over the last decade. The three most important factors for successful cryopreservation of oocytes (and embryos) are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoidance of ice crystals, which can damage intracellular organelles</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limiting toxicity of electrolytes and other solutes during the transition from liquid to solid phase</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevention of sudden drops in extracellular osmotic pressure, which could lead to cell swelling and &quot;osmotic shock&quot; during rewarming.</p><p/><p>Barriers to successful implementation of this technique have included: (1) hardening of the zona pellucida, a consequence of freezing, which precluded fertilization by conventional insemination techniques, (2) oocyte membrane permeability, which is known to differ from that of embryos at different stages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], (3) sensitivity of the oocyte to low temperatures, and (4) susceptibility of the oocyte to cryoprotectant and electrolyte toxicity.</p><p>A variety of interventions has helped to overcome these problems:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h4\">Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) for zona pellucida hardening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oocyte cryopreservation is associated with hardening of the zona pellucida, which is thought to be mediated by premature release of cortical granules in the oocyte [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Cortical granule release is the oocyte's mechanism to block polyspermy after fertilization in vivo, and occurs immediately after the spermatozoa penetrates the zona pellucida [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Studies of oocyte calcium physiology suggest that certain cryoprotectants used in the cryopreservation process may induce premature cortical granule release in frozen-thawed oocytes, thereby inhibiting sperm penetration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In vitro, conventional fertilization depends on the ability of the sperm to penetrate the zona pellucida, as oocytes are incubated with a specific concentration of sperm. Introduction of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), a procedure in which a single spermatozoa is directly inserted into the cytoplasm of the oocyte, led to significant improvements in fertilization rates, allowing for increased live birth rates after oocyte cryopreservation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/16,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,31,32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h4\">Use of cryoprotectants to avoid intracellular ice crystal formation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use of cryoprotectant agents is essential to the inhibition of ice crystal formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Depending on their chemical properties, cryoprotectants can generally be divided into two categories, permeating and non-permeating.</p><p>Permeating cryoprotectants, such as propylene glycol, ethylene glycol, glycerol and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), diffuse across the cell membrane, and form hydrogen bonds with water molecules within the cell, thereby interfering with the ability of the water molecules to come together as a crystalline lattice. The ability to prevent intracellular ice crystals increases as the concentration of the cryoprotecting agent within the cell increases. Non-permeating cryoprotectants such as sucrose and trehalose remain extracellular, and dehydrate the cell by osmotic forces, drawing free water out of the cell.</p><p>Although permeating and non-permeating cryoprotectants are critical components of successful cryopreservation of human cells, high concentrations are theoretically toxic. Thus, optimal cryopreservation methods must inhibit intracellular ice formation while limiting exposure to potentially toxic concentrations of cryoprotectants.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h4\">Methods to limit toxicity of cryoprotectants and solutes</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h5\">Slow freeze</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conventional oocyte freezing protocols are derived from &quot;slow freeze&quot; techniques, which have been used to effectively cryopreserve embryos for decades. The slow freeze method involves use of low concentrations of cryoprotectants initially, since low concentrations are less toxic to oocytes at temperatures at which they are metabolically active. As the temperature decreases gradually and the oocyte's metabolic rate declines, the concentration of cryoprotectants is increased to prevent intracellular ice crystal formation. After approximately two hours, the concentration of cryoprotectants becomes high enough to support solidification of the oocyte without formation of intracellular ice (&quot;glass-like&quot;). At this point, rapid exposure to much lower temperatures is possible, so straws containing the oocytes are plunged into liquid nitrogen.</p><p>Various adjustments to solute and cryoprotectant concentrations over time have resulted in marked improvements in oocyte survival and pregnancy rates after slow freezing. The largest clinical experience with slow freezing described a series of 1769 cryopreserved oocytes from 96 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Of these, 1503 were thawed, yielding a survival rate of 54.1 percent, a fertilization rate with ICSI of 57.7 percent, and cleavage stage embryos developed in 91.2 percent. Sixteen pregnancies were achieved, resulting in seven singleton and two twin live births. Significantly higher survival rates were achieved when oocytes were cryopreserved in higher concentrations of sucrose (0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mol/L</span> versus 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mol/L</span> sucrose), and when duration of exposure to cryoprotectant was longer (10.5 versus 15 minutes).</p><p>A meta-analysis including data from 26 reports of the slow freeze process attempted to determine the efficiency of oocyte cryopreservation by slow freezing relative to in vitro fertilization with fresh oocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. For the slow freeze group, the estimated fertilization rate was 61 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">(1346/2217),</span> the clinical pregnancy rate per transfer was 27 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">(95/351),</span> and the live birth rate per transfer was 21.6 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">(76/351)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. These rates were significantly lower than those with in vitro fertilization with fresh oocytes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h5\">Vitrification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vitrification is an alternative approach to oocyte freezing. It is based upon the principle that metabolically active cells can be cooled so rapidly that ice does not have time to form. During vitrification, permeating cryoprotectants are added at high concentrations, a very short time is allowed for equilibration, and an extremely rapid rate of cooling is used. The first birth from vitrified human oocytes was reported in 1999 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Since then, a meta-analysis including five reports on vitrification estimated fertilization rates of 74 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">(637/859),</span> clinical pregnancy rates per transfer of 45.5 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">(61/134),</span> and live birth rate per transfer of 36.6 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">(49/134)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. These rates are comparable to those achieved using frozen and thawed embryos. &#160;</p><p>To achieve rapid cooling rates of up to 20,000 degrees Celsius per minute, oocytes are placed in small volumes of cryoprotectant-containing media and directly exposed to liquid nitrogen using &quot;open-carrier&quot; devices such as microscope grids, cryoloops, and open pulled straws. Concern regarding the risk of infectious disease transmission through contaminated liquid nitrogen led to the development of &quot;closed-carrier&quot; methods, which yield a significantly slower cooling rate of approximately 200 degrees Celsius per minute. A study of vitrified human pronuclear embryos demonstrated similar rates of blastocyst development between open and closed carrier systems despite the slower cooling rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, there is limited evidence supporting the efficacy of closed systems for oocyte cryopreservation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h5\">Slow freeze versus vitrification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vitrification appears to be more successful than slow-freezing, but more trials are needed to establish whether one method is clearly superior to the other. In a 2011 systematic review and meta-analysis of five trials (4282 vitrified oocytes, 3524 fresh oocytes, 361 slow-frozen oocytes), compared with slow freezing, vitrification resulted in a higher oocyte survival rate (OR 2.46, 95% CI 1.82-3.32), a higher fertilization rate (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.07-2.11), a higher rate of top-quality embryos (22.4 versus 8.0 percent, OR 3.32, 95% CI 1.37-8.02), and a higher embryo cleavage rate (day 2: 64.6 versus 47.7 percent, OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.33-3.00; day 3: 53.0 versus 33.3 percent, OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.32-3.85) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Furthermore, the vitrification group had similar rates of ongoing pregnancy, top-quality embryo, embryo cleavage, and fertilization as the fresh oocyte group. </p><p>Traditionally, an advantage of the slow freeze method was that embryologists were familiar with the approach since the techniques and equipment were essentially identical to those that were routinely used in the cryopreservation of precompaction-stage embryos. Vitrification requires use of alternative equipment and techniques, thus potentially results in more operator-dependent and less consistent results. However, these concerns have diminished as experience with vitrification of both oocytes and embryos has accumulated and as it continues to yield favorable outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Ovarian tissue</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ovarian tissue cryopreservation is an investigational method of fertility preservation. It has the potential advantage of preserving a large number of oocytes within primordial follicles without the need for ovarian stimulation. Strips of ovarian tissue can be reimplanted orthotopically (into the pelvis) or heterotopically (into alternative sites, such as the forearm), or oocytes may be isolated from the ovarian cortex and matured in vitro. However, retrieval of ovarian tissue requires an invasive surgical procedure (generally performed by laparoscopy). Additionally, optimal surgical techniques and laboratory methodology have yet to be established, and appropriate clinical indications remain unclear.</p><p>It is not known how many women have had ovarian tissue cryopreserved or reimplanted, and approximately 86 live births have resulted from this technology as of 2017 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. This procedure is generally reserved for women at risk of ovarian failure from cytotoxic drugs or radiation therapy. It is considered an investigational procedure in women considering fertility preservation for delayed childbearing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

In addition to age, assessment of markers of ovarian reserve, including anti-M&uuml;llerian hormone concentration, antral follicle count and day 3 follicle-stimulating hormone and estradiol concentration can help guide counseling.&nbsp;Oocyte cryopreservation in women &le;30 years of age increases the probability that the oocytes will never be used to achieve a pregnancy because the woman will eventually decide to remain childless or will conceive without using the cryopreserved oocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].&nbsp;Counseling about oocyte cryopreservation is likely best focused on women in the age range of 30 to 35 years and in younger women known to have a diminished oocyte pool.&nbsp;A calculator that provides information about the relationship between age, number of oocytes retrieved, and probability of achieving a live birth is available <a href=\"https://www.mdcalc.com/bwh-egg-freezing-counseling-tool-efct&amp;token=5yLNPmHjkOhvnhOBCCm6DG5YBJXYjth9van5g7dDHuYWP8YTLZQLuf+qCbuxacHZtXRLWoxk8TjTgBmMUdkfRWmDHvfsdT5roHkY84HcBNA=&amp;TOPIC_ID=7429\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">online</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].&nbsp;The calculator predicts that if 10 oocytes are cryopreserved for women 30 and 37 years of age, the probability of achieving one live birth using thawed oocytes is 69 and 50 percent, respectively.&nbsp;Societal trends are likely to support the continued development and greater use of oocyte cryopreservation as insurance against female infertility due to advancing age.</p><p>Additional factors to consider include the following:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Age at the time of the procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The older a woman is at the time of oocyte cryopreservation, the lower the probability of live birth in the future. Based on the data summarized above from women whose average age was 33 years at the time of oocyte freezing, approximately 5 percent of thawed oocytes will successfully implant and 4 percent will result in a live birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Thus, approximately 20 to 25 oocytes would need to be thawed to achieve a high statistical probability of single live birth.</p><p>Few studies have assessed the impact of age on success of oocyte cryopreservation for elective delay in childbearing. In a study of 1468 women who underwent oocyte vitrification for elective fertility preservation (mainly due to advancing age), 137 women (9 percent) returned to use their oocytes with resultant live birth rates per patient of 50 percent for women &le;35 years of age to 23 percent for women &ge;36 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Additionally, several observational studies have evaluated the impact of age in the context of infertile populations who froze supernumerary oocytes from fresh in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 342 infertile patients who underwent thaw cycles of slow-frozen oocytes reported clinical pregnancy rates of 27.7, 21.4, and 17.6 percent per transfer in age groups &le;34 years (n = 138), 35 to 38 years (n = 114), and &ge;39 years (n = 90), respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Although there appears to be a lower success rate in the older age groups, the differences were not statistically significant in this study. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study of infertile couples, 182 warming cycles of supernumerary vitrified oocytes resulted in significantly lower clinical pregnancy rates per transfer with increasing maternal age, from 48.6 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">(17/35)</span> for age &le;34 years down to 22 percent <span class=\"nowrap\">(4/18)</span> for ages 41 to 43 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. </p><p/><p>These data support the concept that women who are older at the time of oocyte cryopreservation should expect to have a lower probability of live birth in the future than those who are younger. However, clinical pregnancies can be achieved from oocyte cryopreservation in women ages 41 to 43 years, which suggests that this technology could be beneficial even in this very advanced reproductive age group. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16485204\"><span class=\"h2\">Maximum age for oocyte cryopreservation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The maximum age for attempting oocyte cryopreservation may be as high as 45 years, based on a study that evaluated the success of IVF in women &gt;44 years. In this study, IVF yielded live births up to the age of 45 years, but success was limited to those patients producing &gt;5 oocytes in response to ovarian stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Although pregnancy rates for 46 and 47 year old patients in this study were 17 and 9 percent, respectively, none of these pregnancies resulted in a live birth. Thus, it may be reasonable to consider oocyte cryopreservation for fertility preservation up to age 45 years as long as the patient is thoroughly counseled about the low probability of success.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Planned age of childbearing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The woman must consider the length of time that she wishes to delay childbearing, and weigh the probability of a naturally conceived pregnancy at that specific time in the future (eg, her age in two years, five years, etc) against the probability of a live birth from oocyte cryopreservation. The longer the interval of expected delay and, in turn, the older her age, the more beneficial oocyte cryopreservation is likely to be.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of miscarriage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Miscarriage rates vary widely among published series, ranging from 20 to 50 percent in early reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/34,48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,48-50</a>]. A meta-analysis of data from pregnancies resulting from slow freezing reported 19 miscarriages out of 95 clinical pregnancies, for an overall loss rate of 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Although the potential for publication bias in this meta-analysis is substantial, it appears that the reported rate of miscarriage after oocyte cryopreservation is comparable to that of naturally conceived pregnancies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Risks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While preliminary outcomes from oocyte cryopreservation are encouraging, the number of live births to date by either method of oocyte cryopreservation is insufficient to be certain of the safety of these techniques. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3883183452\"><span class=\"h3\">Obstetric and childhood outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While there are few large case series of pregnancy and childhood outcomes following successful oocyte cryopreservation performed for fertility preservation, there is no evidence indicating an increased risk with oocyte cryopreservation compared with other fertility treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].&nbsp;In one series of over 1000 live births following the use of thawed oocytes to achieve pregnancy, the obstetrical and newborn outcomes were similar to those observed in live births derived from the use of fresh oocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Aneuploidy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chromosomal abnormalities are of particular concern due to the fragility of the meiotic spindle. Because chromosomes segregate along the spindle apparatus during meiosis, proper functioning is essential to avoid embryonic aneuploidy. Although oocyte cooling can disrupt the spindle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>], studies have consistently shown that the spindle reforms after thawing. These studies used a computer-assisted polarization microscopy system (polyscope) to analyze the meiotic spindle of oocytes without affecting their viability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. With use of this device, spindle repolymerization has been observed to occur at similar rates in both slow-frozen and vitrified oocytes, and normal spindle configuration was seen in similar proportions of frozen-thawed oocytes and controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Most importantly, karyotyping of frozen-thawed oocytes has shown no increase in the number of abnormal or stray chromosomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>] and fluorescence in situ hybridization has shown the incidence of aneuploid embryos is no different for embryos resulting from frozen oocytes and those resulting from fresh oocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Furthermore, there have been no reports of an increased incidence of aneuploidies among live births reported from frozen and thawed oocytes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Congenital anomalies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There have been no reports of an increased incidence of congenital anomalies or other adverse outcomes among live births resulting from frozen and thawed oocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/58-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-61</a>]. Two follow-up studies of 13 and 16 children born from cryopreserved oocytes found no abnormalities in birth weight, organ formation, intellectual or developmental deficits, or karyotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. The largest review of perinatal outcomes after oocyte cryopreservation analyzed outcomes in 936 live births from cryopreserved oocytes and found the rate of congenital abnormalities (1.3 percent) was not increased compared to the rate in spontaneously conceived infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-preserving-options-for-women-of-advancing-age/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">LOGISTICS AND COST</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who are considering fertility preservation should first have a detailed consultation with a reproductive endocrinologist to address the issues discussed above. Potential candidates will generally undergo baseline ovarian reserve testing (day 3 serum FSH and estradiol levels and antral follicle count) prior to initiating treatment. The processes of embryo and oocyte cryopreservation are identical to that of in vitro fertilization up until the time of the oocyte retrieval. Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation with daily injectable gonadotropins is initiated in the early follicular phase or after an interval on the birth control pills, and continues for approximately 10 to 14 days to achieve multiple periovulatory follicles. During this time, frequent monitoring of serum estradiol levels and follicle diameters is standard practice, often requiring office visits every two to three days. The oocyte retrieval is performed via needle aspiration utilizing transvaginal ultrasound guidance, typically under conscious sedation. For embryo cryopreservation, oocytes are inseminated with sperm and can be frozen at different stages of embryo development from zygote to cleavage stage to blastocyst stage. For oocyte cryopreservation, mature oocytes are frozen on the day of the oocyte retrieval, and additional oocytes can be frozen the following day if in vitro maturation is achieved.</p><p>In the United States, the cost of embryo and oocyte cryopreservation procedures is comparable to that of in vitro fertilization. A single cycle including monitoring visits, surgical, anesthesia and embryology costs totals approximately $6000 to $8000. Medications cost an additional $1000 to $3000 depending on the amount prescribed. Annual storage fees are approximately $400 per year.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1164906028\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
