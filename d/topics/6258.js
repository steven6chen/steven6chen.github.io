Testicular GCTs are rare prior to puberty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Other testicular malignancies include sex cord-stromal tumors, including Leydig cell and Sertoli cell tumors, gonadoblastoma, and tumors of other cell types presenting in the testes such as lymphoma, carcinoid tumors, and metastatic carcinoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F81626\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81626 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anatomy and pathology of testicular tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Testicular tumors usually present as a nodule or painless swelling of one testicle, which may be noted incidentally by the patient or by his partner. Approximately 30 to 40 percent of patients complain of a dull ache or heavy sensation in the lower abdomen, perianal area, or scrotum, while acute pain is the presenting symptom in 10 percent. In another 10 percent, the presenting manifestations of testicular cancer are attributable to metastatic disease; symptoms vary with the site of metastasis. Approximately 5 percent have gynecomastia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-testicular-germ-cell-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of testicular germ cell tumors&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-evaluation-of-gynecomastia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and evaluation of gynecomastia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The presentation is different in Leydig cell tumors, which account for 2 percent of testicular tumors. Only 10 percent are malignant, and the clinical presentation is dominated by symptoms of excess estrogen and reduced testosterone&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. There is a bimodal distribution of these tumors; they are found in 6- to 10-year-old boys who present with precocious puberty, and in 26- to 35-year-old men who present with a testicular mass, gynecomastia, impotence, and loss of libido. Sertoli cell tumors are even less common and also present with symptoms of excess estrogen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 9300 men are diagnosed with testicular cancer each year in the United States, but only approximately 400 men will die of their disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Worldwide, there are approximately 72,000 cases and 9000 deaths per year due to testicular cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Epidemiologic evidence suggests that the incidence of testicular cancer has been increasing worldwide since the early 1900s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database of the National Cancer Institute, the overall incidence of testicular germ cell tumors (GCTs) among American men rose 44 percent from 3.35 per 100,000 men in the period from 1973 to 1978 to 4.84 per 100,000 men in the period from 1994 to 1998 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The incidence of seminoma rose 62 percent, while the incidence of nonseminomatous GCTs rose 24 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A review based upon data from 12 European countries found that the incidence of GCTs was increasing by 1 to 6 percent per year in the various countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. By contrast, mortality rates decreased or were stable in most regions, reflecting improvements in treatment.</p><p/><p>The factors responsible for the increased incidence of testicular cancer are unclear. A variety of hypotheses have been proposed, including in utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES), earlier exposure to viruses or other environmental agents, and testicular trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. However, these factors fail to completely account for increase in testicular cancer.</p><p>The observed increase has been restricted to white males. Testicular cancer is less common in African Americans, with the incidence in African Americans estimated to be one-fourth that of whites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The worldwide incidence is lowest in Africa and Asia, and highest in the Scandinavian countries, Germany, Switzerland, and New Zealand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a number of known risk factors for testicular neoplasia, including cryptorchidism, a personal or family history of testicular cancer, infertility or subfertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>], and HIV infection. All of these risk factors predispose to the development of carcinoma in situ (CIS) and invasive testicular cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Germ cell neoplasia in situ (GCNIS)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In adults, both seminomas and nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (GCTs) are preceded by a premalignant condition germ cell neoplasia in situ (GCNIS). This was formerly called testicular intratubular germ cell neoplasia of the unclassified type (IGCNU) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. This abnormality has been found in 0.4 to 1.1 percent of men undergoing testicular biopsy because of infertility, but appears to be less common in the general population. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testicular-germ-cell-neoplasia-in-situ-formerly-called-intratubular-germ-cell-neoplasia-of-unclassified-type\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Testicular germ cell neoplasia in situ (formerly called intratubular germ cell neoplasia of unclassified type)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>GCNIS is found in testicular tissue adjacent to GCTs (except spermatocytic seminoma) in approximately 90 percent of adult cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. It also is observed in all patient groups at risk for testicular cancer, including men with cryptorchid testicles (up to 5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>], prior or contralateral testicular GCTs (5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>], and androgen insensitivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/19,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,25</a>]. These observations suggest the possibility of a field defect, in which genetic or developmental events that produce gonadal dysfunction confer predisposition to malignancy over a wide area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Contralateral testicular cancer'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-disorders-of-androgen-action\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of disorders of androgen action&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If GCNIS is left untreated, the risk of progression to invasive malignancy is approximately 50 percent in five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Whether all cases of GCNIS eventually progress to invasive malignancy is unclear. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testicular-germ-cell-neoplasia-in-situ-formerly-called-intratubular-germ-cell-neoplasia-of-unclassified-type\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Testicular germ cell neoplasia in situ (formerly called intratubular germ cell neoplasia of unclassified type)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Cryptorchidism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Men with cryptorchidism (or testicular malposition) have an increased risk of testicular cancer. Therefore, prophylactic orchiectomy is generally recommended, especially if the testicle is located in the abdomen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Inguinal cryptorchidism is less likely to result in malignancy compared with abdominal cryptorchidism; for these men, deferral of surgery with careful surveillance is a reasonable alternative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Of note, while 10 percent of testicular tumors occur in this setting, approximately 20 percent of cases involve the normally descended testicle. This suggests that testicular malpositioning alone does not explain the increased risk of testicular cancer. A further discussion on cryptorchidism and testicular cancer risk is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=undescended-testes-cryptorchidism-in-children-management#H496858825\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Undescended testes (cryptorchidism) in children: Management&quot;, section on 'Testicular cancer'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypospadias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of testicular GCTs appears to be increased in men with a history of hypospadias. In a health registry study from Denmark that included 5441 men with testicular GCTs, the incidence of cancer was significantly increased (relative risk 2.13, 95% CI 1.26-3.61) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Contralateral testicular cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A small percentage of men with testicular cancer will have a second testicular cancer, either at presentation or with a subsequent metachronous cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. The largest study analyzed 29,515 cases of testicular cancer in men under the age of 55 reported to the United States National Cancer Institute (NCI) Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program between 1973 and 2001 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. At presentation, 175 had a synchronous contralateral cancer (0.6 percent). The 15-year cumulative risk of a contralateral (metachronous) testicular cancer was 1.9 percent, which is similar to that reported in other studies with long-term follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>The incidence of second cancers is similar to the incidence of GCNIS seen in patients with unilateral testicular cancer who undergo biopsy of the contralateral testicle at the time of orchiectomy. Men with contralateral GCNIS appear to be the group at primary risk for the development of contralateral testis cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/22,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,24</a>]. This was illustrated in a series of 500 patients with testicular GCTs in whom the contralateral testicle was biopsied at the time of orchiectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Seven of 27 men with GCNIS developed later contralateral invasive cancer compared with none of the 473 without GCNIS.

This is higher than would be expected by chance alone, suggesting a hereditary predisposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. An international consortium that identified 461 families with 985 cases found that the clinical and pathologic manifestations of testicular GCTs in these kindreds were similar to those in nonfamilial cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>The overall contribution of family history in testicular cancer has been difficult to quantitate. However, in the largest case-control study, the greatest risk factor for testicular cancer was hereditary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. The relative risk of testis cancer is increased 6- to 10-fold in the brothers or sons of a man with testicular cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/36,38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,38-40</a>].</p><p>Genetic anticipation may occur in hereditary cases, in which the age of onset of disease in the son is earlier than that in the father [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. This phenomenon occurs in a variety of disorders such as Huntington disease in which it is due to repetitive DNA sequences within the genome that appear to become longer in successive generations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Huntington disease: Genetics and pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The genetic factors responsible for familial testicular cancers have not been identified, although a number of rare defined inherited disorders have been linked to an elevated risk of testicular cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>], and candidate chromosomal regions have been suggested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>]. Among families with testicular GCTs compatible with X-linked inheritance, a locus has been suggested on chromosome Xq27; this locus may also predispose to undescended testes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>Isochromosome 12p is present in most patients with testicular GCTs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. In a series of 179 analyzed cases, abnormal karyotypes were present in 101 (59 percent), and 79 of these had the isochromosome 12p abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

In a combined analysis of seven studies with over 440,000 men with AIDS or HIV infection, there was a modest increase in the incidence of testicular cancer, with a standardized incidence ratio of 0.7 to 1.8 compared with the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The increase appears to be limited to seminoma and does not appear to affect the incidence of nonseminomatous GCTs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>].

Microlithiasis is usually found by scrotal ultrasonography, as diffuse echogenic foci within the seminiferous tubules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>The possible relationship between testicular microlithiasis and testicular malignancy was analyzed in the literature review and meta-analysis that included data from 33 reports in which men had been referred for testicular ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Overall, the incidence of testicular GCT or GCNIS was significantly increased in the 1347 men with testicular microlithiasis compared with those in whom testicular microlithiasis was absent (risk ratio 8.5, 95% CI 4.5-16.1).</p><p>However, the utility of this observation is limited, since the relatively high frequency of microlithiasis in healthy young men precludes using this finding as a screening tool for testicular cancer. Two population-based screening studies found an incidence of microlithiasis of 5.6 and 2.4 percent, respectively, which exceeds the incidence of testicular cancer in healthy young men by approximately 1000-fold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-testicular-germ-cell-tumors/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>].</p><p>Furthermore, the incidence of microlithiasis appears to be higher when more sensitive equipment is used to perform the examinations.
