The initial clues to the diagnosis of SSS are often derived from taking the history and obtaining a routine electrocardiogram (ECG), though the symptoms (eg, fatigue, lightheadedness, palpitations, presyncope, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> syncope) and ECG findings are frequently vague and nonspecific. The occasional patient may be identified during a standard ECG or ambulatory ECG monitoring performed for another indication. Different forms of SSS exist electrophysiologically from inappropriate sinus bradycardia, chronotropic incompetence, sinus pauses, SA exit block and the tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome. Treatment of SSS is directed at symptoms and typically involves the implantation of a permanent pacemaker. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=permanent-cardiac-pacing-overview-of-devices-and-indications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Permanent cardiac pacing: Overview of devices and indications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The treatment of SSS will be reviewed here.

SSS may also manifest as chronotropic incompetence with inappropriate heart rate responses to physiologic demands during activity. SSS can also be accompanied by AV nodal conduction disturbances and by atrial tachyarrhythmias as part of the tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sick-sinus-syndrome-epidemiology-etiology-and-natural-history#H440353214\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sick sinus syndrome: Epidemiology, etiology, and natural history&quot;, section on 'Definition of SSS'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2002718\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of SSS is directed at ameliorating symptoms, which may include lightheadedness, presyncope, syncope, and, less often, dyspnea on exertion or worsening angina. In addition, patients with tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome may present with palpitations and other symptoms associated with a rapid heart rate. While some individuals present with frank syncope, patients more commonly report progressive development of symptoms and often equate this with natural aging. Specific treatment for the control of symptomatic SSS usually involves the implantation of a pacemaker. There is a limited role for pharmacologic intervention in symptomatic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hemodynamically unstable sinoatrial (SA) node dysfunction. Definitive therapy of irreversible SA node dysfunction requires the implantation of a permanent pacemaker. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sick-sinus-syndrome-epidemiology-etiology-and-natural-history\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sick sinus syndrome: Epidemiology, etiology, and natural history&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H2876490510\" class=\"local\">'Long-term management'</a> below.)</p><p>It is important to recognize that there may be an &quot;extrinsic&quot; component to SSS compounding the &quot;intrinsic&quot; component inherent to the dysfunctional SA node. The most common of these extrinsic agents are pharmacologic agents. The higher prevalence of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and atrial fibrillation (AF) in the same group of patients with SSS would make it more likely that the pharmacologic regimen of such patients may include beta adrenergic blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, and antiarrhythmic agents, all of which would potentially exacerbate any underlying SA node dysfunction. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2934929665\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial management of the patient with symptomatic SSS depends on the presence and severity of any signs and symptoms (eg, lightheadedness, presyncope, syncope, dyspnea on exertion or worsening angina) related to the ventricular rate. Unstable patients require immediate pharmacologic therapy and, in most instances, should also receive temporary pacing to increase heart rate and cardiac output. Once the patient is hemodynamically stable, assessment and treatment for any potentially reversible causes should occur, followed by placement of a permanent pacemaker for patients without an identifiable reversible etiology. </p><p>The evaluation and management of patients with symptomatic SSS should include a review of the patient's medical regimen. Identifying pharmacologic agents with the potential to exacerbate SSS (extrinsic component) is critical. If possible, discontinuing or modifying the dose of the implicated agent may help stave off the need for permanent pacing. (See <a href=\"#H3905552438\" class=\"local\">'Stable patients'</a> below.)</p><p>In order to treat patients with apparent SSS appropriately, it is important to try to correlate symptoms with bradycardia or, less commonly, the associated tachycardia. Some patients have episodic symptoms suggestive of an arrhythmia (eg, lightheadedness or palpitations) but are found to have a relatively normal heart rhythm during an episode. Due to the intermittent nature of symptomatic arrhythmias, ambulatory monitoring or an event recorder is often required to establish this correlation. Bradyarrhythmias and pauses during sleep are not taken into consideration when deciding on implantation of a pacemaker.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advanced-cardiac-life-support-acls-in-adults#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) in adults&quot;, section on 'Bradycardia'</a>.)</p><p>The most important clinical determination in a patient presenting with SSS is whether or not the patient is hemodynamically stable or not due to the resulting bradycardia and the ensuing reduced cardiac output. Signs and symptoms of hemodynamic instability include hypotension, altered mental status, signs of shock, ongoing ischemic chest pain, and evidence of acute pulmonary edema. Such patients should be treated according to the ACLS protocol for patients with symptomatic bradycardia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63919\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef63919 \">algorithm 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Atropine</a> should be promptly administered if intravenous (IV) access is available, but treatment with atropine should not delay treatment with transcutaneous pacing or a chronotropic agent.

The duration of temporary cardiac pacing should be as brief as possible, with discontinuation following treatment of reversible causes or implantation of a permanent pacemaker if no reversible cause is identified.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the absence of central venous access, the most immediate way to provide temporary cardiac pacing is via transcutaneous pacing. Transcutaneous pacing is uncomfortable for the patient and may have variable efficacy depending on how well the impulses are transmitted to the myocardium; as such, transcutaneous pacing should be viewed as a temporizing measure until temporary transvenous pacing can be provided.

However, many patients can have recurrent prolonged pauses or periods of bradycardia, so patients should be continuously monitored with transcutaneous pacing pads in place in the event of clinical deterioration. </p><p>While stable patients are being monitored, evaluation and treatment should focus on a search for reversible causes of SA nodal depression, such as drugs (eg, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>), ischemia, and autonomic imbalance. Not infrequently, a symptomatic bradyarrhythmia is induced by medications.

Professional society guidelines do not generally recommend implanting a pacemaker in asymptomatic individuals with bradycardia or pauses. One exception to this would be in a minimally symptomatic individual and a waking heart rate &lt;40 beats per minute, in whom implantation of a pacemaker is an option [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Symptoms of syncope and lightheadedness are reversed in virtually all patients following pacemaker placement, but there does not appear to be a survival benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-treatment/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2764639881\"><span class=\"h4\">Permanent pacing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Selection of the type of pacemaker and appropriate programming for a specific patient depends upon the presence or absence of atrioventricular (AV) conduction abnormalities, the presence or absence of atrial arrhythmias, the desire to maintain AV synchrony, and the need for rate-responsiveness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77929\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef77929 \">algorithm 3</a>).

Single chamber atrial-based pacing (AAI) can be used in selected cases when AV conduction is considered to be normal and when the expectation of developing impaired AV conduction is minimal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While there is an advantage in minimizing the number of leads used in a pacemaker (AAI versus DDD), the fear of the future development and progression of atrioventricular conduction disease has led to the widespread adoption of dual chamber (DDD) versus single chamber (AAI) pacing. The guidelines recommend DDD for symptomatic SSS with extension of the AV interval to minimize ventricular pacing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When it is anticipated that the patient will require frequent pacing, physiologic pacing is preferred. Physiologic pacing refers to pacing modes that most closely approximate normal cardiac behavior by maintaining AV synchrony (ie, AAI or DDD systems, in contrast to VVI systems). Promoting intrinsic AV conduction and minimizing right ventricular pacing has been shown to reduce the likelihood of developing AF, heart failure, hospitalization, and pacemaker syndrome.

This allows the pacemaker's lower rate to increase commensurate with the patient's physical activity. </p><p/><p>Several randomized trials and a subsequent 2006 meta-analysis have compared physiologic (DDD) and nonphysiologic (VVI) pacing in various settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-treatment/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>]. While some trials were limited to patients with SSS, others included patients with both SSS and AV block. Among the more than 7000 patients included in the meta-analysis, some clinical benefits were seen with physiologic pacing, primarily a reduction in the development of AF and stroke, but there was no significant difference in all-cause mortality with physiologic pacing when compared with VVI pacing. Approximately one-half of patients in the meta-analysis had SSS, and a subgroup analysis demonstrated a greater benefit from physiologic pacing in patients with SSS compared with those with AV block, including a possible reduction in the combined endpoint of cardiovascular death and stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-cardiac-pacing-nomenclature-and-selection#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of cardiac pacing: Nomenclature and selection&quot;, section on 'Potential advantages'</a>.)</p><p>For patients without a baseline bundle branch block, the incidence of high-grade AV block requiring ventricular pacing has been estimated to be between 0.6 and 1.8 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-treatment/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. However, the risk of high-grade AV block is greater in patients with a complete bundle branch block or bifascicular block at presentation (7 percent per year) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-treatment/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. This observation suggests that AAI pacing may be safe in patients with SSS who do not have baseline AV conduction abnormalities or bundle branch block. The largest randomized trial evaluating AAI pacing and DDD pacing in patients with SSS is the DANPACE trial, a multicenter, randomized study of 1415 patients with SSS and apparently normal AV conduction (baseline PR 0.22 seconds or less, baseline QRS less than 0.12 seconds) who were followed for a mean 5.4 years after initial pacemaker insertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-treatment/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. There was no significant difference in the primary outcome of death from any cause in the AAI group versus the DDD group (hazard ratio [HR] 1.06, 95% CI 0.88-1.29). Among the prespecified secondary outcomes, patients with an AAI pacemaker were significantly more likely to undergo pacemaker reoperation (22 versus 12 percent in the DDD group), although less than half of the AAI patients undergoing pacemaker reoperation did so because of a need for DDD pacing (9.3 percent). The annualized rate of developing the need for DDD pacing was 1.7 percent, which is consistent with the previously published rates. </p><p>A more detailed discussion of various pacemaker modalities and functions is presented separately.

Many patients with SSS have an SA node that is unresponsive or has a blunted response to pharmacologic agents. In a trial of 107 patients with symptomatic SSS who were randomly assigned to no therapy, a rate-responsive pacemaker, or oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> (which can increase heart rate by stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system) and followed for an average of 19 months, patients assigned to pacemaker therapy had a significantly lower incidence of syncope compared with those assigned to no therapy (6 versus 23 percent respectively) and a trend towards less syncope when compared with those receiving theophylline (6 versus 17 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-treatment/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

A known history of AF prior to pacemaker implantation as well as the duration of time since pacemaker implantation are the two most important determinants of the development of AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-treatment/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Thromboembolism may occur in patients with SSS, particularly those with the tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome and associated AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-treatment/abstract/18,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,26,27</a>]. Tachycardia-bradycardia syndrome, with periods of alternating atrial tachyarrhythmias and bradycardia, occurs in over 50 percent of cases of SSS, with AF being the most common tachyarrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-treatment/abstract/15,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,28</a>]. Thromboembolism is most likely related to the associated AF. Thus, decisions surrounding anticoagulation of patients with tachycardia-bradycardia SSS with documented episodes of AF should be guided by a discussion of the potential benefits and risks of anticoagulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F94752\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94752 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F75259\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75259 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-treatment/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

Due to the thromboembolic risks associated with unrecognized AF, patients with pacemakers should be closely observed, by means of routine pacemaker interrogation, for the development of AF. Contemporary pacemakers are able to detect and record brief episodes of AF, which may be clinically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-treatment/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Nevertheless, determining the duration of atrial tachyarrhythmias that should mandate consideration of systemic anticoagulation remains a topic of controversy and investigation with no clear guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-treatment/abstract/29,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,32</a>]. Unless there are contraindications, patients with AF should be risk stratified on their need for anticoagulant therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F94752\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94752 \">table 1</a>). Most patients with SSS are older adults, and older adult patients have both increased sensitivity to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> and an increased risk of bleeding complications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F75259\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75259 \">table 2</a>). Thus, careful monitoring is required. Other newer anticoagulants are now available and may be considered in select patients who require anticoagulation.

In a select group of patients, implantation of a pacemaker can be averted by eliminating AF through catheter ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-treatment/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The clinician should be mindful that, following ablation, AF may continue for three to six months before the full effect of the ablation is realized or that the long-term result of the ablation is not the complete but rather the partial elimination of AF, leaving them vulnerable to the consequences of post-conversion <span class=\"nowrap\">pauses/bradyarrhythmias</span>.</p><p>In rare instances, patients may be symptomatic due to profound sinus bradycardia alone, without evidence of AF or other tachyarrhythmias. In a pilot study involving 62 patients (40 patients &lt;50 years of age, 22 patients &ge;50 years of age) with symptomatic sinus bradycardia, catheter ablation of the atrial ganglionated plexus, thereby modifying autonomic input to the sinus node, resulted in significantly increased resting heart rate and attenuation of symptoms in all patients, although the effect was greater in patients &lt;50 years of age (19.3 versus 10.8 beats per minute) and was attenuated at one year in patients &ge;50 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sick-sinus-syndrome-treatment/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Though thought-provoking as a means of improving symptoms without implantation of a permanent pacemaker, these data should be replicated in additional studies with longer-term follow-up to determine if the benefit is sustained or attenuated with time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1237050460\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

These abnormalities can result in profound sinus bradycardia, sinus pauses, sinus arrest, SA nodal exit block, and inappropriate responses to physiologic demands during exercise or stress. (See <a href=\"#H4194400448\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial management of the patient with symptomatic SSS depends on the presence and severity of any signs and symptoms (eg, lightheadedness, presyncope, syncope, dyspnea on exertion or worsening angina) related to the ventricular rate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F113726\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113726 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with SSS are rarely <strong>hemodynamically unstable</strong> for a prolonged period; however, those who are should be urgently treated using the Advanced Cardiac Life Support protocol with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a>, dopamine, or epinephrine as well as temporary cardiac pacing (either with transcutaneous or, if immediately available, transvenous pacing). (See <a href=\"#H3617769232\" class=\"local\">'Unstable patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with SSS who are <strong>hemodynamically stable</strong> do not require urgent therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a> or temporary cardiac pacing. However, many patients can have recurrent prolonged pauses or periods of bradycardia, so patients should be continuously monitored with transcutaneous pacing pads in place in the event of clinical deterioration. (See <a href=\"#H3905552438\" class=\"local\">'Stable patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The evaluation and management of patients with symptomatic SSS should include a review of the patient's medical regimen. Identifying pharmacologic agents with the potential to exacerbate SSS (extrinsic component) is critical. If possible, discontinuing or modifying the dose of the implicated agent may help stave off the need for permanent pacing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The long-term management of the patient with symptomatic SSS depends on the extent of symptoms and conduction abnormalities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F113726\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113726 \">algorithm 1</a>), as well as the likelihood of recurrence or progression leading to subsequent problems (eg, syncope, cardiac arrest, etc).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Persons with bradycardia and no symptoms attributable to the bradycardia do not require placement of a permanent pacemaker. Instead, these patients may be followed with intermittent examinations and deferral of pacemaker placement. (See <a href=\"#H3479088210\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with symptomatic SSS and documented symptomatic bradycardia, we recommend implantation of a permanent pacemaker rather than medical therapy or observation alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Selection of the type of pacemaker and appropriate programming for a specific patient depends upon the presence or absence of atrioventricular (AV) conduction abnormalities, the presence or absence of atrial arrhythmias, the desire to maintain AV synchrony, and the need for rate-responsiveness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77929\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef77929 \">algorithm 3</a>).
