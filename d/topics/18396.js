It has been estimated that greater than 40 percent of patients receive one or more red blood cell transfusions while in the ICU, of which approximately 90 percent are provided in the context of stable anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-blood-products-in-the-critically-ill/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. </p><p>The appropriate use of blood products requires that the potential benefits and risks be carefully weighed for each patient. Indications and complications of blood product transfusion in the ICU are reviewed here, as well as the various types of blood products. Other issues related to transfusion of blood products are discussed separately.

This practice was based upon unproven physiological and clinical assumptions. However, a hemoglobin concentration of &lt;7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> became the accepted threshold after the multicenter Transfusion Requirements in Critical Care (TRICC) trial. The trial randomly assigned a broad population of 838 critically ill adults to either a restrictive transfusion strategy (transfusion threshold of &lt;7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> or a liberal transfusion strategy (threshold of &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> and found that the restrictive strategy decreased hospital mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-blood-products-in-the-critically-ill/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Among patients who were &lt;55 years old or less acutely ill (APACHE II score &le;20), a restrictive strategy also reduced 30-day mortality. These findings have been confirmed in subsequent meta-analysis of trials examining transfusion triggers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-blood-products-in-the-critically-ill/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Lower hemoglobin thresholds are also supported for specific subgroups of critically ill patients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sepsis &ndash; The Transfusion Requirements in Septic Shock (TRISS) trial aimed to address divergent views on transfusion in septic shock by determining the impact on mortality of a low versus high transfusion threshold during septic shock treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-blood-products-in-the-critically-ill/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Investigators randomized 998 patients with septic shock to a low transfusion threshold (&lt;7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> versus a high transfusion threshold (&lt;9 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> and identified no significant differences in 90 day mortality (43 versus 45 percent), despite patients in the low transfusion threshold group received 50 percent less red blood cell transfusions. This trial is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-sepsis-and-septic-shock-in-adults#H538543274\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of suspected sepsis and septic shock in adults&quot;, section on 'Red blood cell transfusions'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrointestinal bleeding &ndash; In patients with acute severe upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, a lower transfusion threshold is also supported by the evidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-blood-products-in-the-critically-ill/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In one trial, 921 patients with acute upper GI bleeding were randomly assigned to receive transfusion when hemoglobin fell below 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> versus 9 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>. Patients in the lower trigger group (7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> had a higher probability of survival at six weeks, less ongoing bleeding, and fewer complications relative to the liberal transfusion group. Importantly, patients with massive exsanguinating bleeding were excluded from the trial. </p><p/><p>Use of a lower hemoglobin concentration as the threshold for transfusion is also supported by several observational studies that found that red blood cell transfusions were associated with adverse outcomes (eg, increased risk of infection, acute respiratory distress, multiple organ dysfunction, and death) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-blood-products-in-the-critically-ill/abstract/2,13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13-16</a>]. A pooled analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing higher versus lower red blood cell transfusion thresholds found decreased hospital mortality in the lower transfusion threshold groups. However, 60 day all-cause mortality and intensive care unit mortality were not different between the two groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-blood-products-in-the-critically-ill/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>An important exception to the transfusion threshold of &lt;7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> is a patient who is having acute myocardial ischemia (ie, acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-blood-products-in-the-critically-ill/abstract/5,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,17</a>]. The optimal transfusion threshold for such patients is unknown because most clinical trials excluded such patients. However, in the TRICC trial, patients with active ischemic cardiovascular disease had a trend toward improved clinical outcomes when a hemoglobin level of &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> was used as the threshold for transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-blood-products-in-the-critically-ill/abstract/14,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,18</a>]. Although the improvements were not statistically significant, the effect would be clinically important if real, indicating that larger trials are needed to definitively confirm or exclude such an effect. In a secondary data analysis of Veterans Affairs intensive care unit (ICU) episodes over a five year period, improved outcome was associated with a transfusion threshold below 8.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> in patients with comorbid heart disease and near 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> in patients with an acute myocardial infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-blood-products-in-the-critically-ill/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Additional indications for red blood cell transfusion that generally exist outside of the ICU are described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications and hemoglobin thresholds for red blood cell transfusion in the adult&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">RBC preparations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Red blood cell transfusion may be performed using packed red blood cells, whole blood, or salvaged autologous blood (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-adults-storage-specialized-modifications-and-infusion-parameters\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusion in adults: Storage, specialized modifications, and infusion parameters&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Packed red blood cells &ndash; Packed red cells are the preparation used in most clinical situations. Each unit of packed red blood cells has a total volume of 300 mL, of which approximately 200 mL are red blood cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whole blood &ndash; Whole blood is rarely indicated and seldom is available. Its use should be considered only in the context of massive blood transfusion. The rationale is that massive transfusion of only one blood component (eg, red blood cells) will lead to dilutional deficiencies of the other components (eg, platelets, coagulation factors). This can be avoided by transfusing whole blood. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=massive-blood-transfusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Massive blood transfusion&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autotransfusion &ndash; Autotransfusion refers to collection of a patient's blood during acute blood loss, followed by transfusion of the blood back into the patient. It is the preferred technique whenever the collection device is rapidly available or a large volume of blood loss can be anticipated (eg, certain surgeries) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-blood-products-in-the-critically-ill/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Autotransfusion facilitates rapid transfusion of immense quantities of blood, which is generally collected from chest tubes or aspirated from the pleural and peritoneal cavities. It may be particularly valuable for patients who have multiple alloantibodies that preclude the transfusion of donor blood. Autotransfusions are acceptable to some Jehovah's Witnesses, as long as the blood does not leave the bedside for processing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-blood-products-in-the-critically-ill/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Autotransfusion systems damage the red blood cells to some degree; therefore, it is recommended that the volume of an autotransfusion be limited to less than 10 to 15 liters if possible. A systematic review of the evidence confirmed that autotransfusion reduces the need for donor blood transfusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-blood-products-in-the-critically-ill/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-blood-conservation-blood-salvage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical blood conservation: Blood salvage&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-approach-to-the-patient-who-refuses-blood-transfusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The approach to the patient who refuses blood transfusion&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Red blood cell preparations that have undergone leukoreduction (ie, removal of leukocytes) are more costly; however, they are preferred for chronically transfused patients, potential transplant recipients, patients with previous transfusion reactions, patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass, and cytomegalovirus (CMV) seronegative patients who are at risk for CMV infection and for whom seronegative components are not available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leukoreduction-to-prevent-complications-of-blood-transfusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Leukoreduction to prevent complications of blood transfusion&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">RBC alternatives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Erythropoietin is an endogenously produced hormone that stimulates erythropoiesis, provided that stores of vitamin B12, folate, and iron are adequate. Endogenous production of erythropoietin normally increases with anemia and hypoxia, but this response is blunted during critical illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-blood-products-in-the-critically-ill/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The use of recombinant erythropoietin in critically ill patients has been studied in three randomized trials with conflicting results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-blood-products-in-the-critically-ill/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. Interpretation of the studies is confounded by variable dosing regimens and variable thresholds for red cell transfusion. However, the preponderance of the evidence does not support the routine use of erythropoietin in critically ill patients. The impact of recombinant erythropoietin on avoiding transfusions appears to be small and there is insufficient evidence to determine if its benefits outweigh its risks. There may be a dose response effect, but this is inadequately studied. Two trials have demonstrated a survival advantage within the trauma subgroup of critically ill patients, despite no significant decrease in red cell transfusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-blood-products-in-the-critically-ill/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The explanation for this finding has not been established.

Generally speaking, transfusion of plasma is indicated whenever hemostasis is inadequate and the benefit of correcting the insufficient hemostasis (ie, reduced bleeding) is believed to outweigh the risks of the plasma transfusion. However, the benefit of plasma administration remains controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-blood-products-in-the-critically-ill/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.) </p><p>Examples of clinical situations in which plasma transfusions are often administered include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Active bleeding in the setting of known or strongly suspected coagulation abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-blood-products-in-the-critically-ill/abstract/28-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Massive transfusion of packed red blood cells. The rationale is that massive transfusion of red blood cells alone will lead to a dilutional deficiency of coagulation factors, which can be corrected via the transfusion of plasma. This practice is supported by several studies of massively transfused trauma patients, in which protocols with predefined ratios of plasma to red cell transfusions reduced total blood product use, reduced organ dysfunction, and improved survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-blood-products-in-the-critically-ill/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=massive-blood-transfusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Massive blood transfusion&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to invasive and surgical procedures for which there is a HIGH risk of bleeding complications (eg, thoracic, abdominal, spinal, intracranial, and some urologic surgeries), if the patient has ANY potentially significant abnormality of their coagulation tests (ie, prothrombin time, international normalized ratio [INR], or partial thromboplastin time). When deciding whether the abnormality is potentially significant, the relationship between the severity of an abnormal coagulation test and the response to plasma should be considered. (See <a href=\"#H1684591\" class=\"local\">'Plasma response'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to invasive procedures for which there is a LOW risk of bleeding complications (eg, endoscopy, cardiac catheterization, central venous catheter insertion), if the patient has a SEVERE abnormality of their coagulation tests (ie, prothrombin time &gt;2-times control, INR &gt;2, or partial thromboplastin time &gt;2-times control). Transfusion of plasma is not indicated prior to such procedures if the coagulation tests are only mildly abnormal. </p><p/><p>Generally speaking, there is a paucity of evidence regarding the transfusion of plasma prior to invasive and surgical procedures; therefore, the related indications provided here are primarily based upon clinical experience and biological rationale [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-blood-products-in-the-critically-ill/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Plasma should not be transfused to reverse excessive (ie, &quot;supra-therapeutic&quot;) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> effects, unless there is active bleeding or an urgent invasive or surgical procedure is required. Four factor prothrombin complex concentrates (4F-PCC) are recommended over fresh frozen plasma (FFP) in the setting of life-threatening hemorrhage and therapeutic warfarin therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-blood-products-in-the-critically-ill/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. The reason is that plasma products are only partially effective, have short duration of action, and may cause hypervolemia (up to a liter of fresh frozen plasma may be required to reverse the effects of excess warfarin) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-blood-products-in-the-critically-ill/abstract/31,32,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32,38</a>]. In addition, plasma products are not indicated for the treatment of hypovolemia, malnutrition, or poor wound healing, and are of limited utility in the presence of a clotting factor inhibitor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-warfarin-associated-bleeding-or-supratherapeutic-inr\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of warfarin-associated bleeding or supratherapeutic INR&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Additional indications for plasma transfusion that are generally seen outside of the ICU are described separately.

It is then frozen for storage and thawed when needed for transfusion. Once it has thawed, the plasma must be transfused within 24 hours or the concentrations of factor V and factor VIII begin to decline. FFP is the most commonly used plasma product, in part because it can ameliorate deficiencies of any of the circulating coagulation factors. FFP needs to be ABO-compatible, but does not require crossmatching or Rh typing. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thawed plasma &ndash; FFP becomes &quot;thawed plasma&quot; if it is not transfused within 24 hours of being thawed. Thawed plasma can be transfused up to five days after being thawed, if stored at refrigerator temperature (1 to 6&ordm;C). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-plasma-components#H9715100\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of plasma components&quot;, section on 'Thawed Plasma'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cryoprecipitate &ndash; Cryoprecipitate is collected by thawing FFP at 4&ordm;C and collecting the white precipitate. It is rich in von Willebrand factor, factor VIII, factor XIII, and fibrinogen. The chief advantage to cryoprecipitate is that it allows von Willebrand factor, factor VIII, factor XIII, and fibrinogen to be replaced using a much smaller volume than if those factors were replaced by transfusing FFP. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-cryoprecipitate\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of Cryoprecipitate&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factor concentrates &ndash; A factor concentrate contains a large amount of a specific clotting factor that has been produced with recombinant technology or collected from thousands of donors and pooled into a highly concentrated product. PCCs comprise a group of products containing vitamin K dependent factors. In the past, the major indication for these products is to replace specific factor deficiencies (eg, hemophilia A and B) with minimal volume and without supplying extraneous proteins. Recombinant proteins also have the advantage of being free from viral contamination. However, there has since been a paradigm shift in the administration of 4F-PCC that has been approved for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> reversal by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 4F-PCCs rather than FFP are suggested the setting of life-threatening hemorrhage and therapeutic warfarin therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-blood-products-in-the-critically-ill/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].

Its use is extremely rare because it has low levels of factor V. However, it has some utility if FFP is unavailable and the coagulopathy is likely due to deficiencies of factors other than factor V.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravenous immunoglobulin &ndash; Intravenous immunoglobulin is the purified immunoglobulin fraction of plasma pooled from several thousand donors. It is useful in the treatment of some autoimmune and immunodeficiency states. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-intravenous-immune-globulin-ivig-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Desmopressin</a> (dDAVP) may also be useful in achieving hemostasis during the short-term management of patients with certain types of von Willebrand disease, mild hemophilia A, or uremic platelet dysfunction, since dDAVP induces the release of multimers of factor VIII and von Willebrand factor from endothelial cells. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1684591\"><span class=\"h2\">Plasma response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The response to a plasma transfusion is directly proportional to the difference between the patient's levels of coagulation factors and that of the infused plasma. Thus, patients with severe factor deficiencies (manifested as severely abnormal coagulation tests) are more likely to see a significant decrease in their INR than patients with mild factor deficiencies. In fact, patients with a mildly prolonged INR may see little or no improvement, since the INR of a unit of plasma tends to be around 1.3. This was illustrated by a study in which 121 patients with an INR between 1.1 and 1.85 received transfusions of FFP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-blood-products-in-the-critically-ill/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Only one patient's INR corrected to normal and only 15 percent of patients corrected half way to normal. The median decrease in the INR was only 0.07.

ABO matching of platelets and recipients is not essential, but it is preferred because ABO-incompatible platelets may have shortened survival and incompatible donor plasma may produce a positive antiglobulin test and a small degree of hemolysis (acute hemolytic reactions cannot occur).

Fatal acute hemolytic reactions are estimated to complicate 0.003 percent of red cell transfusions and are almost always the result of ABO incompatibility; clerical errors or improperly performed typing and crossmatching are usually to blame. Acute hemolytic reactions present with pain at the infusion site, fever, chills, back and substernal pain, mental status changes, dyspnea, hypotension, elevated jugular venous pressure, cyanosis, or a bleeding diathesis due to disseminated intravascular coagulation. In the anesthetized <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> critically ill patient, these reactions may be difficult to detect and should be suspected when unexplained hypotension, hemoglobinuria, or a bleeding diathesis occurs during or shortly after transfusion. When an acute hemolytic reaction is suspected, the transfusion should be stopped immediately and blood samples collected for free hemoglobin, haptoglobin, and Coombs' testing. Crystalloid infusion to maintain the urine output above 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/h</span> should be given, and other measures to protect against possible pigment nephropathy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a>, alkalinization of urine) should be considered.

They are often mild and may be undetected. Patients who are pregnant or have received prior transfusions are at the greatest risk. Hemolysis of donor erythrocytes is gradual and less severe than with acute hemolytic reactions, but may produce jaundice, hemoglobinuria, and a falling hemoglobin concentration. Up to 35 percent of patients are asymptomatic. Delayed hemolytic reactions generally require no specific therapy, but the compatibility of future transfusions is altered because the reaction indicates that new alloantibodies are present.

They are the consequence of antileukocyte antibodies (induced by previous blood exposure) acting on donor leukocytes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the accumulation of cytokines in stored blood components. These reactions are self-limited and patients are not at increased risk for repeat febrile nonhemolytic reactions with future transfusions. Diagnosis requires that hemolysis be excluded, since both hemolytic and nonhemolytic transfusion reactions manifest fever. Transfusions complicated by febrile nonhemolytic reactions may be completed with antipyretics administered as needed. Future reactions may be avoided by using leukoreduced blood components.

Such reactions do not require previous blood exposure. The severity can range from mild urticaria to anaphylaxis. Severe reactions require that the transfusion be stopped immediately. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Epinephrine</a> may be required for hemodynamic support and to relieve bronchospasm.

Such patients may form IgE antibodies to IgA after being initially exposed to a blood product and then proceed to develop anaphylaxis upon rechallenge with an IgA-containing blood product. This possibility should be considered if dyspnea, bronchospasm, and hypotension occur in the absence of fever after only a few milliliters of a blood product have been infused. For future transfusions, such patients can be transfused with blood products that have been extra washed to remove any residual IgA.

This is particularly common among recipients who have diminished cardiac or renal function. Fresh frozen plasma is particularly prone to causing pulmonary edema because it is hyperoncotic, thereby promoting the movement of fluid from the interstitial to the intravascular space.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypothermia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood products that are stored at cold temperatures can produce profound hypothermia if they are rapidly infused due to severe bleeding. Decreasing the core body temperature to below 32 to 35&ordm;C (90 to 95&ordm;F) can produce cardiac irritability and coagulation abnormalities. It can also cause peripheral vasoconstriction, which limits tissue perfusion. Hypothermia should be prevented by using an external blood warmer to infuse blood and other intravenous fluids. However, if it occurs, it may be corrected by rewarming measures while maintaining an ambient temperature of 27&ordm;C (80&ordm;F) or greater.

During resuscitation, when blood loss is matched by fluid and blood replacement, the development of a coagulopathy is not predicted by estimations of blood loss or the number of transfusions administered. During hemorrhagic shock, to limit the contributions of hemodilution and acidosis from tissue hypoxia, data supports an approach that limits crystalloid resuscitation and provides replacement of blood products approximating a 1:1:1 ratio of PRBCs, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and platelets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-blood-products-in-the-critically-ill/abstract/34,44-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,44-53</a>].

This can produce two complications: metabolic alkalosis (since metabolism of the citrate generates bicarbonate) and a reduction in the plasma concentration of ionized calcium (due to the calcium forming complexes with citrate). Ionized hypocalcemia can lead to tetany, myocardial dysfunction, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypotension. </p><p>To prevent this problem, calcium can be administered prophylactically during massive blood transfusions using the following regimens. Ten to 20 mL of 10 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium gluconate</a> may be given intravenously per 500 mL of blood product infused. Alternatively, 2 to 5 mL of 10 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium chloride</a> may be given intravenously per 500 mL of blood product infused. Ideally, the ionized calcium concentration should be monitored in order to avoid administering too much calcium and inducing hypercalcemia. The calcium and blood products should be administered into different veins to prevent clotting of the infused blood product.

Clinical findings range from mild increases in oxygen requirements to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The full extent of pulmonary dysfunction may not manifest for hours to days after the transfusion was administered.

It is the result of persons who lack the platelet antigen HPA-1a (PlA1) becoming sensitized to the antigen when they are transfused with platelets expressing the protein. They may subsequently destroy transfused platelets via an induced alloantibody, as well as their own platelets through an undefined mechanism. Patients with this complication should receive only washed or HPA-1a negative blood products and may benefit from treatment with high dose intravenous immunoglobulin.

High risk populations, such as those patients with acute myocardial infarction may have higher thresholds. The transfusion may be performed using packed red blood cells, whole blood, or salvaged autologous blood.
