It is characterized by pain or tenderness at the radial side of the wrist. Although de Quervain tendinopathy is often attributed to overuse or repetitive movements of the wrist or thumb, the cause is generally unknown.</p><p>The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of de Quervain tendinopathy are discussed here. An overview of the anatomy and basic biomechanics of the wrist is presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anatomy-and-basic-biomechanics-of-the-wrist\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anatomy and basic biomechanics of the wrist&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H108406939\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>de Quervain tendinopathy is a common cause of wrist pain in adults. It is most common among women between the ages of 30 and 50 years of age, including a small subset of women in the postpartum period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/de-quervain-tendinopathy/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. These women tend to develop symptoms about four to six weeks after delivery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30139679\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOPATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology of de Quervain tendinopathy is not well-understood. In the past, it was frequently attributed to occupational or repetitive activities involving postures that maintain the thumb in extension and abduction. As an example, it has been thought that new mothers are at risk postpartum due to repetitive motion of hands required to lift and hold newborns. Hormonal causes and fluid retention are another plausible explanation. The evidence to support etiologic hypotheses is limited and is largely based on observational data. The histopathology does not demonstrate inflammation but rather myxoid degeneration (disorganized collagen and increased cellular matrix) in patients referred for surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/de-quervain-tendinopathy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>de Quervain tendinopathy affects both the abductor pollicis longus (APL) and the extensor pollicis brevis (EPB) at the point where they pass through a fibro-osseous tunnel (the first dorsal compartment) from the forearm into the hand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/de-quervain-tendinopathy/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. These tendons are responsible for bringing the thumb away from the hand as it lies flat in the plane of the palm (ie, radial abduction). Similar to trigger finger (or stenosing flexor tenosynovitis), this disease involves a noninflammatory thickening of both the tendons and the tunnel (or sheath) through which they pass.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with de Quervain tendinopathy describe pain at the radial side of the wrist that is more notable with thumb and wrist movement. Some patients may also notice some swelling and tenderness on the radial side of the wrist. Pain when holding or gripping objects with the affected side is also common. The dominant hand is no more likely to be involved than the nondominant hand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/de-quervain-tendinopathy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and the disease can be bilateral. The pain may radiate to the thumb or forearm. Radiographs are normal in patients with this disorder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of de Quervain tendinopathy is based upon the characteristic history of atraumatic radial wrist pain and the following physical examination findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tenderness and enlargement at the first dorsal compartment over the radial styloid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67845\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67845 \">picture 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain at the radial styloid with active or passive stretch the thumb tendons over the radial styloid in thumb flexion (the Finkelstein maneuver or test) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F58422\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58422 \">picture 2</a>)</p><p/><p>de Quervain tendinopathy is diagnosed based on symptoms and examination and is not improved by imaging. Radiographs are expected to be normal, and ultrasonographic findings include a thickened extensor retinaculum, hypervascularity on Doppler ultrasonography, thickening of the abductor pollicis longus (APL) and the extensor pollicis brevis (EPB) tendons, and partial thinning of the EPB tendon from stenosis by the thickened extensor retinaculum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/de-quervain-tendinopathy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of de Quervain tendinopathy includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osteoarthritis of the trapeziometacarpal (TMC) joint</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intersection syndrome</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ganglia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radial sensory nerve entrapment in the forearm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Calcific arthritis or tenosynovitis</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Osteoarthritis of the trapeziometacarpal joint</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Osteoarthritis of the TMC joint (the first carpometacarpal [CMC] joint) due to the normal human aging process is eventually observed in everyone. The pain and tenderness of TMC arthritis occurs at the base of the thumb, distal to the radial styloid. The grind test of the thumb, which is performed by axial compression and circumduction of the TMC joint, may elicit crepitation and pain. The Finkelstein test is sometimes, but not always, painful in both TMC arthrosis and de Quervain tendinopathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F58422\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58422 \">picture 2</a>). When in doubt, selective local anesthetic injection can be used to differentiate the disorders.

This syndrome is associated with the area where the abductor pollicis longus (APL) and extensor pollicis brevis (EPB) cross over the extensor carpi radialis longus and brevis in the distal forearm. In addition to swelling and tenderness in this area, there is often crepitation with wrist motion. A more detailed discussion of intersection syndrome is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-subacute-or-chronic-wrist-pain#H5769653\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with subacute or chronic wrist pain&quot;, section on 'Intersection syndrome'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Ganglia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The central and dorsal part of the wrist is a common site for ganglia, which are cystic swellings arising from a joint capsule or tendon sheath (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F65578\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65578 \">picture 4</a>). Ganglia can be associated with wrist pain during weightbearing in extension, but are often painless. A more detailed discussion of ganglia is presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganglion-cysts-of-the-wrist-and-hand#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ganglion cysts of the wrist and hand&quot;, section on 'Description'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Radial sensory nerve entrapment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although uncommon, the superficial radial nerve in the forearm may be entrapped between the tendons of the brachioradialis and the extensor radialis or at the wrist, where the most frequent offending agent is handcuffs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/de-quervain-tendinopathy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Unlike de Quervain tendinopathy, superficial radial sensory nerve entrapment causes burning pain and paresthesias over the dorsum of the hand, wrist, thumb, index, and middle fingers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/de-quervain-tendinopathy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2986260\"><span class=\"h2\">Crystal-induced arthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Calcium hydroxyapatite and other crystal-induced arthropathies such as gout and pseudogout can cause acute wrist pain and swelling, including the radial side of the wrist. Significant tenderness, erythema, and swelling are more commonly observed with crystal-induced arthropathies than with de Quervain tendinopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gout&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>de Quervain tendinopathy is a nonprogressive, albeit painful condition that is typically self-limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/de-quervain-tendinopathy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Therefore, the goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms and limit disability. There are limited data on the natural history of de Quervain tendinopathy, but it seems generally to resolve in approximately one year and recurrence is unusual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/de-quervain-tendinopathy/abstract/8,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H422793418\"><span class=\"h2\">Overall approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment options for de Quervain tendinopathy include nonoperative measures, glucocorticoid injection, or surgery. Our approach to therapy is usually to start with nonoperative measures, which include a forearm-based thumb spica splint with the interphalangeal joint free, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and application of ice to the affected area. A local glucocorticoid injection can be tried in patients whose symptoms have not improved with nonoperative measures.</p><p>Patients who present with severe symptoms may benefit from a glucocorticoid at the initial presentation. Most de Quervain tendinopathy resolves without surgery, but, in some, surgery may provide long-lasting relief.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H478495827\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonoperative management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest initial therapy with a forearm-based thumb spica splint with the interphalangeal joint free. The splint may be worn according to patient preferences. Full-time wear of the splint is not necessary since there is evidence that immobilization does not alter the disease course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/de-quervain-tendinopathy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. We also offer NSAIDs for pain relief, unless contraindicated by gastrointestinal, renal, or heart disease. NSAIDs can be taken for two to four weeks to see improvement in symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults#H3693478\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults&quot;, section on 'NSAIDs'</a>.)</p><p>The evidence to support the efficacy of splinting in altering the natural history of de Quervain tendinopathy is limited to observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/de-quervain-tendinopathy/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. As an example, a retrospective study comparing the use of splinting and NSAIDs, splinting plus glucocorticoid injection, or glucocorticoid injection alone in patients with de Quervain tendinopathy found that 88 percent of patients with minimal symptoms improved with splinting alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/de-quervain-tendinopathy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, the success rate of splinting and NSAIDs dropped to 32 percent among patients with moderate to severe symptoms.</p><p>Practice regarding the use of occupational therapy is highly variable, and there are few published data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/de-quervain-tendinopathy/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Occupational therapy may provide patients with useful information regarding activity modification for symptom reduction. In addition, hand and wrist exercises may improve strength and range of motion after prolonged immobility.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H478495974\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoid injection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients may be offered a local glucocorticoid injection if symptoms persist after a trial of splinting and NSAIDs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F65518\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65518 \">picture 5</a>). Depending on the severity of symptoms, some clinicians may wait approximately two to six weeks before injecting with glucocorticoids. However, for patients with severe symptoms, a glucocorticoid injection may be appropriate at the initial presentation. We use a glucocorticoid such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> mixed with a local anesthetic such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>.</p><p>A small randomized trial found that glucocorticoid injections resulted in significantly better symptom improvement compared with placebo one week after injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/de-quervain-tendinopathy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Among those who responded to glucocorticoid injections, the beneficial effects were maintained during the 12-month follow-up period. Another randomized trial also found that splinting plus glucocorticoid injection was better than splinting alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/de-quervain-tendinopathy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. One of the limitations of this trial was that a double-blind placebo injection was not used as the control. Most patients experience pain relief after a single glucocorticoid injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/de-quervain-tendinopathy/abstract/13,18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,18-21</a>]. In patients with recurrent symptoms after initial relief with the first glucocorticoid injection, a second injection may provide benefit. Limited evidence suggests that injections performed with ultrasound guidance might be more effective than without such guidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/de-quervain-tendinopathy/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>], but further study is warranted.</p><p>The risks of glucocorticoid injections include fat atrophy (thinning of the skin) and hypopigmentation (a light patch of skin at the injection site), which are rare. Hypopigmentation tends to improve over extended periods of time. It is unclear, based on the limited data, whether there is an increased risk of these complications on repeat injection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H478495980\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery is generally reserved for patients with persistent symptoms despite nonoperative therapy and glucocorticoid injection. Most patients who understand that de Quervain tendinopathy is benign and self-limiting are unlikely to choose surgery as their initial treatment strategy. Surgery seems to modify the disease course, but it has not been evaluated in randomized controlled trials. Surgery involves opening (cutting, releasing) of the first extensor (dorsal) compartment, and can be done as a simple outpatient surgical procedure using local or regional anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/de-quervain-tendinopathy/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p>Symptoms from de Quervain tendinopathy generally improve notably after surgery, but persist to some degree for at least one to two months in the postoperative period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/de-quervain-tendinopathy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The incision may be erythematous, raised, and tender to pressure for 6 to 12 months. Potential complications of surgery include injury of the superficial radial sensory nerve, continued symptoms from an incomplete release, and an unsightly scar. Other risks of any surgery include bleeding, infection, and inability to use the operated wrist for few weeks in postoperative period.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
