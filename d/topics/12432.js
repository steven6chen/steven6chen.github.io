Detailed discussions concerning the use of these drugs in specific rheumatic disorders are presented in the appropriate topic reviews covering the treatment of each condition.</p><p>The biologic DMARDs, also termed targeted biologic agents, and the small molecule, orally administered kinase inhibitors are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-biologic-agents-and-kinase-inhibitors-in-the-rheumatic-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of biologic agents and kinase inhibitors in the rheumatic diseases&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytokine-networks-in-rheumatic-diseases-implications-for-therapy#H5878192\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cytokine networks in rheumatic diseases: Implications for therapy&quot;, section on 'JAK inhibition'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS OF ACTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The immunosuppressive drugs act by a variety of mechanisms. In general, the precise mechanisms responsible for most therapeutic benefits observed with these agents are understood only partially. Unlike biologic agents that selectively inhibit a proinflammatory cytokine <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> block its receptor, conventional immunosuppressive drugs interfere with combinations of critical pathways in the inflammatory cascade (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F78362\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78362 \">table 1</a>). Among the immunosuppressive drugs, several are &quot;cytotoxic,&quot; causing either cell death or impaired proliferation; such drugs include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorambucil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorambucil</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>.</p><p>Other drugs suppress the immune system by inhibiting the proliferation or function of lymphocytes. This class includes drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>, which specifically target calcineurin and thereby inhibit the production of interleukin (IL)-2 by activated T-lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-immunosuppressive-and-conventional-non-biologic-disease-modifying-drugs-in-the-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Others prevent lymphocyte proliferation by inhibiting nucleotide synthesis. For example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil blocks the synthesis of purines, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leflunomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leflunomide</a> (LEF) inhibits pyrimidine synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-immunosuppressive-and-conventional-non-biologic-disease-modifying-drugs-in-the-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>Glucocorticoids have many effects upon innate and acquired immunity. An overview of the effects upon the immune system is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucocorticoid-effects-on-the-immune-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glucocorticoid effects on the immune system&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RELATIVE TOXICITIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No medication is without potential side effects. When selecting a drug, one must weigh its potential benefits against its possible untoward effects. The characteristics of the specific disease for which the patient is being treated also strongly influence the choice of immunosuppression. Such characteristics, which may vary from patient to patient within the same disease category, include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The extent of organ involvement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The severity of disease within a particular organ</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The rate of disease progression</p><p/><p>In acute, rapidly progressive, clinical situations that threaten either the patient's life or the function of critical organs (eg, fulminant systemic vasculitis or systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]), concerns about long-term toxicity are secondary to the need to halt inflammation as quickly as possible. In such settings, high doses of glucocorticoids combined with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> may be indicated. By comparison, safer approaches, such as low doses of glucocorticoids or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a> (HCQ), are more appropriate for vasculitis limited to the skin and for milder forms of SLE.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING FOR TOXICITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The potential risks of adverse reactions can be minimized by regular clinical and laboratory assessment. Recommended monitoring depends upon the agent being used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F58710\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58710 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-immunosuppressive-and-conventional-non-biologic-disease-modifying-drugs-in-the-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The risk to benefit ratio of any immunosuppressive drug varies with the experience of the clinician doing the monitoring, with the compliance of the patient, and with the presence of comorbid conditions that may predispose to adverse effects or poor outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">USE OF IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE DRUGS IN RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has improved, there is no known cure. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may alleviate the symptoms of RA but are inadequate as monotherapies because they fail to prevent irreversible joint damage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoids are effective in suppressing the symptoms of RA and may have an impact on disease progression. However, because of their associated toxicities, they are not ideal for the long-term management of RA. The use of glucocorticoids in the treatment of RA and the adverse effects of these medications are presented in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-glucocorticoids-in-the-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of glucocorticoids in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because active RA may lead to irreversible joint damage early in the disease process, treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) should not be delayed for patients with confirmed RA and persistent synovitis. The major traditional DMARDs used for the treatment of RA include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methotrexate</a> &ndash; Methotrexate (MTX) is the cornerstone of therapy for RA and is effective as monotherapy for many patients.

The immunosuppressive drugs have a variety of actions, generally interfering with combinations of critical pathways in the inflammatory cascade, while biologic agents each selectively inhibit B-cell activation, T-cell activation, or the function of a proinflammatory cytokine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F78362\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78362 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms of action'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Characteristics that affect the choice of agent in a given disease include the extent of organ involvement, the severity of disease within a particular organ, and the rate of disease progression. The urgency and degree of immunosuppression required will also affect drug choice. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Relative toxicities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The potential risks of adverse reactions can be minimized by regular clinical and laboratory assessment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F58710\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58710 \">table 2</a>). The risk to benefit ratio of any immunosuppressive drug varies with the presence of comorbid conditions that may predispose to adverse effects or poor outcomes and with other factors. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring for toxicity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The role of individual immunosuppressive drug therapies in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other systemic rheumatic diseases varies widely. The uses of these medications in the rheumatic diseases in which they are utilized are discussed in the topic reviews for each disorder.
