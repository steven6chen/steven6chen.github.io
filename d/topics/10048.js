Patients are then re-evaluated at regular intervals during and after treatment to assess the response and detect possible recurrence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=staging-and-prognosis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Staging and prognosis of Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of classical Hodgkin lymphoma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review the long-term follow-up of patients treated with HL.

Following the completion of therapy and restaging after the documentation of complete response, patients are seen at periodic intervals to assess a possible relapse. When planning the post-treatment surveillance strategy, care should be taken to limit the number of computed tomography (CT) scans, particularly in younger individuals, given concerns about radiation exposure and the risk for second malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-follow-up-of-the-patient-with-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. There is no role for routine positron emissions tomography (PET) or <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> imaging in the longitudinal follow-up of asymptomatic patients after response assessment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-follow-up-of-the-patient-with-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-related-risks-of-imaging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation-related risks of imaging&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The majority (approximately 70 percent) of relapses occur within the first two years of diagnosis, and the risk of relapse declines thereafter. As an example, in one study of 1402 patients with HL followed for a median of 8.4 years, the risk of relapse within five years of diagnosis was 18 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-follow-up-of-the-patient-with-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The risk of relapse within the subsequent five years declined for patients who were relapse free at one year (10 percent), two years (5.6 percent), three years (3.5 percent), and five years (2.5 percent). After three years, the prognosis of patients with advanced-stage disease is comparable to that of early-stage disease.</p><p>Although the risk of relapse declines with time, there is no time point after which relapses no longer occur. A retrospective study of nearly 7000 patients observed no plateau for late relapses of HL, and reported 2.5, 4.3, and 6.9 percent cumulative incidence of relapse at 10, 15, and 20 years, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-follow-up-of-the-patient-with-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1167672609\"><span class=\"h2\">Overall approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following the completion of therapy, the frequency of visits and the nature of associated testing depend upon the comfort of both the patient and physician, and may be individualized based on clinical circumstances (eg, age, stage at diagnosis, initial treatment modality, social habits). The value and cost-effectiveness of different screening components are not supported by high level evidence, but are described below. (See <a href=\"#H1167672616\" class=\"local\">'Screening evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>Our general approach is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be seen at three- to six-month intervals during the first two years, every 6 to 12 months until year 3, and annually thereafter.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We do not obtain routine CT scans in the absence of clinical findings of potential relapse.

There have been no prospective randomized studies of routine follow-up in patients with HL. Retrospective reviews have shown that the majority of relapses are detected from the evaluation of symptoms rather than routine examination, blood tests, or imaging studies. Examples of such studies include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective review of 210 patients followed after having achieved a complete or partial remission showed 37 relapses detected in a total of 2512 clinic visits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-follow-up-of-the-patient-with-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Thirty relapses (81 percent) were diagnosed in symptomatic patients; one-half of these symptomatic relapses resulted in an earlier appointment being scheduled. In only four cases was relapse detected as a result of routine physical examination in an asymptomatic patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective cost and benefit analysis of routine follow-up examined 709 patients treated with radiotherapy for early-stage HL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-follow-up-of-the-patient-with-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Relapse occurred in 157 patients at a median of 1.9 years post-treatment. Relapse was suspected primarily by history in 55 percent of patients, physical examination in 14 percent, chest x-ray in 23 percent, and abdominal x-ray in 7 percent. Only one relapse was detected by a routine laboratory study.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A decision-analytic model evaluated three surveillance strategies in patients treated for HL: follow-up with non-CT modalities (ie, history, physical exam, routine blood work, and chest x-ray) or with these modalities (except chest x-ray) plus routine annual CT for 5 or 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-follow-up-of-the-patient-with-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Among those with early-stage disease, there was a decrease in quality-adjusted life expectancy for patients followed with CT compared with non-CT modalities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A population-based study of 2071 HL survivors reported that of 5352 CT scans performed in follow-up years two through five, only 125 were followed within six months by the administration of chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-follow-up-of-the-patient-with-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1167672623\"><span class=\"h2\">Sites of relapse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The site of relapse is partially determined by the type of initial therapy given.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1167672630\"><span class=\"h3\">After chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among patients treated with chemotherapy, relapse usually occurs in previous areas of involvement; new nodal sites tend to be adjacent to prior sites of disease (ie, extension) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-follow-up-of-the-patient-with-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. If, however, the patients also received complementary radiation therapy, relapse is more likely to occur in previously uninvolved nodal regions or extranodal sites such as the liver or lungs.

This was illustrated in a report from the Patterns of Care Study of the American College of Radiology where nodal areas treated to a dose of 30 to 45 Gy had a 4 percent in-field recurrence rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-follow-up-of-the-patient-with-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. There are randomized trials in stage I to II disease currently evaluating the radiation dose needed for in-field control.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1167672644\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP FOR LONG-TERM COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HL survivors are at risk of developing therapy-related complications that may present years after treatment (eg, second malignancies, cardiac disease, radiation-induced hypothyroidism) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-follow-up-of-the-patient-with-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. These complications have surfaced as significant causes of increased mortality among HL survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-follow-up-of-the-patient-with-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Screening for some of these entities is advised in the hope that early detection may lead to better management. As such, HL survivors should be assessed periodically to monitor for these potential complications.</p><p>The malignancies that can occur include acute myeloid leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and solid tumors such as lung cancer, breast cancer, and salivary gland carcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-follow-up-of-the-patient-with-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. The exact rates of secondary malignancy with the involved-field radiation technique used more commonly today is unknown, but predicted to be lower than that observed with more extensive radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-follow-up-of-the-patient-with-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. The risk of acute leukemia peaks at five to nine years, while the solid tumor risk is less increased initially but progressively increases after 10 years. Acute leukemia is primarily a complication of chemotherapy, non-Hodgkin lymphoma appears to be unrelated to the type of therapy, and both lung cancer and breast cancer are primarily related to radiation therapy, particularly mantle irradiation for breast cancer. Lung cancer rates are similar after radiation therapy alone or MOPP chemotherapy alone.

Cardiac irradiation has been associated with arrhythmias, myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease, pericarditis, myocarditis, pericardial effusion and tamponade, and sudden cardiac death, and the use of anthracyclines can significantly add to this risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/long-term-follow-up-of-the-patient-with-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].
