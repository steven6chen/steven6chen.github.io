They can develop de novo (primary), after radiation therapy (RT), or in the setting of chronic lymphedema of the arm or breast (therapy-related, secondary). Although the clinical features of breast sarcoma mimic those of breast carcinoma in some ways, therapy and prognosis differ dramatically.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12210078\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the rarity of breast sarcomas, there are no prospective randomized trials to guide therapy. Treatment principles have been derived from small retrospective case reviews of breast sarcomas and extrapolated from studies of nonbreast soft tissue sarcomas of the extremity and chest wall since clinical behavior, histology, and prognosis are similar.</p><p>As with soft tissue sarcomas arising in other areas of the body, a multidisciplinary approach at an experienced center involving surgical, radiation, and medical oncologists is preferred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-sarcoma-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In general, the choice of treatment is influenced by stage, histologic grade, and tumor size.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12210085\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery represents the only potentially curative modality for breast sarcomas. The type and extent of the operation is based upon both the size of the tumor and the size of the breast, as well as histology:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An adequate resection margin is the single most important determinant of long-term survival with breast sarcomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-sarcoma-treatment/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. For larger tumors (ie, those &gt;5 cm), the overall cosmetic result is often better with a mastectomy and reconstruction than with lumpectomy. Deep-seated tumors, which are close to or involve the chest wall, may require en bloc resection of the chest wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-sarcoma-treatment/abstract/3,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,6</a>]. With the exception of angiosarcomas, the majority of primary breast sarcomas are not multicentric [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-sarcoma-treatment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], and negative surgical margins are more important than the extent of surgical resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-sarcoma-treatment/abstract/2,7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7-9</a>]. Breast angiosarcomas (primary or therapy-related) often affect a much larger field of the breast or chest wall than anticipated, and mastectomy is the standard treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-sarcoma-treatment/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 100 cases of angiosarcoma treated with breast-conserving therapy demonstrated that the majority of patients recurred locally within one year (73 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-sarcoma-treatment/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Angiosarcomas often have infiltrative cutaneous disease that extends well beyond the visible tumor, and recurrences are often seen at the margins of the prior operation in a shotgun pellet pattern. Accordingly, special attention should be given to ensuring the skin margin is clear and margins of 3 cm have been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-sarcoma-treatment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Hence, the authors prefer a mastectomy rather than breast conservation surgery for this histology. Furthermore, given the high risk of recurrence with this histology, reconstruction should generally be delayed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In many cases, the wide excision of skin that is necessary to achieve negative margins precludes closure and requires a skin graft or myocutaneous flap. It is often wise to employ temporary coverage until the margin status on final pathology is known and perform definitive coverage in a delayed fashion. Frozen section analysis of the margins can be inaccurate as angiosarcomas tend to have low-grade changes at the margins that can be difficult to differentiate from radiation changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-sarcoma-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Resection by a surgeon with experience in this disease is advised.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12210092\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of regional nodes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breast sarcomas tend to spread by direct local invasion or hematogenously; regional lymph node involvement is rare except in the setting of widespread metastatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-sarcoma-treatment/abstract/2,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,15,16</a>]. The incidence of lymphatic spread is 5 percent or less overall, and lymphadenectomy does not appear to improve outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-sarcoma-treatment/abstract/5,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,17,18</a>]. While angiosarcomas in general have a higher rate of lymph node metastases as compared with other sarcoma subtypes, up to 13 percent in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-sarcoma-treatment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], the incidence is still relatively low, and prophylactic lymph node dissection is not indicated for a clinical negative axilla. Even when axillary lymphadenopathy is palpable, pathologic examination often reveals only reactive nodes without disease spread [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-sarcoma-treatment/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Despite this, the national surgical patterns of care study in the United States and the rare cancer network study in Europe found that approximately 40 percent of patients with primary breast sarcoma have some degree of regional lymphadenectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-sarcoma-treatment/abstract/17,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,21</a>]. Changing this practice could reduce unnecessary morbidity of treatment.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the patient with a clinically negative axilla, sentinel lymph node biopsy or axillary lymph node dissection is not routinely indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-sarcoma-treatment/abstract/7,13,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,13,22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the patient with clinically suspicious nodes, ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration of enlarged nodes can accurately document regional metastases. When lymph node metastases are detected in a patient with a breast sarcoma, the pathology should be reevaluated and a diagnosis of metaplastic carcinoma or carcinosarcoma should be considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-breast-cancer#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of breast cancer&quot;, section on 'Metaplastic carcinoma'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the diagnosis of lymph node involvement in a patient with breast sarcoma is confirmed and there is no evidence of distant disease, lymph node dissection is appropriate. Uncontrolled disease in the axilla can be associated with significant morbidity. Furthermore, nodal metastases do not carry the same poor prognostic implication as distant metastases in soft tissue sarcoma. As a result, regional nodal metastases were reclassified from stage IV to stage III disease in the 2010 modification of the American Joint Committee on <span class=\"nowrap\">Cancer/Union</span> for International Cancer Control <span class=\"nowrap\">(AJCC/UICC)</span> staging system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110711\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110711 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12210099\"><span class=\"h1\">ADJUVANT RADIATION THERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19021753\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary breast sarcomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The high rate of local recurrence after surgery alone (up to one-third in some series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-sarcoma-treatment/abstract/16,23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,23-25</a>]) provides the rationale for postoperative radiation therapy (RT). </p><p>The benefit of adjuvant RT for the treatment of primary breast sarcomas is controversial. There are no randomized trials that have been conducted in this subgroup, and the available observational series, mostly summarizing the experience of single institutions, provide conflicting data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-sarcoma-treatment/abstract/5,7,8,16,21,26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,8,16,21,26-29</a>]. While some have found no benefit for adjuvant RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-sarcoma-treatment/abstract/5,16,21,26,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,16,21,26,29,30</a>], others suggest improved outcomes, particularly for large, high-grade breast sarcomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-sarcoma-treatment/abstract/2,7,15,23,27,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7,15,23,27,31</a>]. Most of the benefit seems to be in reducing rates of locoregional recurrence; the impact on overall survival remains uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-sarcoma-treatment/abstract/2,7,8,26,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7,8,26,31</a>]. As an example, in a systematic review of 74 articles reporting on 222 patients, those managed with surgical resection and radiation therapy (n = 38) had a better local recurrence-free interval compared with patients managed by surgical resection alone (n = 151, 57 versus 34 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-sarcoma-treatment/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Other data to support benefit for RT in conjunction with surgery for primary breast sarcoma are extrapolated from randomized trials conducted in patients with nonbreast soft tissue sarcomas, which uniformly demonstrate improvement in local control but without an impact on survival. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-multimodality-treatment-for-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities-and-chest-wall#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of multimodality treatment for primary soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities and chest wall&quot;, section on 'Radiation therapy'</a>.)</p><p>A preference for preoperative as compared with postoperative external beam RT in patients with extremity sarcoma is based upon results from a randomized Canadian trial that demonstrated similar efficacy but a lower rate of generally irreversible late complications with preoperative therapy, including grade 3 to 4 fibrosis. None of the patients in this trial had primary breast sarcoma, and whether these benefits can be extrapolated to patients with breast sarcomas is unclear. These data are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-multimodality-treatment-for-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities-and-chest-wall#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of multimodality treatment for primary soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities and chest wall&quot;, section on 'Preoperative versus postoperative RT'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12210106\"><span class=\"h3\">Summary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The benefit of adjuvant RT for primary (de novo) breast sarcomas has not been proven in randomized trials. However, data extrapolated from randomized trials conducted in patients with extremity sarcomas suggest that RT reduces the rate of local recurrence, especially for high-grade or large tumors, which are associated with a higher rate of local recurrence. Our recommendations for adjuvant RT in patients with breast sarcoma parallel those for extremity sarcomas (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-multimodality-treatment-for-primary-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities-and-chest-wall#H1214006674\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of multimodality treatment for primary soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities and chest wall&quot;, section on 'Guidelines from expert groups'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest RT for breast sarcomas &gt;5 cm, especially if high-grade, and for patients with positive margins in whom reresection is not feasible. However, RT cannot compensate for inadequate surgery, and reexcision to ensure clean margins is strongly encouraged in these cases. For patients with large low-grade sarcomas, the risk to benefit ratio should be weighed carefully given the association of breast RT with long-term complications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adjuvant RT is also a reasonable option for selected patients with high-grade lesions between 2 and 5 cm (particularly aggressive tumors such as angiosarcomas in a previously unirradiated field). However, if wide margins (&gt;1 cm) are achieved with mastectomy, the risk to benefit ratio should be weighed carefully given the association of breast RT with long-term complications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patterns-of-relapse-and-long-term-complications-of-therapy-in-breast-cancer-survivors#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patterns of relapse and long-term complications of therapy in breast cancer survivors&quot;, section on 'Second cancers'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For large, deep tumors where the surgeon expects close or positive margins, preoperative RT may be considered in an attempt to increase resectability. However, if the surgeon feels that adequate margins are likely to be obtained, we prefer surgery initially, reserving the decision regarding RT until after review of the final pathology from the resection specimen.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12210113\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiotherapy-related breast sarcomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The benefit of adjuvant RT for radiation-related breast sarcomas is undefined, and in the setting of prior RT to the same area, the potential late effects of a high cumulative RT dose (rib fracture, pneumonitis, soft tissue necrosis) must be carefully considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-sarcoma-treatment/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. However, particularly for therapy-related angiosarcomas, the concern for late side effects must be counterbalanced by the high rate of disease recurrence with surgery alone (50 to 73 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-sarcoma-treatment/abstract/12,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,33</a>]. </p><p>Reirradiation, often with a hyperfractionated schedule of treatment administration, has been used in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting in some patients with favorable results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-sarcoma-treatment/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one series of three patients who received hyperfractionated RT for a secondary angiosarcoma after breast-conserving therapy for breast cancer, two could be resected following RT, and all three patients were described as recurrence-free for 22 to 39 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-sarcoma-treatment/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another report, the five-year survival rate for 14 patients with an angiosarcoma after breast-conserving therapy who were treated with hyperfractionated accelerated RT with or without surgery was 86 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-sarcoma-treatment/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Only two patients recurred locoregionally, while three developed metastatic disease.</p><p/><p>However, the available data on patients treated using these techniques are limited. These are challenging patients, and treatment must be individualized.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12210120\"><span class=\"h1\">ADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with adjuvant radiation therapy (RT), the role of adjuvant chemotherapy for breast sarcoma is undefined. Systemic chemotherapy is a routine component of treatment for several apparently localized soft tissue sarcomas that occur predominantly in children (ie, rhabdomyosarcoma). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-chemotherapy-for-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy for soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities&quot;, section on 'Pediatric-type sarcomas'</a>.)</p><p>However, despite many randomized trials, the role of adjuvant chemotherapy for the more common adult subtypes of soft tissue sarcoma (such as liposarcoma, synovial sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, and angiosarcoma), including those that arise within the breast, is uncertain. Pooled analyses from multiple studies provide the largest amount of patient data; however, they remain difficult to interpret based on inclusion of soft tissue sarcoma of differing grades, sites, and histologies as well as disparities in treatment used. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-chemotherapy-for-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy for soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An analysis from the Sarcoma Meta-Analysis Collaboration (SMAC) suggests a significant 11 percent improvement in survival for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a> and ifosfamide-based adjuvant chemotherapy compared with resection alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-sarcoma-treatment/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>However, a pooled analysis of individual patient data from the two largest adjuvant trials of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a> and ifosfamide-based chemotherapy (both performed by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC], only one of which was included in the SMAC meta-analysis) was negative for any survival advantage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-chemotherapy-for-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy for soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities&quot;, section on 'Pooled analysis of the EORTC trials'</a>.)</p><p/><p>There are no trials specifically addressing the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy for breast sarcomas. While one retrospective analysis suggests improved disease-free survival and a trend toward improved survival for patients who received adjuvant chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-sarcoma-treatment/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], and another suggests improved local control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-sarcoma-treatment/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], others report no benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-sarcoma-treatment/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Furthermore, in most studies, chemotherapy responsiveness, as judged by response rates to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, was limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-sarcoma-treatment/abstract/2,21,22,24,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,21,22,24,39</a>]. As a result, it is difficult to conclude from any of these series that adjuvant chemotherapy is definitely beneficial.</p><p>We generally discuss adjuvant chemotherapy as an option with patients who have a good functional status and a high-risk localized sarcoma, specifically stage III disease as defined by the Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) staging system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110711\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110711 \">table 1</a>). This includes patients with a high-grade breast sarcoma that is &gt;5 cm in size or has nodal involvement. Given the relatively poor prognosis of angiosarcomas in the subset of patients with tumor size from 3 to 5 cm, adjuvant chemotherapy is reasonable, but only after extensive discussion of the potential risks and benefits. As in other soft tissue sarcoma settings, if adjuvant chemotherapy is administered, we prefer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ifosfamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ifosfamide</a> in combination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-protocols-for-soft-tissue-and-bone-sarcoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment protocols for soft tissue and bone sarcoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-chemotherapy-for-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy for soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For patients with treatment-related sarcomas, the treatment issues are more complicated and this necessitates individualized decision-making. Patients who have received prior anthracycline-based chemotherapy may not be candidates for additional doxorubicin-based chemotherapy, even if they have a stage III tumor, because of the excessive risk of cardiotoxicity with higher cumulative doses of anthracycline. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-management-of-anthracycline-cardiotoxicity#H3045623246\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and management of anthracycline cardiotoxicity&quot;, section on 'Modification of anthracycline chemotherapy'</a>.)</p><p>If these patients have high-risk angiosarcomas (&gt;5 cm), a histology for which taxanes are effective in the setting of advanced disease, an adjuvant taxane-based chemotherapy regimen is reasonable but only after a frank discussion of the risks, benefits, and lack of available data proving efficacy in the adjuvant setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-treatment-of-metastatic-soft-tissue-sarcoma#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic treatment of metastatic soft tissue sarcoma&quot;, section on 'Taxanes and angiosarcoma'</a>.)</p><p>Another group of patients with treatment-related sarcomas presenting a particular challenge are those who have radiation-associated sarcomas who are not candidates for additional radiation. Depending on the tumor location, sometimes very close or positive margins are achieved and additional resection for wide margins is not possible without significant morbidity. If these patients have high-grade tumors, regardless of size (although typically over at least 3 cm), adjuvant chemotherapy is sometimes offered to improve local control when usual measures are not possible.</p><p>These general treatment principles are in keeping with consensus-based guidelines from the <a href=\"http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp&amp;token=yAtQYciL7uywmW3eRYUeJ4aK0dRx4JGGLufx5fCsL/3GEnpty51PpRmw8L7qDt7YvrmdE8jMEGNSa6WMQQkRzhg6guWN9QugGEPeOqp3ljo=&amp;TOPIC_ID=83132\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)</a> and the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/breast-sarcoma-treatment/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], which suggest that the appropriateness of adjuvant chemotherapy be addressed on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the patient's performance status, comorbid factors (including age), disease location, tumor size, and histologic subtype. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-chemotherapy-for-soft-tissue-sarcoma-of-the-extremities#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy for soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities&quot;, section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26983248\"><span class=\"h2\">Summary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adjuvant chemotherapy cannot be recommended routinely after resection of a breast sarcoma. The appropriateness of adjuvant chemotherapy must be addressed on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the patient's performance status, comorbid factors (including age), disease location, tumor size, and histologic subtype. Adjuvant chemotherapy is a reasonable option for patients with high-risk primary (stage III, as defined by TNM staging system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110711\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110711 \">table 1</a>)) or recurrent sarcomas, and because of their worse outcome, for angiosarcomas between 3 and 5 cm in size.</p><p>In all of these settings, the potential for benefit must be discussed in the context and potential of expected treatment-related toxicities including sterility in younger individuals, cardiomyopathy (particularly in patients with therapy-related breast sarcomas, who may have received prior doxorubicin-based adjuvant chemotherapy), renal damage, second cancers, and overall impairment of quality of life.

Most of the patients were treated with surgery, and some also received adjuvant treatment.

The incidence of lymphatic spread is low for most soft tissue sarcomas, and lymphadenectomy does not improve outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H12210092\" class=\"local\">'Management of regional nodes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Preoperative RT may be considered for large, deep tumors in a previously unirradiated field where the surgeon expects close or positive margins.

We suggest the addition of adjuvant RT to surgical resection for high-grade primary breast sarcomas that are &gt;5 cm and for patients with positive margins in whom reresection is not feasible (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We also suggest adjuvant RT for patients with high-grade lesions &le;5 cm who have a radiation-therapy-na&iuml;ve angiosarcoma, especially if margins are close (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>), given the high locoregional recurrence rate.

The amount of additional RT that may be given in a previously irradiated field is limited, and toxicities are greater.
