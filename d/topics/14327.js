However, the presentation may be atypical and include a spectrum of disturbances in calcium homeostasis, ranging from symptomatic severe hypercalcemia (parathyroid crisis) to normocalcemic PHPT.</p><p>The clinical manifestations that are directly related to PHPT will be reviewed here. Symptoms and signs (gastrointestinal, neuromuscular, renal, and psychological) that are likely related to hypercalcemia are also discussed elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hypercalcemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hypercalcemia&quot;</a>). It should be recognized, however, that the distinction is to some extent arbitrary.</p><p>The clinical manifestations of the familial forms of PHPT and of parathyroid cancer, and the diagnosis and management of PHPT, are also reviewed separately.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parathyroid-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parathyroid carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-hyperparathyroidism-diagnosis-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary hyperparathyroidism: Diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-hyperparathyroidism-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary hyperparathyroidism: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H676783\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common clinical presentation of PHPT is asymptomatic PHPT. Atypical presentations include normocalcemic PHPT and parathyroid crisis. The classical manifestations of PHPT (&quot;bones, stones, abdominal moans, and psychic groans&quot;) are uncommon in the United States but are still prevalent in other countries, especially developing ones.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biochemical screening tests that include measurements of serum calcium currently account for the identification of at least 80 percent of patients with PHPT in Western countries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F62696\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62696 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These patients are usually asymptomatic and have mild and sometimes only intermittent hypercalcemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. In most asymptomatic patients, the mean serum calcium concentration is less than 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> above the upper limit of the normal range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In most patients, serum calcium and PTH levels remain stable, although they may increase over time in a small subset (&lt;5 percent) of subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-hyperparathyroidism-diagnosis-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary hyperparathyroidism: Diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some patients with presumed asymptomatic PHPT, when carefully questioned, have nonspecific symptoms, such as fatigue, weakness, anorexia, mild depression, and mild cognitive or neuromuscular dysfunction, and others simply miss work often [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>]. With time, some patients with true asymptomatic PHPT may develop clinical manifestations of PHPT, including skeletal manifestations, nephrocalcinosis, or kidney stones. Thus, the differentiation between symptomatic and asymptomatic PHPT is not always clear-cut [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>There are no specific physical findings of PHPT. Parathyroid adenomas are rarely palpable, and if a neck mass is palpated in a patient with PHPT, the diagnosis is more likely to be thyroid nodule or parathyroid carcinoma (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parathyroid-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parathyroid carcinoma&quot;</a>). Band keratopathy (deposition of calcium phosphate in the exposed areas of the cornea) is rare and occurs only when serum calcium and phosphate concentrations are both high. A slit-lamp examination is usually needed to detect the keratopathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H676694\"><span class=\"h2\">Normocalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increasingly, patients undergoing evaluation for low bone density or other conditions may have parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels drawn in the absence of hypercalcemia. In 2009, an international panel of experts recognized this phenotype of PHPT in which PTH levels are elevated but serum calcium is normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In order to make this diagnosis, certain conditions must be met. In particular, all secondary causes for hyperparathyroidism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F73157\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73157 \">table 1</a>) must be ruled out, and ionized calcium levels should be normal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-hyperparathyroidism-diagnosis-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary hyperparathyroidism: Diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>There are few data on the clinical manifestations of this entity, termed normocalcemic PHPT. Patients without an apparent secondary cause may have a &quot;forme fruste&quot; of PHPT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. It might be expected that early in the natural history of PHPT, elevated PTH levels would precede the development of overt hypercalcemia. In these patients, the serum calcium concentration would be expected to rise above the upper limit of normal when followed over time.</p><p>In one prospective study of 37 patients with normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism, 41 percent developed evidence for progressive hyperparathyroid disease during a median of three years (range, one to eight) of observation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, less than 20 percent of patients became hypercalcemic during the observation period. Instead, some persistently normocalcemic patients developed other indications of progressive disease, such as kidney stones, hypercalciuria, bone loss, and fracture. Furthermore, four individuals with normal serum calcium levels had successful parathyroid surgery.</p><p>There are no data to suggest that all these patients will ultimately become hypercalcemic, and over what time period. In addition, since most of these patients were identified in the course of an evaluation for osteoporosis, fracture, or low bone density, they may not represent an early form of asymptomatic PHPT but could instead represent a unique phenotype of the disease. Identification of the normocalcemic patients who represent the true clinical precursor of hypercalcemic, asymptomatic PHPT would probably require population screening, which we do not recommend.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H676991\"><span class=\"h2\">Parathyroid crisis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parathyroid crisis is rare; the risk in a patient with known PHPT was estimated at 1 to 2 percent in two long-term studies of untreated patients with mild PHPT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. Parathyroid crisis is characterized by severe hypercalcemia, with the serum calcium concentration usually above 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> and marked symptoms of hypercalcemia: in particular, central nervous system dysfunction. In some cases, the syndrome occurs in patients with previously documented PHPT that is not severe. In others, it is the first evidence of parathyroid disease.</p><p>In a review of 48 cases of parathyroid crisis, the numbers of women and men were similar, the mean age was 55 years, and the mean serum calcium concentration was 17.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (4.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Of the 38 patients for whom clinical information was available, the following characteristics were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in mental status were common; 20 patients were comatose and the remaining 18 were confused.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sixty-nine percent had bone disease, as assessed by plain radiography or radionuclide bone scan.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fifty-three percent had nephrolithiasis, and 50 percent had both bone disease and nephrolithiasis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum PTH concentrations were, on average, 20 times the upper limit of normal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One-fourth of the patients were known to have had hypercalcemia at some time in the preceding 10 years.</p><p/><p>Other clinical problems included severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, peptic ulcer, and pancreatitis.</p><p>Another report compared 54 patients with parathyroid crisis with 460 patients treated at the same hospital for PHPT without hypercalcemic crisis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. There were more patients younger than 40 years old among those with parathyroid crisis (20 versus 5 percent).</p><p>The mechanism for the development of parathyroid crisis is not known but may be related to an intercurrent illness (often of a life-threatening nature), volume depletion, or infarction of a parathyroid adenoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Classical</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classical symptoms and signs of PHPT reflect the combined effects of increased PTH secretion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F69796\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69796 \">table 2</a>) and hypercalcemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F54647\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54647 \">table 3</a>). These are known as the &quot;bones, stones, abdominal moans, and psychic groans.&quot; The abnormalities directly associated with hyperparathyroidism are nephrolithiasis and bone disease; both are due to prolonged PTH excess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/1,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,21</a>]. Symptoms attributable to hypercalcemia include anorexia, nausea, constipation, polydipsia, and polyuria. Symptoms in PHPT are not necessarily related to serum calcium levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]; however, they seem to be more common in patients in whom hypercalcemia develops rapidly. (See <a href=\"#H676991\" class=\"local\">'Parathyroid crisis'</a> above.)</p><p>Although bone disease and stone disease are the universally accepted classical manifestations of PHPT, clinical parathyroid bone disease (osteitis fibrosa cystica) is rarely seen in the United States today (&lt;5 percent of patients), and the incidence of nephrolithiasis has declined over the last few decades. Nevertheless, nephrolithiasis remains the most common complication of PHPT, occurring in approximately 15 to 20 percent of newly diagnosed patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/1,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,21</a>]. In addition, classical manifestations of PHPT are still prevalent in developing countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. As an example, in a study of 464 patients (mean age 41 years) with PHPT from India, bone pain (56 percent), renal calculi (31 percent), and <span class=\"nowrap\">weakness/fatigability</span> (59 percent) were the most common symptoms at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The geographical differences in the clinical manifestations of PHPT may be explained, at least in part, by the greater prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in some countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>]. Vitamin D deficiency is common in patients with PHPT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In countries where hypovitaminosis D is prevalent, PHPT may be characterized by overt, severe clinical bone and stone disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Individuals with vitamin D deficiency and hyperparathyroidism have more clinically significant disease, including larger adenomas, higher concentrations of PTH, increased bone turnover, and more frequent fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>].</p><p>Evaluation for and management of vitamin D deficiency in patients with PHPT are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-hyperparathyroidism-management#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary hyperparathyroidism: Management&quot;, section on 'Concomitant vitamin D deficiency'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-hyperparathyroidism-diagnosis-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation#H3565203\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary hyperparathyroidism: Diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Serum vitamin D'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Osteitis fibrosa cystica</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classic manifestation of PHPT bone disease is osteitis fibrosa cystica, which is characterized clinically by bone pain and radiographically by subperiosteal bone resorption on the radial aspect of the middle phalanges (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F87019\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef87019 \">image 1</a>), tapering of the distal clavicles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F87017\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef87017 \">image 2</a>), a &quot;salt and pepper&quot; appearance of the skull (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F87018\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef87018 \">image 3</a>), bone cysts, and brown tumors of the long bones (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F87016\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef87016 \">image 4</a>). Brown tumors result from excess osteoclast activity and consist of collections of osteoclasts intermixed with fibrous tissue and poorly mineralized woven bone. The brown coloration is due to hemosiderin deposition.</p><p>Osteitis fibrosa cystica is now very rare in the United States. It occurs more typically in patients with severe disease, especially those with parathyroid carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In a review of 97 cases of mild PHPT, as an example, conventional radiography revealed signs of bone disease in only one patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. On the other hand, bone disease remains a major problem in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism due to chronic renal failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-chronic-kidney-disease-mineral-and-bone-disorder-ckd-mbd\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Nephrolithiasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nephrolithiasis is the universally accepted, classical renal manifestation of PHPT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F65839\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65839 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Nephrolithiasis occurs in approximately 15 to 20 percent of patients with PHPT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]; conversely, approximately 5 percent of patients with nephrolithiasis have hyperparathyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Nephrocalcinosis is much less common, although most studies of PHPT have not reported its frequency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nephrocalcinosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nephrocalcinosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Among normocalcemic patients with nephrolithiasis, PHPT should be suspected if the serum calcium concentration is in the high-normal range because the hypercalcemia may be intermittent and detected only by multiple measurements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/3,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,35,36</a>]. In one series of 48 patients with nephrolithiasis and PHPT, 30 patients (63 percent) had serum calcium concentrations between 10.2 and 11 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (2.55 and 2.75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Most stones in patients with PHPT are composed of calcium oxalate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], although a slightly alkaline urine may favor the precipitation of calcium phosphate stones. Contributing factors for calcium oxalate stone formation in PHPT include hypercalciuria; hyperoxaluria; hypocitraturia; dietary risk factors, such as a low calcium intake, high oxalate intake, high animal protein intake, high sodium intake, low fluid intake; and a high serum calcitriol concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>]. The high serum calcitriol concentration, caused by PTH stimulation of renal hydroxylation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D), may contribute to both hypercalciuria and stone formation.</p><p>The presence of subclinical nephrolithiasis in asymptomatic patients is reviewed below.

In classical PHPT, a neuromuscular syndrome characterized by atrophy of type II muscle fibers was seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. However, that syndrome, as well as any objective evidence of myopathy or weakness, is rarely seen today [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>In some more severely affected patients, neuromuscular symptoms may improve after cure. In one report, muscle strength and fine motor movement increased four weeks after parathyroidectomy in all nine patients with PHPT but not in a control group who underwent surgery for nodular goiter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

These symptoms include lethargy, depressed mood, psychosis, decreased social interaction, and cognitive dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The exact prevalence of such abnormalities is not well defined due to the lack of rigorous assessment for symptoms in many studies, the small size of the studies, and the wide variations in the instruments used to assess such disturbances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>As an example, in a case-control study comparing 39 postmenopausal women with mild PHPT with 89 postmenopausal controls without PHPT, symptom scores for depression and anxiety were higher, and performance on tests of verbal memory and nonverbal abstraction was worse in women with PHPT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. After parathyroidectomy, depressive symptoms, nonverbal abstraction, and some aspects of verbal memory significantly improved.</p><p>Since 2002, three randomized clinical trials have been published, assessing the effect of parathyroidectomy versus nonintervention in mild PHPT on, among other things, neuropsychiatric symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>]. Data suggest modest differences, favoring surgical intervention. However, the differences are very small, not specific across the studies, and of uncertain clinical significance. These trials are reviewed in detail separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-hyperparathyroidism-management#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary hyperparathyroidism: Management&quot;, section on 'Neuropsychiatric'</a>).

However, the reduction is usually small [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

Although PTH directly stimulates the distal tubular reabsorption of calcium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], this effect is overshadowed by the increase in filtered calcium due to hypercalcemia, leading to increased urinary calcium excretion in 35 to 40 percent of patients with PHPT. However, urinary calcium excretion per gram creatinine does not necessarily differentiate patients with or without stones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

However, the impact of milder PHPT on cardiovascular mortality is uncertain. Excess mortality, mostly due to cardiovascular disease, has been reported in a number of Scandinavian studies of patients with PHPT (relative risk [RR] ranging from 1.2 to 2.0) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/113-117\" class=\"abstract_t\">113-117</a>].

Whereas in one study excess mortality was best predicted by the serum calcium concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>], in other studies excess mortality was noted even in the presence of mild hypercalcemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/115,118,119\" class=\"abstract_t\">115,118,119</a>].</p><p>The largest study to date on this subject was conducted on 10,995 Swedish patients with PHPT who underwent parathyroidectomy between 1958 and 1997 (identified through the Cancer and Causes of Death Registries) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>]. Mortality, primarily cardiovascular, was increased (standard mortality ratio of 1.2) in the overall group and persisted up to 15 years postparathyroidectomy. It was noted in both genders and all age groups. However, in the subset of 6386 patients operated on between 1985 and 1997, there was no increase in mortality. Possible speculations for the decreased mortality in the latter subset include a milder clinical presentation or earlier surgical intervention. Surprisingly, a previously published Swedish study conducted on 4461 patients operated in the same period, between 1987 and 1994, and using the same national Swedish registries, observed an increased mortality (RR 1.7 for men and 1.85 for women) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-hyperparathyroidism-clinical-manifestations/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>].

Patients with normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism typically come to medical attention in the setting of an evaluation for low bone mineral density.

(See <a href=\"#H676991\" class=\"local\">'Parathyroid crisis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The classical symptoms and signs of PHPT, such as osteitis fibrosa cystica and nephrolithiasis, are due to prolonged excessive PTH secretion and hypercalcemia. Although osteitis fibrosa cystica is rarely seen in the United States and Europe, it is still prevalent in developing countries. The geographical differences in the clinical manifestations of PHPT may be explained, at least in part, by the greater prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in some countries. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Classical'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although many patients with PHPT have neuropsychologic complaints, the extent and attribution of these symptoms to PHPT in a given patient requires further elucidation. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Neuropsychiatric disturbances'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with PHPT may have decreased bone mineral density (BMD), in particular at more cortical sites (forearm and hip) as compared with more cancellous sites (spine). (See <a href=\"#H196421\" class=\"local\">'Skeletal'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Important subclinical renal manifestations of PHPT include asymptomatic nephrolithiasis, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, chronic renal insufficiency, and several abnormalities in renal tubular function: in particular, decreased concentrating ability (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F65839\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65839 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H937364\" class=\"local\">'Subclinical renal disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The nature of cardiovascular involvement and the impact of PHPT on cardiovascular mortality require further elucidation.
