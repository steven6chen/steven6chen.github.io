This can happen after a woman gives birth through the vagina (called a &quot;vaginal birth&quot;) or after a doctor does surgery to get the baby out (called a &quot;c-section&quot; or &quot;cesarean delivery&quot;).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16297534\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes postpartum hemorrhage?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most of the time, postpartum hemorrhage happens because the uterus does not contract (tighten) well after birth.</p><p>Others causes of postpartum hemorrhage are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tears of the vagina, cervix, or uterus</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small pieces of the placenta or membranes that stay stuck to the uterus after the baby is born. The placenta is the organ that forms between the mother and her baby. It brings the baby nutrients and oxygen and carries away waste (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F82935\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82935 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16297549\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of postpartum hemorrhage?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main symptom is bleeding from the woman's vagina. If the woman loses a lot of blood, she might feel weak and lightheaded.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16297564\"><span class=\"h1\">How is postpartum hemorrhage treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the hemorrhage happens because the uterus has not contracted well, treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Massaging the uterus &ndash; A nurse, doctor, or midwife will use his or her hands to press down on the woman's lower belly and massage the uterus. This helps the uterus contract.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines that help the uterus contract and slow down bleeding</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Checking to see if there are bits of the placenta and membranes stuck in the uterus. If so, the doctor or midwife will remove them. He or she might use tools to remove the tissue.</p><p/><p>If the hemorrhage happens because of injuries or tears, the doctor or midwife will stitch up any tears. If the bleeding is very severe, a woman might need a blood transfusion. For a transfusion, blood donated by someone else is given through an &quot;IV&quot; (a tube that goes into a vein).</p><p>If these treatments don't stop the bleeding, there are other treatments the doctor can try. If none of the treatments work, the doctor might have to take out the woman's uterus (called a &quot;hysterectomy&quot;). But that is rarely needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16297579\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant again?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most of the time, a postpartum hemorrhage does not happen again in future pregnancies. But make sure your doctor or midwife knows about your past postpartum hemorrhage. Compared with women who have not had a postpartum hemorrhage, you have a higher chance of having the problem again.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16297594\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=labor-and-delivery-childbirth-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Labor and delivery (childbirth) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=c-section-cesarean-delivery-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: C-section (cesarean delivery) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donation-giving-blood-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Blood donation (giving blood) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hysterectomy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hysterectomy (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=c-section-cesarean-delivery-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: C-section (cesarean delivery) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-hysterectomy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Abdominal hysterectomy (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
