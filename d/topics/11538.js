NOTES is evolving rapidly, presenting seemingly limitless possibilities for innovation, technique, and device development.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EXPERIMENTAL EVOLUTION AND DEVELOPMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The concept of flexible transluminal endoscopy, a term used before NOTES was coined, was first developed by a multicenter team of investigators (the Apollo Group) in the late 1990s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-orifice-transluminal-endoscopic-surgery-notes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The publication of the initial animal studies generated a wave of enthusiasm, and many centers began experiments of their own, using the NOTES approach for a variety of operations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-orifice-transluminal-endoscopic-surgery-notes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These have ranged from diagnostic explorations of the peritoneal cavity to complex organ resections including pancreatectomy, splenectomy, and nephrectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-orifice-transluminal-endoscopic-surgery-notes/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p>The initial approach was transgastric, but more recently NOTES has been performed through several other orifices, resulting in transcolonic, transvaginal, and <span class=\"nowrap\">transurethral/transcystic</span> approaches. The approach has also been extended from the peritoneum to other compartments in the body, such as transesophageal approaches to the mediastinum and heart, transgastric intrauterine interventions in pregnant animals, and novel approaches to the vertebral column [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-orifice-transluminal-endoscopic-surgery-notes/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>].</p><p>Given this flurry of activity and mounting enthusiasm, in 2005 the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and the Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopic Surgeons came together in a consortium (the <a href=\"http://www.noscar.org/&amp;token=e5oLmnOyM6dVs7PxdZIpDAFBqFKlaWZ1GkZyyZq6jrs=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2654\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Natural Orifice Surgery Consortium for Assessment and Research</a>) to provide consensus and guidelines on how best to bring this procedure to the clinical mainstream. In the last few years, an increasing number of NOTES procedures in humans have been performed. However, technological limitations of the current flexible platforms have been a major challenge, limiting the adoption of this approach (to date) to a few major medical centers. Nevertheless, while it is still too early to predict its ultimate role and value, it is clear that NOTES has dramatically altered our perceptions of how to approach gastrointestinal surgery.</p><p>A strong argument can be made that NOTES has been instrumental in the resurgence of lesser invasive surgical techniques such as single-incision laparoscopic surgery, which for some may represent a bridge to NOTES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-orifice-transluminal-endoscopic-surgery-notes/abstract/10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-14</a>]. Furthermore, developmental efforts in NOTES have resulted in numerous advanced surgical and endoscopic technologies that are now being applied in conventional laparoscopic and endoscopic techniques. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PREMISE AND PROMISE OF NOTES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interventions in the peritoneal cavity were historically performed by laparotomy. In the late 1980s and 1990s, laparoscopic surgery became widely popularized as a less invasive, cosmetically more appealing approach, and it is now commonplace in general surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-orifice-transluminal-endoscopic-surgery-notes/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>At the same time, there has been a dramatic increase in the complexity of endoluminal gastroenterologic procedures. These approaches differ significantly in the kind of access and viewing perspective they provide and the types of therapeutic maneuvers they enable. </p><p>Although NOTES procedures have been successfully (and apparently safely) reproduced in animal models, most investigators who have tried to implement NOTES in humans have encountered technical difficulties and sometimes even ethical challenges. These issues appear to be lessened by implementation of hybrid approaches, using a combination of laparoscopic, intraluminal, and transluminal (NOTES) procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-orifice-transluminal-endoscopic-surgery-notes/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. However, the ultimate goal of NOTES is to eliminate the laparoscopic component altogether and perform surgery using access provided by the &quot;natural orifices&quot; only (ie, the mouth, vagina, anorectum, or urethra).</p><p>Enthusiasm for these approaches stems from several reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-orifice-transluminal-endoscopic-surgery-notes/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The hypothesis that a &quot;hole&quot; in a viscus is better tolerated by the body than that in the abdominal wall, potentially leading to fewer complications such as ileus, pain, adhesions, and hernias when compared with laparoscopic surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elimination of an external scar, thereby leading to better cosmetic outcomes (which to some patients may be the most important advantage).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Better access to certain areas in the peritoneal cavity or in certain patients, such as those who are severely obese.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The potential for shorter hospitalizations and reduced healthcare costs.</p><p/><p>The evolution of laparoscopy was driven by patients, surgeons, and industry demand. A similar phenomenon may be evolving with NOTES. In a survey study of 100 patients considering laparoscopic cholecystectomy, 80 percent of respondents reported a theoretical preference for NOTES, based mainly upon the assumption that it would lead to less pain and fewer external scars [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-orifice-transluminal-endoscopic-surgery-notes/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. For those who preferred laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the most common reason was its proven safety and effectiveness. With regard to the choice of orifice used, both men and women preferred the mouth over the rectum or vagina. However, these outcomes were sensitive to the perceived risk. Thus, if the complication rate of NOTES was projected to double that of the laparoscopic approach, the preference for NOTES declined to 15 percent.</p><p>However, these views are already evolving. A survey of 300 women revealed that at least three-fourths of them would not favor NOTES via a transvaginal approach over laparoscopic cholecystectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-orifice-transluminal-endoscopic-surgery-notes/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. A possible reason for this was that many of the women, especially younger nulliparous women, expressed concerned about future sexual function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-orifice-transluminal-endoscopic-surgery-notes/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Patients in general may not fully understand the complexity of these approaches. Further, even with proper education and informed consent, opinion on the acceptability of the technique will also be influenced by cultural and geographic variations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most of the NOTES procedures in humans that have been performed have pushed the limits of currently available endoscopes and endoscopic accessories, leading to procedures that are far more complex, lengthy, and potentially riskier than they need to be. This is one reason why it is presently difficult, if not impossible, to directly compare laparoscopic and NOTES approaches. Fortunately, a number of platforms and tools are emerging that may render such studies feasible in the near future. Furthermore, even if they are not implemented for NOTES, these tools will help advance more conventional approaches, thus moving the whole field forward [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-orifice-transluminal-endoscopic-surgery-notes/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>The key technical elements in a NOTES procedure are access via a hollow viscus, performance of the desired maneuver once in the target cavity, and closure of the port upon exit. Many technical variations have been described for gaining safe access to the peritoneal cavity via a hollow viscus such as the stomach, but it is now generally accepted that a minimal incision (eg, using a needle knife or sphincterotome) followed by balloon dilation is preferred.</p><p>Although the endoscope can be inserted directly through the newly created stoma, some form of overtube is generally used to allow multiple entries and complex maneuvers. Choosing which viscus to use for access is determined, at least in part, by the location of the target organ and the potential for visualization and appropriate triangulation to the target.</p><p>As a general rule, the transgastric approach is best for lower abdominal and pelvic targets, whereas a transvaginal or transcolonic approach provides much straighter access to upper abdominal targets such as the gallbladder. This is important because many of the current instruments in use today are difficult to maneuver when the endoscope is retroflexed. When this general rule is not followed, spatial orientation during NOTES procedures can be very challenging to the surgeon. These technical constraints limit certain procedures to certain points of natural entry.</p><p>Another major set of limitations stems from the design of the contemporary flexible endoscopes, which were not intended to serve as a platform for complex surgical techniques. They do not provide the rigidity and ability to triangulate that is desirable in most instances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-orifice-transluminal-endoscopic-surgery-notes/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Technological advances, however, have a tremendous potential to transform this platform and make it capable of much more sophisticated maneuvers.</p><p>The final and perhaps most important technical challenge is to close the resultant viscerotomy in a secure, reliable, and safe manner. Indeed, a wider adoption of NOTES is critically dependent upon the safe and reliable closure of the viscerotomy and infection rates that are comparable, if not better than conventional techniques. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Limitations'</a> below.) From this perspective, the transvaginal route is easier to secure after exit, although theoretical long-term consequences such as dyspareunia and infertility need to be considered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">LIMITATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Bacterial contamination, peritonitis, and abscess formation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There will be some degree of bacterial contamination of the peritoneal cavity due to the viscerotomy and prolonged manipulation in the peritoneal cavity. A quantitative bacteriologic study in pigs showed a 20 to 40 percent incidence of abscesses and 40 to 60 percent incidence of significant contamination of the peritoneal fluid following NOTES, even in the absence of a leak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-orifice-transluminal-endoscopic-surgery-notes/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Although the abscesses were generally small, these studies suggest that bacterial infection is a potential threat that needs to be addressed carefully in clinical applications of NOTES. </p><p>Thus far in most clinical reports of natural orifice surgery, even though postoperative infections remain a great concern, there have been relatively few infections reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-orifice-transluminal-endoscopic-surgery-notes/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. A prevailing challenge is to develop an affordable, efficient, and high level of disinfection or sterilization process for complex fiberoptic endoscopic systems such as those that are utilized in NOTES.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Effects on the immune system and other physiological effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of animal models have been created to assess the physiologic, biochemical, and neurohormonal impact of NOTES access and manipulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-orifice-transluminal-endoscopic-surgery-notes/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. One report found that circulating levels of cytokines such as IL1 beta, IL6, and TNF-alpha were similar in animals immediately following a sham operation, open exploration, laparoscopy, or transgastric NOTES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-orifice-transluminal-endoscopic-surgery-notes/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, in the late postoperative period, there was a substantial decrease in TNF-alpha levels compared with the open and laparoscopic groups. The transgastric NOTES approach in rats is associated with a worse physiologic outcome in terms of gastric motility and peritoneal inflammation, but does not differ significantly from laparoendoscopic single-port surgery in activation of pain pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-orifice-transluminal-endoscopic-surgery-notes/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].The clinical significance of these observations remains unknown.</p><p>Another concern with a NOTES procedure is the possibility of over-insufflation of the peritoneal cavity and subsequent decreased venous return to the heart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-orifice-transluminal-endoscopic-surgery-notes/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Over-insufflation is prevented during laparoscopy by using pressure sensors, which are not currently available with standard endoscopy systems. There have been animal reports of successful monitoring of intra-abdominal pressures through the endoscope during NOTES; however, these findings have not been replicated in human studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-orifice-transluminal-endoscopic-surgery-notes/abstract/19,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Inability to deal with major complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Major bleeding, laceration, perforation of neighboring organs, and other complications occur with any major abdominal surgery, whether it is done via NOTES or any other access. However, it would be far more difficult to rapidly address these complications with a NOTES approach, given the limited range of instruments available for use through the flexible endoscope. Such complications would in all likelihood require conversion to a laparoscopic or open approach. </p><p>Complications have been reported to occur in 5.5 to 9.6 percent of procedures in different NOTES registries, with complications related to a transgastric approach being the most common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-orifice-transluminal-endoscopic-surgery-notes/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Reported complications include bleeding, bowel injury, biliary leaks, biliary fistulae, esophageal injury, and peritonitis. No mortality has been described, at least in the most current medical literature. Again, developments such as flexible endoscopic suturing devices may ameliorate some of these issues.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2359241173\"><span class=\"h2\">Training and credentialing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many surgeons are not comfortable using flexible endoscopic instruments, as their use requires a very different set of manual skills, hand-eye coordination, and perception than what most surgeons were trained in. Although this situation is changing as surgery programs increase flexible endoscopy training, this issue will likely remain a major limitation to the rapid adoption of NOTES or NOTES-like procedures. At the same time, very few gastroenterologists have both the skill set and the inclination to enter the peritoneal cavity. Even if they do, it is unlikely that they will be given credentials to perform these procedures by either their institutions or national boards. Overcoming these challenges will require a large, concerted effort involving investigators and agencies overseeing training and credentialing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2359241189\"><span class=\"h2\">Economic limitations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The implementation of NOTES demands formidable financial resources above and beyond those required for technology development. NOTES procedures are generally far lengthier than laparoscopic procedures, but lack established reimbursement codes that can provide appropriate compensation for the effort involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-orifice-transluminal-endoscopic-surgery-notes/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. This may limit NOTES techniques mainly to academicians, as private practitioners may find the opportunity cost prohibitive. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">HUMAN EXPERIENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since the inception of NOTES, thousands of human cases using NOTES have been reported and published, including 572 cases from a German registry and 362 cases from a Brazilian registry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-orifice-transluminal-endoscopic-surgery-notes/abstract/18,19,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19,32</a>]. However, only a handful of cases have been purely NOTES, requiring no laparoscopic instrumentation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2359241197\"><span class=\"h2\">Transvaginal NOTES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Presently, the transvaginal NOTES approach has been the most common and successful. Vaginal surgery and organ retrieval through the vagina have been reported for many years and demand very little in terms of infrastructure and highly-trained expertise. Closure of the vaginal entry is far less complex than any other NOTES entry. Also, the flexible vaginal walls allow extraction of even large organs. Its relative safety makes this approach more attractive than many other NOTES approaches; however, it is an option in women and requires that gastrointestinal specialists enter the world of gynecological surgery. </p><p>Most reports of transvaginal NOTES have utilized rigid instrumentation, either entirely or in addition to flexible endoscopy. There has been concern about the safety of using flexible endoscopy clips, especially for cholecystectomy. Such an argument has been the rationale for some to use conventional clips and, consequently, hybrid techniques. </p><p>Transvaginal NOTES has been used for several operations other than cholecystectomy and appendectomy in humans. Other procedures have included sleeve gastrectomy, colon resections, and even abdominal wall hernia repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-orifice-transluminal-endoscopic-surgery-notes/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>One account of the first 14 months of the German NOTES Registry reported a total of 572 target organs in 551 patients, of which cholecystectomy was the predominant operation (85 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-orifice-transluminal-endoscopic-surgery-notes/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The approach used was a transvaginal hybrid procedure. Complications occurred in approximately 3 percent, with conversions to laparoscopy or open surgery in approximately 5 percent. The conversion rate was dependent upon institutional case volume, obesity, and age. </p><p>In a second series with 102 patients who underwent transvaginal NOTES (72 cholecystectomies, 24 appendectomies, and 6 ventral hernia repairs), conversion to a traditional laparoscopic surgery was necessary in eight patients (8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-orifice-transluminal-endoscopic-surgery-notes/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. There were three major complications (3 percent) that included a rectal injury, an intra-abdominal abscess, and bleeding from an omental vessel. Minor complications occurred in seven patients (7 percent) and included urinary retention, transient brachial plexus injury, dislodgement of an intrauterine device, and vaginal granulation tissue.</p><p>Remaining challenges with this technique include potential dyspareunia, infertility, and a need to cannulate the bladder, which could potentially result in urinary infections, among the other potential complications previously described.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2359241214\"><span class=\"h2\">Transgastric NOTES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unlike the transvaginal approach, entry through the stomach demands a much higher degree of technological sophistication, especially for closure. A growing number of devices have been created for this purpose. Most have been utilized only in animal or cadaver models, and their results have been increasingly promising. Thus far, closure of the gastric access site in human NOTES has required laparoscopic assistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-orifice-transluminal-endoscopic-surgery-notes/abstract/19,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,34</a>].</p><p>Flexible endoscopic platforms are a must for this approach; however, all cases require some degree of hybridization. Procedures performed via a transgastric approach include appendectomy and cholecystectomy. Cancer staging and the retrieval of dislodged percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tubes have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-orifice-transluminal-endoscopic-surgery-notes/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. The frequency and severity of complications with the transgastric route are higher than those experienced with the transvaginal approach. While the transgastric approach seems applicable to nearly all patients, only relatively small specimens may be conducive to extraction through the mouth. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2359241231\"><span class=\"h2\">Miscellaneous approaches</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hybrid NOTES techniques have been successfully implemented in transcolonic, transesophageal, and <span class=\"nowrap\">transurethral/transcystic</span> approaches. One novel technique that is not transluminal, but involves entry through natural orifices, is the management of achalasia by per oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-orifice-transluminal-endoscopic-surgery-notes/abstract/37-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-43</a>]. In a prospective multicenter study with 70 patients who underwent POEM, remission rates at 3, 6, and 12 months were 97, 89, and 82 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-orifice-transluminal-endoscopic-surgery-notes/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In addition, three months after the procedure, the mean lower esophageal pressure was 9 mmHg, compared with 28 mmHg prior to the procedure. Advanced surgical procedures, such as sigmoidectomy for cancer, have been performed with a micro-assisted laparoscopy natural orifice surgery (MANOS) approach, but not yet using a true NOTES technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-orifice-transluminal-endoscopic-surgery-notes/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Transanal endoscopic microsurgery has also been extended at times to transluminal resections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-orifice-transluminal-endoscopic-surgery-notes/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">IMPLICATIONS BEYOND THE PROCEDURE ITSELF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Even if NOTES procedures are not widely adopted, a major benefit may be to embolden endoscopists to be more aggressive even with intraluminal procedures, with the knowledge that limited perforation of the gut may have no ill effects if repaired promptly. This will allow endoscopists to expand their therapeutic techniques to include resection of larger and deeper mucosal lesions, and to take full-thickness biopsies. A further benefit will come from the technological spinoffs from instrument development for NOTES. Many of these should be readily adaptable to intraluminal applications, enabling newer procedures. Finally, the advent of NOTES will have significant implications for the training of both gastroenterologists and surgeons, and has the potential for changing the way gastroenterology will be practiced in the future [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-orifice-transluminal-endoscopic-surgery-notes/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In some expert centers, natural orifice transluminal surgery (NOTES) is becoming an established alternative endoscopic and surgical technique. At such centers, some modified NOTES procedures are becoming routine under clinical trials (ie, Per Oral Endoscopic Myotomy [POEM] for achalasia).

However, some techniques are being implemented successfully in the clinical arena, even with basic endoscopic instrumentation (ie, POEM).

This development promises to close a gap and to bring NOTES to a clinical reality in the near future. </p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-orifice-transluminal-endoscopic-surgery-notes/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Pasricha PJ.
