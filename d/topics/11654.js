Epidural, combined spinal&ndash;epidural (CSE), and other central neuraxial techniques, including dural puncture epidural (DPE), single-shot spinal, and continuous spinal, are among the many options available to alleviate the pain of childbirth. In most cases, these techniques provide excellent analgesia with minimal risk to both mother and fetus.</p><p>This topic will discuss the indications, common techniques, and drugs used for neuraxial labor analgesia.

The techniques are usually easily performed, life-threatening complications are rare, and side effects such as pruritus and hypotension are transient or easily treated. The following general considerations apply to neuraxial analgesia for labor:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) concur that maternal request is sufficient indication for pain relief during labor, barring a medical contraindication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuraxial-analgesia-for-labor-and-delivery-including-instrumented-delivery/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuraxial analgesia must block T10 to L1 for the first stage of labor and extend to S2 to S4 during the late first stage and second stage of labor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuraxial analgesia may be initiated at any stage during labor, including in early labor and at full cervical dilation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Labor often progresses more quickly for parous patients than for nulliparous patients and, for all parturients, may be more intense at the later stages of cervical dilation and during the second stage of labor. Parous patients may require more rapid onset of neuraxial block that covers the sacral nerve roots.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain relief may improve the course of labor by blunting the adverse maternal cardiovascular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal effects of catecholamines. The provision of adequate labor analgesia may also improve uteroplacental perfusion and decrease the incidence of postpartum depression and persistent postpartum pain.

Similarly, routine type and screen or crossmatch is not necessary in healthy patients; as usual, sending a blood sample to the blood bank should be considered for parturients at risk of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) or for those at risk of having blood antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuraxial-analgesia-for-labor-and-delivery-including-instrumented-delivery/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Informed consent </strong>&ndash; Informed consent should include a discussion of the risks and benefits of available pain management options on the labor floor, as well as information about the anesthesiologist's role in the management of obstetric emergencies.

Ultrasound can be used to identify the interspace for needle placement and to estimate the distance from the skin to the epidural space. A systematic review including 31 clinical trials and one meta-analysis regarding pre-procedural neuraxial ultrasound reported that this tool facilitated identification of the correct lumbar intervertebral space more accurately than landmark palpation, accurately predicted the depth to the epidural or intrathecal space, and resulted in increased success and ease of performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuraxial-analgesia-for-labor-and-delivery-including-instrumented-delivery/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, ultrasound may be less useful for experienced practitioners and patients with easily palpable landmarks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuraxial-analgesia-for-labor-and-delivery-including-instrumented-delivery/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3281208937\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT POSITIONING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Optimal positioning is critical to the success of neuraxial procedures, and both the sitting and lateral decubitus positions are used effectively.</p><p>We recommend using the lateral position in specific clinical circumstances (eg, in the setting of advanced cervical exam, for patients with vasovagal syncope, or for those at increased risk of cord prolapse). Initiation of neuraxial block in the lateral position may facilitate fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring, reduce the risk of intravascular placement of the epidural catheter, enhance patient comfort during the procedure, and require less assistance from skilled support personnel. The sitting position may be particularly useful for larger patients in whom the bony landmarks are difficult to feel.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2066687392\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING DURING NEURAXIAL LABOR ANALGESIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During initiation and maintenance of neuraxial labor analgesia, the following monitors should be applied:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>During initiation of neuraxial analgesia </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Maternal oxygen saturation and heart rate (HR) should be measured continuously with the pulse oximeter, and blood pressure (BP) should be measured every five minutes for at least 15 to 20 minutes, until the patient is hemodynamically stable. Fetal HR (FHR) should be monitored at minimum before and after initiation of neuraxial analgesia and according to institutional protocol.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>During maintenance of neuraxial labor analgesia</strong> &ndash; Maternal BP should be measured every 30 minutes, or more frequently in the setting of maternal hypotension and during category 2 and 3 FHR tracings. FHR should be monitored as per American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and institutional protocol. Pain control, motor function, and sensory level, as needed, should be assessed at regular intervals to ensure a properly functioning block. We document the patient's vital signs and pain assessment, as well as the FHR, every one to two hours.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2787922613\"><span class=\"h1\">NEURAXIAL TECHNIQUES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H160518747\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Continuous epidural and combined spinal&ndash;epidural (CSE) are the most commonly used neuraxial techniques for labor analgesia. Many obstetric anesthesiologists use the CSE technique for all uncomplicated laboring patients. Single-shot and continuous spinal techniques may be used in selected clinical scenarios. Although the choice of technique must be individualized, the following general considerations apply:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spinal techniques (ie, the spinal portion of the CSE, single-shot spinal, continuous spinal) provide more rapid onset of symmetric analgesia, including sacral analgesia, than a conventional epidural technique.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continuous techniques (ie, continuous epidural, the catheter component of the CSE, continuous spinal) provide analgesia throughout labor and delivery, with the option to convert rapidly to surgical anesthesia for operative delivery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the functionality of the epidural catheter is not known at the onset of the block with the CSE technique, the evidence suggests that epidural catheters placed during CSE procedures are at least as reliable, or more reliable, than stand-alone epidurals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuraxial-analgesia-for-labor-and-delivery-including-instrumented-delivery/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epidural analgesia requires higher drug doses than spinal analgesia. In current clinical practice, low concentrations of local anesthetic (LA) are commonly used in epidural solutions. With these low-concentration epidural solutions, the risk of systemic toxicity is very low, even with inadvertent intravascular injection. However, high or total spinal anesthesia can occur if an epidural dose of medication is administered in an unrecognized spinal catheter.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1431154470\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidural versus CSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice between conventional epidural and CSE is often determined by the clinical situation, institutional norms, available equipment, and clinician preference.</p><p>The most important clinical difference between these techniques may be the faster onset of analgesia with the CSE compared with the conventional epidural. A systematic review of 27 trials involving 3200 patients found that the mean time of effective analgesia from the time of medication administration was approximately five minutes faster with CSE compared with epidural techniques, with significant heterogeneity related to technical differences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuraxial-analgesia-for-labor-and-delivery-including-instrumented-delivery/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In particular, the onset of sacral analgesia appears to be faster with spinal analgesia than with epidural analgesia; this may be particularly important for patients in advanced, rapidly progressing labor.</p><p>The quality of analgesia with the CSE versus epidural technique appears to be at least as good as that of an epidural, if not better. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials comparing CSE and epidural for labor reported that the risk of unilateral block was reduced with CSE, but there was no difference in the rates of epidural catheter replacement, unscheduled top-ups, or intravascular placement of the epidural catheter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuraxial-analgesia-for-labor-and-delivery-including-instrumented-delivery/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Both CSE and epidural techniques are usually easily performed, and there appear to be no differences in neonatal or delivery outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuraxial-analgesia-for-labor-and-delivery-including-instrumented-delivery/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The CSE technique is associated with a higher incidence of pruritus and transient fetal bradycardia, both of which appear to be opioid dose-dependent. Despite the need for dural puncture with CSE, the risk of postdural puncture headache (PDPH) does not appear to be increased with the CSE technique.

An epidural catheter is threaded through the needle into the epidural space; the needle is removed, and the catheter is secured and connected to an infusion pump system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1579791184\"><span class=\"h3\">Epidural anesthesia equipment</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Epidural kits</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Commercially prepared, sterile, disposable epidural trays are available from several manufacturers.

Nineteen-gauge epidural catheters (ie, adult wire-reinforced catheters) are paired with 17-gauge epidural needles and 20-gauge catheters, with 18-gauge needles. Commercially available epidural kits do not contain <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a> with alcohol (ie, ChloraPrep) because the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved its use for neuraxial procedures due to a lack of clinical testing. Nonetheless, its use for skin preparation before initiation of neuraxial blockade is advocated by both the ASA and the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Acute Pain Medicine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuraxial-analgesia-for-labor-and-delivery-including-instrumented-delivery/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].

Longer needles up to 15 cm (6 inches) in length are available for morbidly obese patients. Many commercially available epidural needles, including the Hustead, Weiss, and Tuohy needles, have a curved opening at the tip to guide the catheter into the epidural space. Wings at the junction of the needle shaft and hub may allow for better control as the needle is passed through tissue, although some practitioners may prefer epidural needles without wings, or with attachable wings.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Epidural catheter</strong> &ndash; A variety of epidural catheters are available. Distinguishing features include the degree of stiffness and tip design. Flexible designs have an inner stainless steel wire coil surrounded by either a polyurethane or a nylon-blend catheter, depending on the manufacturer. Nylon catheters without the spring-wound inner coil tend to be stiffer. Catheter tip designs differ in the number and arrangement of orifices (multi-orifice versus single end-hole) and flexibility of tip (flexible versus blunt) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F113619\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113619 \">figure 1</a>).

Spinal microcatheters (eg, 28-gauge) have again become available, although these catheters may be associated with a higher incidence of technical difficulty and catheter failure than epidural catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuraxial-analgesia-for-labor-and-delivery-including-instrumented-delivery/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p><strong>Continuous spinal technique</strong> &mdash; Continuous spinal technique is discussed separately.

Others choose to repeat the epidural procedure at a different interspace or to repeat the epidural procedure when there is difficulty threading the spinal catheter.</p><p>Evidence for the best strategy for neuraxial analgesia after ADP is inconclusive and is based on retrospective and observational studies. The effect of spinal catheter placement on the incidence of PDPH after ADP is discussed separately.

A review of 236 cases of ADP during epidural placement compared outcomes for patients managed with insertion of an intrathecal catheter with those who had a re-sited epidural catheter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuraxial-analgesia-for-labor-and-delivery-including-instrumented-delivery/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Intrathecal catheters were associated with a higher rate of failed analgesia requiring catheter replacement compared with re-sited epidurals (14 versus 2 percent).</p><p>The decision to place a spinal catheter or to re-site an epidural should be made quickly to avoid excessive egress of CSF from the large-bore epidural needle. If an epidural catheter is placed immediately after an accidental dural puncture with a large-bore needle, there may be increased effect from the administered LA for the first several hours. A reduced initial dose and basal rate may be required. In practice, in this setting, we administer a test dose of 3 mL <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> or 5 mL of the epidural loading dose through the catheter, and wait three to five minutes to gauge whether the patient has a higher-than-expected sensory and motor block. If not, we continue to administer the full loading dose in increments, as usual, assessing for motor and sensory block throughout. If the block is greater than anticipated, we titrate the loading dose to the desired effect.</p><p><strong>Mode of continuous spinal drug administration</strong> &mdash; The same <span class=\"nowrap\">LA/opioid</span> combination solution used for epidural analgesia may be used for continuous spinal analgesia (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a> 0.0625 to 0.1% with 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ropivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ropivacaine</a> 0.08 to 0.1% with 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> fentanyl). The drug delivery mode most commonly used for spinal infusions is the continuous infusion, but the rate must be decreased to 1 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour,</span> depending on the concentration (eg, 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> 0.1% bupivacaine, 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> 0.0625% bupivacaine), and slowly adjusted as appropriate; the demand bolus option should be eliminated. Most importantly, all members of the nursing, obstetric, and anesthesiology teams must be notified that the catheter is in the intrathecal space. We place &quot;intrathecal&quot; or &quot;spinal&quot; labels on the catheter, labor room door, infusion pump, and on the patient's chart.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3903379419\"><span class=\"h2\">Dural puncture epidural analgesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The dural puncture epidural (DPE) technique is essentially a CSE technique without injection of intrathecal drugs. The dura is punctured as though performing a CSE technique, the spinal needle is removed after visualization of CSF, the epidural catheter is inserted, and epidural analgesia is initiated. (See <a href=\"#H209842206\" class=\"local\">'CSE technique'</a> above.)</p><p>The literature on the effectiveness of DPE compared with continuous epidural analgesia shows more symmetric analgesia, faster onset of analgesia, and more extensive caudal spread with the use of a 25- or 26-gauge spinal needle, but not with the use of a 27-gauge needle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuraxial-analgesia-for-labor-and-delivery-including-instrumented-delivery/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>]. The suggested mechanism for improved analgesia is leakage of drugs across the dura from the epidural space to the subarachnoid space.</p><p>We occasionally use DPE to confirm epidural needle position when loss of resistance is equivocal. CSF flow through the spinal needle provides supportive evidence that the tip of the epidural needle is close to the dura and therefore likely in the epidural space. Attempting to thread the epidural catheter can also provide confirmation, although it is possible for any catheter (especially stiffer catheters) to thread along fascial planes or elsewhere outside of the epidural space.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3416574927\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinician top-ups</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinician-administered neuraxial bolus doses, or top-ups, may be required during labor despite an appropriate epidural loading dose and maintenance regimen. Breakthrough pain may result from obstetric or anesthetic issues, or a combination of the two. We use a systematic approach to the evaluation and management of pain during neuraxial labor analgesia, as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Assess the pain</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>The quality and location of pain may help determine the etiology and treatment. As examples, unilateral pain may suggest a problem with the epidural catheter, while increasing perineal pain may suggest progression of labor and inadequate sacral block. (See <a href=\"#H2075314283\" class=\"local\">'Pain relief'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Assess the anesthetic</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>The position of the epidural catheter and equipment function should be assessed. Confirm that the pump is appropriately delivering medication and that the patient is using self-administered boluses if the regimen includes PCEA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Check the sensory level of the block</strong> &ndash; Assess the bilateral sensory level to cold stimulus (eg, using alcohol swab or ice) and sharp touch. A low level (ie, below T10) may suggest a problem with the catheter or inadequate dosing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Check catheter position</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Confirm that the epidural catheter remains in the epidural space (eg, if loss of resistance was at 5 cm and the catheter was taped at 10 cm, confirm that the catheter remains at 10 cm at the skin). Subsequent steps depend on the catheter marking at the skin, as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>If the catheter looks as though it has moved out at all, have a very low threshold to replace it.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>If the catheter looks as though it has moved in, then it has likely moved into the subcutaneous tissue rather than into the epidural space; do not change its position.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>If the catheter was originally inserted more than 6 cm <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> has advanced several cm, withdraw the catheter so that no more than 6 cm remain in the epidural space to minimize the risk of unilateral block (see below).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>If the catheter appears to be appropriately placed and the sensory and motor block are equivocal, consider administering a more concentrated bolus dose (eg, 5 mL of 3% 2-chloroprocaine or 3 to 5 mL of 2% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>), which should produce a sensory and motor block. If the bolus does not produce a block, replace the epidural catheter.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Top-up</strong> &ndash; Once proper catheter placement is confirmed by visual inspection, then, depending on the source and degree of pain, consider a clinician top-up, as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span><strong>Mild pain</strong> &ndash; For a low sensory level with mild pain, either ask the patient to administer one or two PCEA boluses or provide a high-volume top-up with a dilute LA solution, with or without an opioid, similar to the epidural solution. Following this, consider increasing the basal pump rate or decreasing the bolus dosing intervals.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span><strong>Moderate to severe pain</strong> &ndash; If the pain is moderate to severe, the patient is likely to need a more concentrated bolus than her infusion (eg, 6 to 10 mL 0.125% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a> or 3 to 5 mL 0.25% bupivacaine), especially if her infusion is dilute (eg, 0.0625% bupivacaine with 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span><strong>Unilateral pain</strong> &ndash; Place the patient in the lateral position with her uncomfortable side down. Consider withdrawing the catheter 1 cm, depending on how far the tip is in the epidural space. Administer a bolus (eg, 6 to 10 mL of 0.125% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a> or 3 to 5 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine). If pain persists after 20 minutes, replace the epidural catheter.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span><strong>Pain after a CSE</strong> &ndash; A top-up may be required during a CSE technique once the intrathecal drug has worn off if the epidural component of analgesia has not yet been established. Consider an epidural bolus that is more concentrated than the labor epidural infusion if fast onset of analgesia is desired (eg, 3 to 5 mL of 0.25% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a> or 6 to 10 mL of 0.125% bupivacaine).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span><strong>Sacral pain</strong> &ndash; Sacral pain should raise the possibility that the patient is fully dilated and should prompt a discussion with the obstetrician or nurse for assessment. The patient may feel better or worse when she begins to push.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\">Options for clinician top-ups for sacral pain include a bolus of 6 to 10 mL of 0.125% or 3 to 5 mL of 0.25% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> 50 to 100 mcg of epidural <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a>.

The obstetrician may choose to perform a pudendal block.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span><strong>Persistent pain after bolus</strong> &ndash; If the patient remains uncomfortable or there is an inadequate sensory level after a top-up, consider replacing the catheter early. Once an epidural needs more than one or two unscheduled boluses, it is more likely to fail for both labor analgesia and for surgical anesthesia during cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neuraxial-analgesia-for-labor-and-delivery-including-instrumented-delivery/abstract/3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8</a>].

Neuraxial analgesia must block T10 to L1 for the first stage of labor and extend to S2 to S4 during the late first stage and second stage of labor. (See <a href=\"#H3070752803\" class=\"local\">'Indications for neuraxial analgesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absolute contraindications to neuraxial analgesia are rare. Some relative contraindications include coagulopathy, infection of the lower back, and increased intracranial pressure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continuous epidural and CSE are the most commonly used neuraxial techniques for labor analgesia. Single-shot and continuous spinal techniques may be used in selected circumstances. General considerations regarding the choice of technique include the following (see <a href=\"#H160518747\" class=\"local\">'Choice of technique'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Spinal techniques (ie, the spinal portion of the CSE, single-shot spinal, and continuous spinal) may provide a more rapid onset of symmetric analgesia, including sacral analgesia, than a conventional epidural technique.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Continuous techniques (ie, continuous epidural, CSE, continuous spinal) provide analgesia with the option to convert to anesthesia for operative delivery. (See <a href=\"#H1002636282\" class=\"local\">'Epidural analgesia technique'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1240214320\" class=\"local\">'Continuous spinal analgesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Single-shot spinal analgesia is limited by the duration of action of the intrathecal drug injected. The single-shot technique may be indicated for patients who are in rapidly advancing labor and are expected to deliver quickly, or when epidural catheter placement is technically prohibited. (See <a href=\"#H787079052\" class=\"local\">'Single-shot spinal analgesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The drugs used for neuraxial labor analgesia techniques usually include a combination of dilute local anesthetic (LA) and an opioid. The goal should be to use the lowest effective total dose of drugs to minimize motor block, avoid hypotension, minimize placental drug transfer, and reduce the chance of LA toxicity. The combination of LA with opioid allows the use of lower doses of each class of drug. (See <a href=\"#H535011679\" class=\"local\">'Neuraxial analgesia drug choice'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CSE analgesia is usually performed with a needle-through-needle technique, followed by insertion of an epidural catheter. CSE is initiated with subarachnoid injection of LA <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> opioid. (See <a href=\"#H209842206\" class=\"local\">'CSE technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For CSE or single-shot spinal analgesia, the combination of an opioid (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sufentanil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sufentanil</a>) with LA (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ropivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ropivacaine</a>) for intrathecal administration increases the duration and quality of analgesia and makes it possible to reduce the amount of each individual drug. We use a combination of fentanyl (10 to 15 mcg) with (plain) bupivacaine (2 to 2.5 mg). (See <a href=\"#H687104612\" class=\"local\">'Intrathecal analgesia drug choice'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continuous epidural analgesia is initiated with a bolus of a solution that usually includes a combination of LA with opioid, with or without an epidural test dose.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For epidural labor analgesia, we suggest the use of a high volume of low-concentration LA epidural solution, rather than a lower volume of high-concentration solution (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We generally administer a 15 to 20 mL bolus in 5 mL increments with aspiration between boluses, of 0.0625 to 0.1% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL,</span> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ropivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ropivacaine</a> 0.08 to 0.1% with fentanyl 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL,</span> with or without an epidural test dose (eg, 3 mL <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> 1.5% with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>), to initiate epidural analgesia.

To evaluate for intrathecal injection, wait up to five minutes to confirm that the patient is not developing a motor block. Caution should be used when administering an epinephrine-containing test dose in patients with hypertension or with uteroplacental insufficiency, as systemic epinephrine can precipitate profound hypertension and can theoretically decrease uteroplacental perfusion in these patients.

We replace unilateral, patchy, or otherwise nonfunctioning epidurals in parturients who remain uncomfortable after one or two unscheduled clinician top-ups. Replacing the catheter usually results in improved comfort.

Continuous spinal is also a reasonable option after an accidental dural puncture during attempted epidural placement.
