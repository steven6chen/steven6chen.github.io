The syndrome was originally described in association with the use of milk and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-milk-alkali-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Once a classic cause of hypercalcemia, the milk-alkali syndrome virtually disappeared with the advent of new therapies of peptic ulcer disease and, by 1985, was considered the cause of less than one percent of cases of hypercalcemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-milk-alkali-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>However, there has since been a resurgence of this disorder, and it may account for up to 12 percent of cases, making it the third leading cause of hypercalcemia behind primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-milk-alkali-syndrome/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].

The regimen included the hourly administration of milk or cream with Sippy powders (a powder containing 600 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-carbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium carbonate</a> and 600 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> alternating with a powder containing 600 mg of bismuth subcarbonate and 1200 to 1800 mg of sodium bicarbonate). Toxic reactions characterized by alkalosis and kidney injury were noted shortly thereafter, but the plasma calcium concentration was not measured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-milk-alkali-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In 1936, a report associated hypercalcemia with the alkalosis and kidney injury in patients treated with the Sippy regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-milk-alkali-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Despite these observations, therapy of peptic ulcer disease continued to include the administration of large doses (20 to 60 gm per day) of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-carbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium carbonate</a>, and less acute and more frequent cases were reported. Most cases were middle-aged men, the group with the highest incidence of peptic ulcer disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1941291\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The milk-alkali syndrome is caused by the ingestion of large amounts of calcium in conjunction with absorbable alkali. However, the fraction of the population at risk who develop sustained hypercalcemia, metabolic alkalosis, and kidney disease is relatively small. In one series of 1350 patients treated with the Sippy regimen, approximately 8 percent were affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-milk-alkali-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In another study, 297 heart and lung transplant recipients were prescribed large doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-carbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium carbonate</a> as prophylaxis for adverse effects of glucocorticoid immunosuppression. Sixty-five patients developed hypercalcemia; 31 were alkalotic at the time of the hypercalcemia, and 37 had an impairment in renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-milk-alkali-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>It is probable that normal renal function and the suppression of calcitriol production allow maintenance of calcium and acid-base balance in most individuals exposed to large doses of calcium and alkali. Under normal circumstances, the fractional intestinal absorption of filtered calcium declines markedly as calcitriol levels fall, and calcium intakes exceeding 4 grams per day are necessary to achieve normal serum levels in the absence of calcitriol. However, net calcium absorption increases markedly when intake is increased to 10 to 15 grams per day despite suppression of calcitriol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-milk-alkali-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In addition, some individuals may not adequately suppress calcitriol in response to large doses of calcium, resulting sequentially in hyperabsorption of calcium and hypercalcemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-milk-alkali-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1941358\" class=\"local\">'Possible role of calcitriol'</a> below.)</p><p>Although the mechanisms that initiate hypercalcemia are incompletely understood, clinical studies suggest that hypercalcemia underlies the subsequent metabolic derangements including alkalosis and acute kidney injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-milk-alkali-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Hypercalcemia produces the following effects in the kidney:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vasoconstriction, which decreases the glomerular filtration rate (GFR).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Activation of the calcium-sensing receptor in the medullary thick ascending limb, which inhibits the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter causing natriuresis.

The combined effects of increased alkali intake, volume depletion, and decreased GFR lead to metabolic alkalosis.</p><p>Alkalosis may contribute to the maintenance of both volume depletion (by enhancing the activity of the calcium-sensing receptor) and hypercalcemia (by increasing calcium reabsorption in the distal tubule via the pH-sensitive calcium channel, the transient receptor potential vanilloid member 5 [TRPV5]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-milk-alkali-syndrome/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Volume depletion due to vomiting or diuretics will also worsen the hypercalcemia and alkalosis.</p><p>Marked hypercalcemia can lead to an acute clinical presentation.

In published reports describing biochemical parameters in patients presenting with milk-alkali syndrome, plasma calcitriol concentrations appear to be quite variable and demonstrate no consistent pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-milk-alkali-syndrome/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>This issue assumes more importance in light of the emphasis on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-carbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium carbonate</a> intake for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis. While recommended doses are only 1.2 g per day, it is likely that some women, unless otherwise instructed, take higher doses. In the absence of a source of phosphate such as milk, calcium carbonate may produce mild hypophosphatemia, which directly increases the synthesis of calcitriol. Increased intake of calcium and alkali in association with high or even normal levels of calcitriol may predispose certain individuals to mild intermittent hypercalcemia at doses lower than those previously reported. Concurrent therapy with vitamin D, for either osteoporosis or secondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic kidney disease, makes the development of hypercalcemia much more likely. Individuals with mild chronic kidney disease, volume depletion, and those treated with a thiazide diuretic (which directly reduces calcium excretion) are also likely to be at increased risk.

Patients with chronic kidney disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-milk-alkali-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], including patients on dialysis, and pregnant women are also at increased risk. A less common risk factor for milk-alkali syndrome is nicotine-substitute chewing gum, which can provide a significant calcium load when utilized in large quantities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-milk-alkali-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The milk-alkali syndrome can present in a variety of ways that, in part, depend upon the amount and duration of the calcium and alkali ingestion, as well as the presence of risk factors such as thiazide diuretic use and volume depletion.</p><p>Most patients with the milk-alkali syndrome are women who take <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-carbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium carbonate</a>, often to prevent or treat osteoporosis.

One study found that the milk-alkali syndrome accounted for two percent of hospitalized patients with hypercalcemia between 1985 and 1989, as compared with 12 percent between 1990 and 1993 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-milk-alkali-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In another study, milk-alkali syndrome accounted for 8.8 percent of hypercalcemia cases between 1998 and 2003 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-milk-alkali-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The majority of patients who now present with milk-alkali syndrome are women, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-carbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium carbonate</a> is the predominant source of calcium and alkali intake.

There was also severe metabolic alkalosis, a normal to elevated plasma phosphate concentration, and acute kidney injury. Withdrawal of milk and alkali led to rapid relief of symptoms and the return of normal renal function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic &ndash; In the chronic form (also called Burnett's syndrome), patients presented after a long history of high <span class=\"nowrap\">milk/alkali</span> intake with symptoms of chronic hypercalcemia, such as polyuria, polydipsia, muscle aches, and pruritus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-milk-alkali-syndrome/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. Frequently, there was evidence of metastatic calcifications, including band keratopathy and nephrocalcinosis. Laboratory abnormalities were similar to those in the acute syndrome, but the response to withdrawal of milk and alkali was quite different. The muscle aches and pruritus improved slowly as the plasma calcium concentration slowly normalized.

A thorough history is critical in identifying potential extrinsic sources of calcium or the use of vitamin D preparations that may increase intestinal calcium absorption. The diagnostic approach to hypercalcemia is presented elsewhere.

This may be because, with other etiologies of hypercalcemia (eg, primary hyperparathyroidism or malignancy), the stimulus to calcium retention persists even after acute treatment of the hypercalcemia. By contrast, in milk-alkali syndrome, cessation of calcium and alkali ingestion immediately removes the hypercalcemic stimulus while suppressed PTH levels are slower to respond. For the same reason, bisphosphonates, which cause a prolonged suppression of the serum calcium, can produce hypocalcemia in patients with the milk-alkali syndrome and should be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-milk-alkali-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4158473743\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

The combined effects of increased alkali intake, decreased GFR, and volume depletion lead to metabolic alkalosis.

The syndrome can also be seen in patients taking calcium-containing over-the-counter antacid medications, and in patients with chronic kidney disease who are prescribed calcium carbonate to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism. Historically, patients presented with symptoms of acute or chronic hypercalcemia (eg, nausea, vomiting, weakness, altered sensorium, and pruritus) and, depending upon the duration of hypercalcemia, renal impairment that did not always resolve after normalization of the plasma calcium.
