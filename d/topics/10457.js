There is a wide range of clinical severity associated with MFS. Although many clinicians view the disorder in terms of classic ocular, cardiovascular, and musculoskeletal abnormalities, these patients also demonstrate significant involvement of the lung, skin, and central nervous system. </p><p>The management and prognosis of MFS and related disorders will be reviewed here. The genetics, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of MFS and related disorders and issues related to MFS in pregnancy are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis of Marfan syndrome and related disorders&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-and-marfan-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy and Marfan syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prognosis of patients with MFS has improved with the use of beta blockers, restriction of vigorous physical exercise, routine and noninvasive monitoring of aortic size, and elective surgical repair of the aorta. The physiologic changes that occur during pregnancy are associated with an increased risk of aortic dilation and dissection and therefore require more intensive monitoring. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-and-marfan-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy and Marfan syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The 2010 American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/American</span> Association for Thoracic Surgery <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC/AHA/AATS)</span> guidelines for thoracic aortic disease include recommendations for MFS, Loeys-Dietz Syndrome and other genetic syndromes affecting the aorta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These guidelines are similar to the recommendations for MFS published in 2001 by a Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">AORTIC MONITORING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Monitoring of the aortic diameter is recommended to identify patients at high risk for aortic dissection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">How to measure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The aortic diameter measurement technique applied to follow a given patient should be noted and used consistently during serial follow-up with nomograms specific for that technique applied when determining deviation from the appropriate age- and size-matched normal population (generally expressed as a Z-score, which designates number of standard deviations from the mean). Since normal aortic dimensions vary with age and body surface area, these parameters should be taken into account (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F97882%7ESURG%2F97883\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97882 graphicRef97883 \">figure 1A-B</a>). Measurement conventions for aortic diameter differ for echocardiography as compared to computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the measurement convention may also differ within modalities from one institution to another. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Indications in MFS'</a> below.) </p><p>Multiple conventions are applied when measuring the maximal dimension of the aortic root by echocardiography. Examples include the leading-edge-to-leading-edge technique in diastole (a common practice among adult cardiologists) or the inner-edge-to-inner-edge technique in systole (a common practice among pediatric cardiologists). Similar variability can be observed when applying CT or MRI measurements, depending upon whether or not contrast agents are utilized. In general, the external diameter is expected to be 2 to 4 mm larger than the internal diameter. There is also variation in practice with regard to whether the external or internal diameter is operative when considering thresholds for surgical repair. </p><p>For MFS, aortic diameter at the sinuses of Valsalva is the key measurement since this is the segment that generally dilates initially and is at greatest risk for aortic dissection. This measurement can usually be monitored by echocardiography. Greater length of aortic dilation (ie, to the aortic arch versus limited to the sinuses of Valsalva) can be associated with a worse prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring MFS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As recommended in the 2010 <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA/AATS</span> guidelines for thoracic aortic disease, patients with MFS should have echocardiography performed at the time of diagnosis and six months later to determine the aortic root and ascending aortic diameters and their rate of enlargement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>We suggest performing cross-sectional aortic imaging with CT or MRI at the time of initial evaluation to confirm that the aorta measurements determined by echocardiography are not underestimated, and also to identify aortic or vascular disease that is not appreciated by echocardiography. When ascending aorta dimensions measured by echocardiography and cross-sectional imaging correlate with each other and no additional aortic disease is identified, cross-sectional imaging is repeated every three to five years and prior to elective operation. This frequency should be increased if there is a family history of disease in the descending thoracic or abdominal aorta in association with MFS. &#160;</p><p>In adults, if the aortic diameter is documented as stable over time, then annual imaging is recommended if the aortic dimension is less than 45 mm. If the aortic diameter is &ge;45 mm or shows significant growth over time, then more frequent imaging is suggested (eg, twice yearly) and surgery may be indicated. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Indications in MFS'</a> below.) More frequent imaging is also recommended if the aortic diameter shows rapid change (&ge;0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/year)</span> or if there are concerns regarding heart or valve function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>For children with MFS, annual imaging is recommended if the aortic dimension is documented as stable over time and not markedly enlarged. There are no validated age-specific absolute aortic diameters that can be used to determine when more frequent imaging should be performed or when prophylactic aortic surgery is indicated. It is recommended that aortic measurements be compared to the body surface area. Sonographic measurement of aortic diameter should be performed annually as long as the increase in aortic size remains proportional to the increase in body surface area. Twice-yearly measurements are recommended if aortic size (expressed as a percentage increase) diverges from the height when expressed in the same fashion.</p><p>Individuals under 20 years of age with systemic findings suggestive of MFS, but without cardiovascular involvement, should also have annual echocardiograms due to the potential risk of development of aortic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Adults with repeatedly normal and stable aortic measurements without a definitive genetic predisposition for aortic enlargement but with a sense of predisposition based upon family history or borderline aortic measurements can be seen at two- to three-year intervals. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring Loeys-Dietz and related syndromes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As recommended in the 2010 <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA/AATS</span> guidelines, complete aortic imaging should be performed at the time of diagnosis and 6 months after in patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome or a confirmed genetic mutation associated with aortic aneurysms and aortic dissections (eg, TGFBR1, TGFBR2, SMAD3, TGFB2, FBN1, ACTA2, or MYH11) to determine if aortic enlargement is occurring.</p><p>If the aortic dimension is stable and no other specific problem in another vascular segment has been identified, patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome (potentially caused by mutations in TGFBR1, TGFBR2, SMAD3, TGFB2, or TGFB3) should have serial MRI from the cerebrovascular circulation to the pelvis (with a maximal interval between studies of two years) since they commonly develop aneurysms that are amenable to prophylactic surgical management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DRUG THERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Beta blocker</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Beta blocker recommendations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted in the 2010 American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/American</span> Association for Thoracic Surgery <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC/AHA/AATS)</span> thoracic aorta guidelines, we recommend beta blocker therapy for adults with Marfan syndrome (MFS) and aortic aneurysm to reduce the rate of aortic dilatation unless contraindicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. We also suggest beta blocker therapy for children with MFS and aortic aneurysm, though data in children are inconclusive. Use of medication is commonly considered in individuals documented to be at risk with demonstrated aortic root enlargement, a family history of aortic root enlargement, or a mutation previously demonstrated to associate with aortic disease. The dose should be adjusted to maintain the heart rate after submaximal exercise (eg, running up and down two flights of stairs) &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/minute</span> in adults and &lt;110 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/minute</span> in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> was the first beta blocker demonstrated to slow aortic dilation, other beta blockers may be used as well. Use of longer-acting agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a>, with daily dosing may improve compliance. Among pregnant women, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=labetalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">labetalol</a> or metoprolol are the preferred beta blockers since atenolol may impair fetal growth. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-and-marfan-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy and Marfan syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A randomized trial is needed to determine the efficacy of beta blockers in children with MFS. In the absence of such data, we suggest a beta blocker be given to all children with MFS.

Prophylactic treatment with beta blockers has been considered the standard of care in adults since the mid-1990s, when the results of an open-label, randomized trial of 70 adults with classic MFS were published; the patients were assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> or no specific treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

The 20 patients who were taking a beta blocker and the six patients taking a calcium channel blocker had a slower absolute aortic growth rate (0.9 versus 1.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/year</span> in untreated patients) and aortic growth rate adjusted for age and body size. Protection was not complete since 5 of the 26 treated patients had a major cardiovascular complication requiring surgery over a four-year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective study of 63 children was conducted at two sites in which beta blocker therapy versus no therapy was assigned according to local practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. There was no difference in the rate of change in aortic root measurements between the two groups at the end of the study.

The 2010 <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA/AATS</span> guidelines include a recommendation that an ARB (losartan) is reasonable in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Beta blocker'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest addition of an angiotensin receptor blocker to beta blocker therapy in patients with MFS with aortic aneurysm as tolerated (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Therapy targeting the renin-angiotensin system'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with MFS, elective aortic repair is associated with reduced mortality when compared to urgent or emergent repair. Elective surgical intervention should be considered when an adult has an aortic root diameter of &ge;50 mm and a child has a disproportionately rapid increase in aortic diameter when compared to the rate of increase in body surface area even if the diameter is &le;50 mm. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Indications in MFS'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For adult patients with Loeys-Dietz syndrome or a confirmed TGFBR1 or TGFBR2 mutation and an aortic diameter of &ge;4.2 cm by echocardiogram (internal diameter) or &ge;4.4 to 4.6 cm by computed tomographic imaging <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> magnetic resonance imaging (external diameter) it is reasonable to consider elective surgical repair of the aorta. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Indications in Loeys-Dietz syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For young children with prominent craniofacial features of Loeys-Dietz syndrome, prophylactic surgery is indicated if the aortic valve annulus is at least 18 to 20 mm and the aortic diameter exceeds the 99th percentile for age. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Indications in Loeys-Dietz syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients undergoing aortic root replacement, composite aortic root and valve replacement and valve-sparing surgical techniques are considerations, and the choice of operation is dependent upon patient specific considerations.
