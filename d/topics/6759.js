In addition, evaluation can be frustrating and difficult because the etiology of their RPL may not be determined and there are few evidence-based diagnostic and treatment strategies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

The various definitions and rationale behind them is discussed in detail separately. &#160;(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-etiology-of-recurrent-pregnancy-loss\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and etiology of recurrent pregnancy loss&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is a general consensus that healthy women should not undergo extensive evaluation after a single first trimester or early second trimester spontaneous miscarriage (up to 20 weeks), given these are relatively common, sporadic events: miscarriage occurs in about 10 to 15 percent of clinically recognized pregnancies under 20 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In prospective studies, the overall risk of miscarriage in the next pregnancy remains about 15 percent after one miscarriage, but rises to 17 to 31 percent after two consecutive miscarriages and to 25 to 46 percent after three or more miscarriages. Based on these and similar data, most experts initiate evaluation and treatment of RPL after two consecutive miscarriages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].</p><p>It is important to remember that most women with RPL have a good prognosis for eventually having a successful pregnancy, even when a definitive diagnosis is not made and no treatment initiated. In one representative study, the overall live birth rates after normal and abnormal diagnostic evaluations for RPL were 77 and 71 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In another study, 8 of 17 women with six or more consecutive unexplained miscarriages subsequently achieved a successful pregnancy outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY AND PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The minimum diagnostic workup of couples with RPL consists of a complete medical, surgical, genetic, and family history and a physical examination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history should include a description of the gestational age and characteristics (eg, anembryonic pregnancy, live embryo) of all previous pregnancies. Gestational age is important because RPL typically occurs at a similar gestational age in consecutive pregnancies and the most common causes of RPL vary by trimester. As an example, miscarriage related to chromosomal and endocrine defects tends to occur earlier in gestation than losses due to anatomic or immunological abnormalities; however, there is significant overlap.</p><p>Additional information to consider:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has there been uterine instrumentation, which may have caused intrauterine adhesions?

One study of 301 women with RPL reported fourfold higher rates of depression (8.6 versus 2 percent) and doubling of severe stress (41 versus 23 percent) for the women with versus without RPL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This study highlights the importance of mental health evaluation, including screening for depression, as part of the RPL work-up. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-depression-in-adults#H22016477\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for depression in adults&quot;, section on 'Screening options'</a>.) &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Most useful tests</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Karyotype</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Karyotyping of couples is part of the evaluation of RPL, despite the low yield of abnormality, cost, and limited prognostic value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/7,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,12,13</a>]. The purpose is to detect balanced reciprocal or Robertsonian translocations or mosaicism that could be passed to the fetus unbalanced.</p><p>Because of the low likelihood of an abnormal karyotype in couples with RPL, this is the last test we obtain and only if the preceding work-up yielded negative results. A review of cytogenetic findings in 79 published surveys of couples with two or more pregnancy losses (n = 8208 women and 7834 men) observed the overall prevalence of major chromosome abnormalities was 2.9 percent, which is five to six times higher than that of the general adult population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Approximately one-half of the abnormalities were balanced reciprocal translocations, one-quarter were Robertsonian translocations, and one-tenth were sex chromosome mosaicisms in females; the rest consisted of inversions and other sporadic abnormalities. A large database subsequently reported similar findings: 4.7 percent of couples with two or more spontaneous abortions included one carrier of a structural chromosomal abnormality, usually a translocation or inversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Chromosomal abnormalities detectable in parental peripheral blood preparations are an indirect and limited indicator of fetal karyotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Therefore, many experts also recommend karyotype of the abortus or products of conception. A normal karyotype suggests (but does not prove) a maternal environmental factor is the cause of pregnancy loss, while an abnormal karyotype (aneuploidy) is usually a sufficient explanation for a nonviable pregnancy. In some cases, karyotype analysis of the abortus indicates a normal chromosomal pattern, but more detailed array comparative genomic hybridization demonstrates major abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Structural chromosomal rearrangements in the abortus may be inherited or sporadic, and are an indication for parental karyotype analysis if not already done.</p><p>If the abortus specimen does not grow in culture, a conventional karyotype cannot be determined. Cells from chromosomally abnormal abortuses, especially trisomy 7 and triploidies, are less likely to grow in culture, thereby skewing the results of cohort studies of the frequency of aneuploidy in products of conception from spontaneously aborted pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Array comparative genomic hybridization does not require dividing cells, and therefore can be useful in fetal demise with culture failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Uterine assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anatomic causes of RPL are typically diagnosed using hysterosalpingography (HSG) or sonohysterography. We prefer the latter because it is more accurate than HSG and gives more information than sonography alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Hysteroscopy, laparoscopy, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can also be performed, as needed, but are more expensive and (except for MRI) more invasive than sonohysterography. Therefore, they are used as second-line tests when additional information is required to determine a diagnosis. Ultrasonography is particularly useful in pregnant women, in whom the other tests are relatively or absolutely contraindicated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-uterus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of congenital anomalies of the uterus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sonohysterography</strong> &ndash; Sonohysterography delineates the internal contours of the uterine cavity and provides concomitant sonographic visualization of the outer surface and wall of the uterus. It provides information on tubal patency and can distinguish between the septate and bicornuate uterus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In comparative studies, sonohysterography was more accurate than HSG and provided more information about uterine abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].

It provides more information about tubal anatomy and patency; however, it does not evaluate the outer contour of the uterus, therefore it cannot reliably differentiate between a septate and a bicornuate uterus unless a laparoscopy to view the uterine fundus is also performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].

In addition, treatment of many intrauterine lesions can be performed during the procedure. However, it also cannot reliably differentiate between a septate and a bicornuate uterus unless a laparoscopy to view the uterine fundus is also performed. Because of its cost and invasiveness, hysteroscopic uterine assessment is usually reserved for patients who have had a nondiagnostic evaluation of RPL or those in whom intrauterine pathology is suspected and operative hysteroscopy may be necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hysteroscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hysteroscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ultrasound</strong> &ndash; Transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) and transabdominal ultrasound are useful for making the diagnosis of a septate uterus and renal abnormalities, and provide information about the presence and location of uterine myomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/24,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,27</a>]. TVS also provides information about the presence and location of uterine myomas and, in pregnancy, the possibility of cervical insufficiency and assessment of fetal viability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. <br/><br/>Three-dimensional ultrasound, where available, is accurate in diagnosing uterine anomalies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In contrast to two-dimensional ultrasound, but similar to magnetic resonance imaging, it allows visualization of both the uterine cavity and the external contour of the uterus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Magnetic resonance imaging</strong> &ndash; MRI is useful for distinguishing between a septate and bicornuate uterus suspected on ultrasonography or HSG. It is less invasive and less costly than laparoscopy for this purpose. As an example, a study of 26 women comparing MRI (n = 26), TVS (n = 14), and HSG (n = 20) for classification of m&uuml;llerian duct anomalies reported that MRI diagnosed 24 of 24 cases correctly, TVS was correct in 11 of 12 cases, and HSG was correct in only four cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. For diagnosis of septate uterus, MRI performed better than two-dimensional TVS (sensitivity and specificity of 100 percent for MRI versus 100 and 80 percent, respectively, for TVS). Three-dimensional ultrasound is also reliable, but simpler than MRI for distinguishing septate from bicornuate uteri. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Anticardiolipin antibodies and lupus anticoagulant</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The minimum immunology work-up for women with RPL is measurement of anticardiolipin antibody (IgG and IgM) and lupus anticoagulant. Both tests should be done twice, six to eight weeks apart, because a low to mid positive level can be due to viral illness and revert to normal. The anticardiolipin antibody titer is considered elevated if medium or high titers of both IgG and IgM isotypes are present in blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The detection of the lupus anticoagulant is generally based upon an activated partial thromboplastin time, kaolin plasma clotting time, or dilute Russell viper venom test time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Thyroid function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thyroid function should be assessed in women with clinical manifestations or a personal history of thyroid disease. Screening asymptomatic women for subclinical thyroid dysfunction is controversial.

In addition, meta-analysis of two randomized trials of the effect of thyroid replacement in these women found treatment was associated with a significant reduction in risk of miscarriage (relative risk 0.48, 95% CI 0.25-0.92) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]; however, there were methodological limitations to these trials.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials.

These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic.
