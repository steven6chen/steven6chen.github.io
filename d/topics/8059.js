As an example, in one early series of patients with AIDS, anemia was noted in approximately 70 percent, lymphopenia in 70 percent, neutropenia in 50 percent, and thrombocytopenia in 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-anemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The incidence of the various cytopenias correlates directly with the degree of immunosuppression. However, isolated abnormalities, particularly thrombocytopenia, may be encountered as the initial presentation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. As a result, HIV infection should be considered in the assessment of patients presenting with any type of cytopenia.</p><p>The causes and treatment of anemia in patients with HIV infection will be reviewed here. Similar issues regarding neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, coagulation defects, and lymphopenia are discussed separately.

While anemia may manifest as a mere laboratory abnormality in some individuals, others may experience typical symptoms (eg, fatigue, dyspnea, reduced exercise tolerance, diminished functional capacity) directly related to a reduction in hemoglobin concentration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-anemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with anemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In a review of more than 32,000 patients infected with HIV, the yearly incidence of developing anemia increased with disease progression, affecting 3 percent of all patients with asymptomatic HIV infection, 12 percent of asymptomatic patients with CD4 cell counts <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;200/microL,</span> and 37 percent of patients with an AIDS-related illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-anemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The prevalence of anemia among patients with HIV directly correlates overall HIV-associated symptomatology. In one study of more than 300 HIV infected patients, the prevalence of anemia among patients in the first, second, third, and fourth quartiles of HIV-associated symptom burden was 45, 49, 60, and 70 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-anemia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for the development of anemia were evaluated in a report from The Women's Interagency HIV study (WIHS), which evaluated 2056 HIV-1 infected women between October 1994 and September 1998 for the development of anemia (ie, Hgb &lt;12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-anemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

In the above review of 32,000 patients seen prior to the advent of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART), anemia was significantly associated with an increased risk of death when patients were stratified by CD4 cell counts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-anemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Furthermore, mortality rates fell in those who recovered from the anemia to a level comparable to patients who were not anemic; this effect was independent of the CD4 cell count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-anemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In another study involving more than 1000 HIV-infected Tanzanian women, anemia was associated with increased AIDS-related and all-cause mortality, independent of baseline CD4 count, World Health Organization clinical stage, patient age, and body mass index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-anemia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Despite the advent of potent ART, HIV-related anemia is still common, and independently associated with decreased survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-anemia/abstract/4,7,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7,10,11</a>]. In a European study of 6725 HIV-infected patients with a one year follow-up, the incidence of mild (hemoglobin 8 to 14 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> in men and 8 to 12 in women) and severe (hemoglobin &lt;8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> anemia was 58 and 1.4 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-anemia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The death rate at one year for this cohort was 3, 16, and 41 percent for those who had no, mild, or severe anemia, respectively.</p><p>Similar findings were noted in the WIHS study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-anemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Anemia was independently associated with decreased survival (hazard ratio 2.6, 95% CI 1.9-3.4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-anemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Effect of ART'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, the cause of anemia in HIV-infected patients is <strong>multifactorial</strong>, reflecting the associated and often additive effects of infection, inflammation, malignancy, malnutrition, and polypharmacy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F65608\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65608 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-anemia/abstract/2,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12</a>]. The finding of a low hematocrit or hemoglobin concentration warrants careful evaluation for treatable underlying illnesses, including a complete blood count with red cell indices and reticulocyte count, serum bilirubin and vitamin B12, red cell folate levels, iron studies, peripheral blood smear and, in cases of refractory or unexplained anemia, serum erythropoietin and bone marrow sampling. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-anemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with anemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Opportunistic processes must be carefully excluded during the evaluation of anemia. Although many infections may be associated with cytopenias in HIV-infected patients, several are characteristically linked to abnormalities of red blood cell production. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-prevention-of-opportunistic-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of prevention of opportunistic infections in HIV-infected patients&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology of opportunistic infections'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Mycobacteria, fungi, and parasites</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mycobacteria and fungi are capable of broad dissemination throughout the bone marrow, eventually replacing the normal architecture and inhibiting the maturation of progenitor cells. Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC), M. tuberculosis, and Histoplasma capsulatum are the most common offenders. In more rare cases, other agents such as Pneumocystis carinii, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Penicillium marneffei have caused pancytopenia through bone marrow infiltration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-anemia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Malaria, visceral leishmaniasis, and intestinal parasites are other causes of significant anemia among HIV patients living in endemic areas or following travel to these areas.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Viral infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Viral infections may be associated with suppression of normal bone marrow function. Mild-to-moderate anemia is a common finding in patients with acute cytomegalovirus (CMV) or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection in addition to HIV.</p><p>Parvovirus B19 is a small, single-stranded DNA virus capable of infecting and lysing early erythroid precursors. In the normal host, the immune response controls the infection in 10 days to two weeks, red cell production returns, and there is no clinically apparent anemia. However, a potentially life-threatening anemia can occur in immunodeficient patients due to an inability to control the virus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-parvovirus-b19-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of parvovirus B19 infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although parvovirus B19 has been linked to the development of chronic and often severe anemia in patients with HIV infection, persistent viremia with parvovirus appears to be a rare occurrence. In one study, for example, sera from 317 consecutive HIV-positive patients were evaluated, 55 percent of whom were anemic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-anemia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Over 60 percent had detectable IgG reacting to parvovirus B19, but none had detectable viral DNA by polymerase chain reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-anemia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>However, the likelihood of parvovirus B19 viremia is increased when only patients with severe anemia are analyzed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-anemia/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. In one series, PCR analysis for parvoviral DNA was positive in 17 and 31 percent of HIV-infected patients with hematocrits &le;24 and &le;20 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-anemia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Malignancy and lymphoproliferative disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infiltration of the bone marrow by malignant cells is a potential cause of anemia and other cytopenias. The small noncleaved cell type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is the most common offender (Burkitt-like), followed by other aggressive and highly aggressive malignant lymphomas and, rarely, Kaposi's sarcoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aids-related-lymphomas-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-systemic-lymphoma#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;AIDS-related lymphomas: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of systemic lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with HIV infection are also at increased risk of developing multicentric Castleman's disease, a Human Herpesvirus 8-associated (HHV-8) condition commonly presenting with anemia, fever and lymphadenopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-anemia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

As an example, studies have noted reduced serum vitamin B12 concentrations in more than 10 percent of outpatients with HIV infection and as many as 20 percent of patients with AIDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-anemia/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. In a 2016 study of 270 HIV-infected individuals from nine countries (including the United States) who had not been treated with antiretroviral therapy, the prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency was 9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-anemia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. While lower B12-deficiency prevalence rates of 2 percent have been documented in other series, most studies suggest a higher risk of low vitamin B12 levels among patients with lower baseline CD4 counts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-anemia/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p>The etiology of vitamin B12 deficiency in these patients has been linked to malabsorption in the distal ileum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-anemia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], achlorhydria with a secondary reduction in intrinsic factor production, and an alteration in cobalamin transport proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-anemia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In HIV-infected individuals, vitamin B12 deficiency is uncommonly associated with megaloblastic changes in the bone marrow or the neurologic sequelae characteristically encountered in the non-HIV population. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiencies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-pathophysiology-of-vitamin-b12-and-folate-deficiencies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and pathophysiology of vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Assessment of B12 levels in HIV-infected individuals is similar to non-HIV-infected populations, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unexplained anemia, macrocytosis (mean corpuscular volume [MCV] &gt;100 fL), pancytopenia, or hypersegmented neutrophils</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unexplained neurologic or psychiatric symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Associated conditions such as bariatric surgery, malnutrition, or strict vegan diet without appropriate supplementation</p><p/><p>Folate deficiency can occur in HIV-infected patients and may result from reductions in both dietary intake and intestinal absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-anemia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Folate deficiency should be considered in patients at high risk for reduced dietary intake and those with an elevated mean corpuscular volume or megaloblastic changes on blood smear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F58820\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58820 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypogonadism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypogonadism is frequently reported among patients with advanced HIV infection. In one cross-sectional observational assessment of 200 HIV-infected patients, anemia (ie, hemoglobin &lt;13.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> in men and &lt;11.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> in women) was associated with low testosterone levels (adjusted OR 3.23, 95% CI 1.01-10.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-anemia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In addition, the presence of anemia was negatively correlated with the usage of androgen medications (adjusted OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05-0.84).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Abnormal iron metabolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Iron studies are typically consistent with the anemia of inflammation (anemia of chronic disease), characterized by reduced concentrations of serum iron and total iron binding capacity and a normal or increased concentration of serum ferritin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-anemia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anemia-of-chronic-disease-inflammation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anemia of chronic disease/inflammation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In some cases, however, there is evidence of iron deficiency anemia, typically related to gastrointestinal blood loss. Potential causes include intestinal Kaposi's sarcoma, gastrointestinal ulceration, gastritis, and intestinal infections with various viral (especially CMV), bacterial, and parasitic agents.

In one study, a positive direct antiglobulin test (Coombs test) was encountered in 18 percent of patients with AIDS, compared with less than 1 percent of non-infected blood donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-anemia/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Despite this finding, clinically evident hemolysis was not noted in any of the 55 HIV-infected patients.</p><p>The most common antibodies are directed against U and i antigens on the red blood cell surface. In one series of 28 hospitalized patients with AIDS, 43 percent had a positive direct Coombs test, and 64 and 32 percent tested positive for anti-i and anti-U, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-anemia/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. This laboratory anomaly has been ascribed to the generalized hypergammaglobulinemia seen in HIV infection, although it is possible that anti-i reactivity resulted from active EBV or CMV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-anemia/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p>Although uncommon, typical warm antibody autoimmune hemolytic anemia has been described in patients with HIV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematologic-manifestations-of-hiv-infection-anemia/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].
