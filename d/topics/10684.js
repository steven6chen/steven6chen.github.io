The choice of method depends on which of these compartments is of interest, whether the measurement is for clinical purposes or research, and what degree of precision is required.</p><p>The main methods used to estimate body composition are discussed here. Measurements of growth in children and disorders of under- or over-nutrition are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-growth-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of growth in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-epidemiology-and-etiology-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition; epidemiology; and etiology of obesity in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=failure-to-thrive-undernutrition-in-children-younger-than-two-years-etiology-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Failure to thrive (undernutrition) in children younger than two years: Etiology and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20721754\"><span class=\"h1\">THEORETICAL MODELS OF BODY COMPOSITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Theoretical models of body composition divide the body into two, three, or multiple compartments: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the two-compartment model, the body is divided into the fat and fat-free mass. Bioimpedance is a method used to assess body composition based on the two-compartment model. The two-compartment model is useful in clinical practice because of the ease with which body fat and fat-free mass can be measured and the simplicity with which their changes during health and disease can be assessed. However, the two-compartment model is subject to error because the methods used to measure body fat and fat-free mass are based upon the assumption that the chemical composition of these tissue stores remains constant across a broad range of ages and disease states. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the three-compartment model, the body is divided into fat, fat-free mass, and bone. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) is a method to assess body composition based on the three compartment model. The body composition of children from birth to 16 years of age has been measured using this method (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70879\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70879 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Fat-free mass and body fat increase with age throughout childhood, but vary at any given age depending on gender and race or ethnicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. These estimates provide reference values for healthy children and useful comparative indices to assess nutritional deficits in children who are ill [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multicompartment models reduce the errors inherent in the two-compartment model by dividing the body into components based on its atomic, molecular, cellular, or tissue composition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F79699\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79699 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Although these models describe body composition more precisely, the techniques required to measure these components are limited to research settings. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ESTIMATES OF ADIPOSITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Numerous measures are used for clinical assessment of obesity in children and adolescents and include body mass index (BMI), weight-for-height, skinfold thickness, and waist circumference or waist-to-hip ratio. BMI is the standard measure of obesity for children older than two years; waist circumference and waist-hip ratio are used primarily for research purposes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-epidemiology-and-etiology-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition; epidemiology; and etiology of obesity in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Body mass index</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The body mass index (BMI) is the most practical way to evaluate the degree of excess weight and risk for metabolic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. It correlates with body fat and is relatively unaffected by height. It is calculated from the weight and square of the height and can be determined using a calculator for boys (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-body-mass-index-bmi-percentiles-for-boys-2-to-20-years\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) and for girls (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-body-mass-index-bmi-percentiles-for-girls-2-to-20-years\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>). In children, BMI varies with age and gender (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60784%7EPEDS%2F68478\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60784 graphicRef68478 \">figure 2A-B</a>). It also varies to a lesser extent with pubertal maturation stage and ethnicity, and these factors should be taken into account when BMI measures are used for research [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-growth-in-children#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of growth in children&quot;, section on 'Body mass index (BMI)'</a>.) and (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-epidemiology-and-etiology-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition; epidemiology; and etiology of obesity in children and adolescents&quot;</a>).</p><p>BMI is a good predictor of adiposity in the healthy pediatric population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/8,11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11-13</a>]. As an example, BMI was compared with percentage of fat obtained by using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in a study of 979 children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The standard error for an individual BMI measurement compared to percentage fat was 4.7 to 7.3 percent of body weight. However, BMI is not a direct measure of adiposity, and may slightly overestimate fatness in children who are short or who have relatively high muscle mass. BMI also may underestimate adiposity in a substantial proportion of children, such as those with reduced muscle mass due to low levels of physical activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Finally, children of different stature but the same BMI do not necessarily have the same body composition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Weight-for-height</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Weight-for-height measurements are another means to assess adiposity, and are the preferred method for clinical assessment of obesity or failure to thrive in children younger than two years old. In older children, overweight, simple obesity, and severe obesity are sometimes defined as weight-for-height measurements greater than 110, 120, and 140 percent of expected, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Expected body weight is determined from the weight percentile that is proportionate to the height percentile for chronologic age using standard growth curves (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73036%7EPEDS%2F53474\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73036 graphicRef53474 \">figure 3A-B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F55850%7EPEDS%2F65129\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55850 graphicRef65129 \">figure 4A-B</a>). </p><p>For children older than two years, BMI has replaced weight-for-height estimates as the standard measure for adiposity because weight-for-height measurements do not correlate well with body fat and are affected by height to a greater degree. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Body mass index'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">FAT DISTRIBUTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adults with abdominal adiposity (also called central, visceral, android, or male-type obesity) are at increased risk for heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, and some forms of cancer. The evidence for this association in children and adolescents is weaker. However, data from the Bogalusa Heart Study generated age-specific thresholds for body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference in children and adolescents that were predictive of having three or more risk factors for cardiovascular disease (high blood pressure; low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration; or high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, glucose, or insulin concentration, adjusted for age) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51934%7EPEDS%2F59701\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51934 graphicRef59701 \">figure 5A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Abdominal obesity is evaluated clinically by measuring the waist circumference or the ratio of waist circumference to the hip circumference (waist-to-hip ratio, or WHR). Waist circumference is measured just above the uppermost lateral border of the right ilium, at the end of a normal expiration. The hip circumference is measured in a horizontal plane at the level of maximum circumference of the hips and buttocks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Waist-to-hip ratio</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Men with a WHR of 0.95 or more and women with a WHR of 0.85 or more are considered to be at increased cardiovascular risk. Similar definitions have not been developed for children, although they, too, are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease if they have abdominal adiposity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/18-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-25</a>]. One study of 127 children and adolescents aged 9 to 17 years, as an example, found correlations between abdominal fat distribution and triglycerides, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, and left ventricular mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Waist circumference</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Waist circumference percentile curves have been developed for Canadian [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], British [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], Italian [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], Spanish [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], and Australian children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) were used to estimate age-, sex- and ethnicity-specific waist circumference percentiles for children and adolescents in the United States (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80082\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80082 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>The waist circumference values at different percentiles describe the existing population of children and adolescents and do not establish a standard of what &quot;should be.&quot; Some, but not all, definitions of the metabolic syndrome in children include waist circumference (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F66120\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66120 \">table 3</a>), and these features do not track consistently to metabolic syndrome in adulthood. Nonetheless, this measurement, in conjunction with the BMI, may serve as a useful clinical tool to estimate obesity-related comorbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/25,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,32</a>].

Analysis of data from NHANES III indicates that the waist-to-height ratio may be a better predictor of increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, and fasting triglycerides than BMI in children aged 4 to 17 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) can be used to measure visceral adipose tissue. The technique usually quantifies adipose tissue in a single-slice cross-section at the level of the <span class=\"nowrap\">L4/L5</span> lumbar disc. The subcutaneous fat (outside the abdominal musculature) may be measured in the same image. These measures of visceral adiposity correlate with insulin resistance, triglycerides, hepatic steatosis, and other components of the metabolic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. The technique is used for research in obesity and metabolic disease, and does not contribute to clinical care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">MEASURES OF BODY COMPOSITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measurement of body composition, particularly body fat, can be an important part of nutritional assessment because fat is the major source of stored energy in the body and a good indicator of nutritional state. In addition, lean body mass indicates the water and protein content, and bone density indicates the calcium and mineral stores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The methods used to measure body composition differ in their ease of determination, cost, accuracy, use of radiation, and utility for estimating body fat (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F51556\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51556 \">table 4</a>) or other body compartments relevant to nutritional status (eg, bone density). The most commonly used techniques are described below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Anthropometrics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most widely used anthropometric measurements to assess body composition are the triceps skinfold and the mid-upper arm circumference. The triceps skinfold reflects body fat and the mid-upper arm cross-sectional area reflects lean body mass. Because the precision and reproducibility of these measures is low, they add little to the clinical evaluation for most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. For the same reason, most research studies seeking a measure of body composition will use one of the more precise measures discussed below when possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Skinfold thickness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measurements of multiple skinfold thicknesses are used widely because the technique is noninvasive, inexpensive, and easy to perform. However, measurements of skinfold thickness often are less accurate than are measurements of height or weight, particularly in obese subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. One study compared the agreement between eight widely used skinfold thickness equations and the value obtained on the basis of measurements of body density, body water, and bone mineral content [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The use of skinfold measurement calculations over- or underestimated individual fat mass by approximately 10 percent. A review of the literature substantiates these concerns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Although skinfold thickness measurements may have limited clinical value, they may be useful in the long-term monitoring of nutritional therapy in children who are malnourished, have diseases that are associated with changes in body composition, or are obese [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p>The triceps skinfold is measured as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The child's arm should hang freely</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The upper arm skinfold (skin and fat minus the underlying muscle) should be pulled out 1 cm above midpoint</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The calipers should be applied 1 cm in depth at the measured midpoint</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The calipers should be released, and the reading should be obtained to the nearest 1 mm as soon as the needle is steady</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The average of duplicate measurements should be recorded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Mid-arm muscle circumference</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mid-upper arm circumference is measured as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The child's right arm should be flexed at a 90-degree angle and hang freely</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The midpoint between the tip of the olecranon and acromion should be marked</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The circumference of the arm should be measured to the nearest 0.1 cm at the midpoint with a flexible metal tape [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]</p><p/><p>The mid-arm muscle circumference (MAMC) can be calculated from the triceps skinfold (TSF) and the mid-arm circumference (MAC) as follows:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>MAMC = MAC &ndash; (3.1416 x TSF)</p></div></div><p>The measured values for TSF and MAC and the calculated MAMC are compared with reference values (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F67683%7EPEDS%2F78703%7EPEDS%2F72246\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67683 graphicRef78703 graphicRef72246 \">table 5A-C</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Values less than the 5th percentile for age are consistent with acute malnutrition, and values greater than the 90th percentile are consistent with obesity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Hydrodensitometry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Underwater weighing is the oldest method for determining body density; it has been largely replaced by dual energy absorptiometry (see below). Body density is estimated from the weight of the subject in air and water, using appropriate correction factors for temperature, air in the respiratory tract, and constants for the densities of fat and fat-free tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Hydrodensitometry can be performed only in children who can hold their breath for a period of time and have no contraindication to complete underwater submersion. In addition, the technique is not reliable in younger children because of the change in density of lean body mass during maturation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-puberty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal puberty&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Isotope dilution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In isotope dilution techniques, the volume of a body compartment is determined by the ratio of the dose of a tracer, administered orally or intravenously, to its concentration in the body compartment after a sufficient equilibration period has elapsed. Total body water, as an example, is estimated by isotope dilution using the stable isotopes of deuterium (2H<sub>2</sub>O) or oxygen (H<sub>2</sub><sup>18</sup>O) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Once total body water has been determined, the fat-free mass of the body can be calculated, based upon the assumption that the hydration of lean tissue is constant across a broad range of ages and for both genders. Potential errors can occur when hydrogen isotopes are used because they exchange with non-aqueous hydrogen resulting in overestimation of total body water by 5 to 10 percent. Isotope dilution is impractical in the clinical setting because of the expense of the stable isotopes and the analytical equipment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2528062011\"><span class=\"h2\">Bioelectrical impedance analysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) relies upon an electrical current to measure the fat and fat-free mass (FFM) of the body [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. The lean tissues of the body, because of their dissolved electrolytes, are the major conductors of electrical current, whereas body fat and bone are relatively poor conductors. Thus, BIA primarily measures total body water from which an estimate of FFM is obtained. BIA frequently is used because it is noninvasive, portable, and inexpensive. However, small changes in body water result in large differences in the estimate of FFM. Placement of the electrodes is site-specific and can compound errors of measurement. The placement of the electrodes (hand-to&ndash;foot, hand-to-foot, or foot-to-foot), will affect the capacity to predict body fat percentage. The foot-to-foot models (eg, Tanita SC-240) measure resistance in the lower part of the body, and has only fair precision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. The hand-to-foot models (eg, Biodynamics) measure resistance in both the lower and upper body [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. In addition, BIA is influenced by sex, age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>], disease state, and level of fatness (because total body water and relative extracellular water are greater in obese individuals) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. The data suggest BIA remains problematic in its ability to assess percent body fat, fat mass, or fat-free mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Air-displacement plethysmography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Air-displacement plethysmography is a method for determining body volume and hence, fat mass. Using the same whole-body measurement principle as underwater weighing, air-displacement plethysmography measures a subject's mass and volume, from which the whole-body density can be determined. The subject is placed inside the device; computerized pressure sensors then determine the amount of air displaced by the subject's body. Body fat and lean muscle mass can then be calculated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>The accuracy of air-displacement plethysmography (as compared with a gold standard of hydrostatic weighing or isotope dilution) is very good in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Compared with the four compartment model (fat, fat-free mass, total body water and bone), the accuracy and precision of air-displacement plethysmography are good in school-aged children (&plusmn; 2 percent for fat mass), providing that child-specific equations for lung volume are used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/58-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-60</a>]. The technique also has good accuracy in infants using a device specifically designed for this age group (eg, PeaPod) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/59,61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,61,62</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The above methods inform the two-compartment model of body composition. In contrast, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) estimates FFM, body fat, and bone mineral density by using the differential absorption of x-ray or photon beams of two levels of intensity. DXA relies on the principle that the intensity of an x-ray or photon beam is altered by the thickness, density, and chemical composition of an object in its path [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. In children, the scan takes approximately 10 minutes. The average radiation dose, depending on the instrument and body size, is 0.04 to 0.86 mRem, less than the average exposure of a chest radiograph [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. The precision of DXA (coefficient of variation) is less than 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. DXA has been used to measure body composition in children from birth to 16 years of age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70879\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70879 \">table 1</a>) and is becoming more readily available in the clinical setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The technique is limited because estimates of fat mass become less accurate as the individual's trunk thickness increases and it appears more accurate at a group level, compared with the individual level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/40,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,65</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-dual-energy-x-ray-absorptiometry#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry&quot;, section on 'Children'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Neutron activation analysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Body composition techniques, such as electrical impedance, tracer dilution, and DXA, provide information related to tissue density or volume but not chemical content. In contrast, neutron activation analysis allows the direct elemental analysis of the body. Virtually all the major elements of the body can be assayed in vivo: hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, calcium, phosphorus, sodium, chlorine, and potassium.</p><p>The method uses the principle that exposure to a given dose of neutrons generates a known amount of radioactivity within a given mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. When an atom captures a neutron, the atom is transformed to another nuclear state of the same chemical element. The new atom can be stable or radioactive, but it will have excess energy that must be released. If the new atom is radioactive, it will decay over time with a known half-life. Thus, when the body is exposed to neutrons, gamma rays are emitted immediately (prompt) and for some time thereafter (delayed); these gamma rays can be measured in a counting chamber. The particular element being examined can be identified by the characteristic energy of the electromagnetic radiation it emits and its rate of decay. The use of this technique is limited by its expense and radiation exposure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Total body potassium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Total body potassium counting, another method that determines elemental composition, measures the content of radioactive potassium (40K) in the body while the child lies between detectors in a well-shielded metal counting chamber [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/measurement-of-body-composition-in-children/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Radioactive potassium emits a characteristic high-energy gamma ray (1.46 MeV) that in turn serves as a marker for total body potassium, body cell mass, and fat-free mass. These relationships are based upon several assumptions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>40K exists in the body at a fixed proportion (0.0118 percent) to naturally occurring body potassium.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The total potassium content of the FFM remains constant with respect to tissue nitrogen, a major component of FFM.</p><p/><p>Although this method is noninvasive and safe, the limited availability of the instrument, particularly one with sufficient sensitivity to measure small infants, renders this method impractical in the clinical setting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The choice of method for measuring body composition depends on whether the measurement is for clinical purposes or research, and what degree of precision is required.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Body mass index (BMI) is the best determinant of adiposity for clinical purposes. It is sufficiently correlated with adiposity to provide a clinical estimate of weight-related medical risk, and it is noninvasive and inexpensive. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Body mass index'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Estimates of fat distribution, including waist-to-hip ratio and waist circumference, also are associated with weight-related medical risks in adults. The association is less clear for children and adolescents, and these measures are for the purposes of research rather than for their clinical utility. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Fat distribution'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Direct measures of body composition include anthropometrics, air-displacement plethysmography, and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). These measures vary considerably in their precision and expense; they generally are not valuable for the clinical evaluation of a patient. For the purposes of research studies requiring a precise measure of body composition, DXA or air-displacement plethysmography typically are used.
