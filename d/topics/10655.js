Because plasma volume increases more than red cell mass, the hematocrit generally falls, resulting in the physiologic &quot;anemia of pregnancy&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F62723\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62723 \">figure 1</a>).

Although the increase in cardiac output is initially due to a rise in stroke volume, the increase is maintained later in pregnancy by an increase in heart rate, as stroke volume falls during the third trimester. Decreases in systemic vascular resistance and pulmonary vascular resistance accompany the increase in cardiac output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-physiologic-respiratory-changes-and-dyspnea/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Blood pressure during pregnancy is often notable for a rise in pulse pressure due to an unchanged systolic pressure accompanied by a decrease in diastolic pressure.

The lower PCO<sub>2</sub> is thought to provide a diffusion gradient that may facilitate the fetus' ability to eliminate waste from aerobic metabolism.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Elevation of the diaphragm</strong> &ndash; In the first trimester, the subcostal angle can change from 68 to as much as 103 degrees [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-physiologic-respiratory-changes-and-dyspnea/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>], the diaphragm rises by up to 4 cm, and the chest diameter can increase 2 cm or more [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-physiologic-respiratory-changes-and-dyspnea/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Diaphragmatic excursion is not limited by the uterus, and actually increases by up to 2 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-physiologic-respiratory-changes-and-dyspnea/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. As the progressively enlarging uterus causes diaphragm position to rise up to 4 cm above its usual resting position, diaphragmatic excursion during respiration is not impaired. An additional contributing factor to diaphragm elevation is outward flaring of the ribs, which starts early in pregnancy before significant uterine enlargement. The change in chest wall configuration may be partly related to hormone-induced relaxation of ligamentous attachments to the lower ribs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-physiologic-respiratory-changes-and-dyspnea/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Decreased FRC and stable FEV1</strong> &ndash; Functional residual capacity (FRC) decreases approximately 20 percent during the latter half of pregnancy, due to a decrease in both expiratory reserve volume (ERV) and residual volume (RV) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80850\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80850 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-physiologic-respiratory-changes-and-dyspnea/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Variable and generally minor changes in vital capacity (VC) and total lung capacity (TLC) have also been observed, but the magnitude of these changes suggests they are not likely to be clinically significant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Airway function is preserved during pregnancy, as reflected by an unchanged forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and an unchanged <span class=\"nowrap\">FEV1/FVC</span> ratio. Minor changes, which are of little clinical importance, have been described in diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO): an increase during the first trimester followed by a decrease until 24 to 27 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-physiologic-respiratory-changes-and-dyspnea/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Interestingly, healthy women carrying twins appear to have similar respiratory function (mean FRC, FVC, VC, FEV1, PEFR, IC, ERV, minute ventilation, and pulmonary diffusing capacity) as women with singleton pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-physiologic-respiratory-changes-and-dyspnea/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Increased ventilation and respiratory drive</strong> &ndash; Perhaps the most striking change in respiratory physiology during pregnancy is an increase in resting minute ventilation, which rises by nearly 50 percent at term. This is primarily due to a larger tidal volume (increased up to 40 percent), whereas the respiratory rate remains essentially unchanged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-physiologic-respiratory-changes-and-dyspnea/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The increase in ventilation is greater than the corresponding elevation in oxygen consumption (approximately 20 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F59101\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59101 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-physiologic-respiratory-changes-and-dyspnea/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Increased levels of progesterone during pregnancy are thought to be responsible for the rise in ventilation above that explained by the enhanced metabolic requirements. Progesterone is a known stimulant of respiration and respiratory drive, and its levels gradually rise from approximately 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> at six weeks to 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> at term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-physiologic-respiratory-changes-and-dyspnea/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Respiratory alkalosis and increased arterial O</strong><strong><sub>2 </sub></strong><strong>tension </strong>&ndash; As a result of the progesterone-induced increase in alveolar ventilation, arterial PCO<sub>2</sub> falls to a plateau of 27 to 32 mmHg during pregnancy. This respiratory alkalosis is followed by compensatory renal excretion of bicarbonate, so that the resultant arterial pH is normal to slightly alkalotic (usually between 7.40 to 7.45) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-physiologic-respiratory-changes-and-dyspnea/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

In fact, the maternal arterial oxygen tension (PaO<sub>2</sub>) is generally increased because of hyperventilation, ranging from 106 to 108 mmHg in the first trimester to 101 to 104 mmHg in the third trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-physiologic-respiratory-changes-and-dyspnea/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Interpretation of the arterial PO<sub>2</sub> is accomplished most easily by looking at the alveolar-arterial oxygen difference, which takes into account the PCO<sub>2</sub> when calculating the alveolar PO<sub>2</sub> (PAO<sub>2</sub>) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-a-a-gradient-alveolar-arterial-gradient-aag\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-physiologic-respiratory-changes-and-dyspnea/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The normal A-a gradient varies with age and can be estimated from the following equation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-physiologic-respiratory-changes-and-dyspnea/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]:</p><p/><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A-a gradient = 2.5 + 0.21 x age in years.</p></div></div><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Upper respiratory system</strong> &ndash; Histologic examination of the upper respiratory mucosa during pregnancy reveals hyperemia, glandular hyperactivity, increased phagocytic activity, and increased mucopolysaccharide content [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-physiologic-respiratory-changes-and-dyspnea/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Pregnant women often experience nasal stuffiness and epistaxis, possibly as a result of these alterations.

This symptom commonly starts during the first or second trimester, the frequency rises during the second trimester, and then is reasonably stable during the third trimester (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55014\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55014 \">figure 5</a>).</p><p>The mechanism of dyspnea during normal pregnancy is not entirely clear. It occurs while the uterus is still relatively small; thus, it cannot be attributed solely to an increase in abdominal girth or upward pressure on the diaphragm. Progesterone-induced hyperventilation is likely to be at least partially responsible, perhaps due to the increase in ventilation above the level needed to meet the rise in metabolic demand. Clinical observations are consistent with this hypothesis. In one observational study, the presence of dyspnea during pregnancy correlated with a low PCO<sub>2</sub>, and the women most likely to experience dyspnea were those who had relatively high baseline (ie, nonpregnant) values for PCO<sub>2 </sub>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-physiologic-respiratory-changes-and-dyspnea/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Two other small studies of men reported increased ventilation during treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-physiologic-respiratory-changes-and-dyspnea/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].

Studies at 38 weeks of gestation showed a slight but statistically significant increase in septal and posterior wall thickness and pulmonary artery pressure in the women with dyspnea. There were also echocardiographic changes suggesting subtle diastolic dysfunction. However, the values for pregnant women with dyspnea were not outside the normal range, and whether these women with significant dyspnea were representative of women with less severe dyspnea of pregnancy is not known.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION OF PREGNANT WOMEN WITH DYSPNEA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a pregnant woman complains of dyspnea, distinguishing between underlying disease (eg, asthma) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52926\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52926 \">table 1</a>), a new problem (eg, pulmonary embolic disease or peripartum cardiomyopathy), and progesterone-induced hyperventilation (dyspnea of pregnancy) can pose a difficult diagnostic problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-physiologic-respiratory-changes-and-dyspnea/abstract/1-4,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4,33</a>].

There is no predictable effect of pregnancy on pre-existing asthma, as approximately equal percentages of patients experience worsening, improvement, or no change in the course of their asthma during pregnancy (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-and-clinical-course-of-asthma-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology and clinical course of asthma in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pregnant women with mild asthma can often be followed by their primary care clinician.

Other common findings suggesting pulmonary embolism are tachypnea, pleuritic chest pain, and hemoptysis, which do not occur with normal dyspnea of pregnancy. Heart rate may increase above the elevated baseline rate of normal pregnancy. Oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry is often abnormal with acute pulmonary embolism, but normal oxygen saturation does not exclude this diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary embolism in pregnancy: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac disease &ndash; Acute dyspnea can also be a sign of coronary artery ischemia or dissection, or an arrhythmia. Women with cardiac disease can present with additional findings of chest pain, irregular heartbeat, and tachycardia. Peripartum cardiomyopathy, a relatively rare disorder that can occur late in pregnancy or in the early postpartum period, has a more gradual rather than an acute presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-physiologic-respiratory-changes-and-dyspnea/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

A history of exposure (eg, bee sting) and simultaneous hypersensitivity symptoms suggest anaphylaxis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-in-pregnant-and-breastfeeding-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis in pregnant and breastfeeding women&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Additional causes of acute upper airway obstruction can include central airway obstruction (typically intraluminal compromise from intrinsic or extrinsic compression from benign or malignant tumors), foreign body, food obstruction, and infection. Again, the history typically helps distinguish among these entities.

Infection is typically identified by history, physical examination, and imaging if indicated. Of note, acute bronchitis can present with wheezing in addition to cough. New or worsening cough may be a presenting symptom in an asthma exacerbation, either with or without a complaint of dyspnea or wheezing. Pregnant women with active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) can present with the additional symptoms of fever, cough, weight loss, night sweats, and malaise.

Common causes include upper airway cough syndrome, asthma, and chronic gastroesophageal reflux. Upper airway cough syndrome typically responds to empiric treatment for post-nasal drip; asthma can often be suspected based on previous history and physical examination, and can be diagnosed with pulmonary function testing; and gastroesophageal reflux can be suspected based on history, noted on barium swallow, or empirically treated.

A history of asthma symptoms, especially antedating pregnancy, suggests asthma as the cause of dyspnea during pregnancy, although occasional patients present with new onset asthma while pregnant. Evidence of reversible airflow obstruction on pulmonary function testing supports the diagnosis of asthma.

Wheezing typically results from airway obstruction caused by bronchoconstriction or excessive mucus production <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> poor clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-physiologic-respiratory-changes-and-dyspnea/abstract/34-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-37</a>]. Asthma is typically diagnosed by a combination of history, physical examination, and demonstration of reversible airflow obstruction on pulmonary function testing. Other less common causes of wheezing include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, extrathoracic disease (eg, anaphylaxis or vocal cord edema or paralysis), or intrathoracic processes.

For women in whom acute pulmonary embolism is not suspected and additional information is needed to make a diagnosis, chest radiography and pulmonary function testing should be the first tests obtained (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F104818\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104818 \">table 2</a>). The choice of tests is determined by symptoms and examination findings. As an example, a woman with wheezing and no other symptoms may only require spirometry for the diagnosis of asthma, but a woman with wheezing and cough may require both spirometry and a chest radiograph to evaluate for infection.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spirometry &ndash; Spirometry is useful for diagnosis of asthma and can be performed safely during pregnancy. The diagnosis of asthma is based upon the presence or history of respiratory symptoms consistent with asthma (most commonly episodic cough, wheezing, or dyspnea provoked by typical triggers), combined with the demonstration of airflow obstruction that improves following an inhaled bronchodilator.

Nevertheless, chest radiography during pregnancy should be done only when there is a good medical reason, and appropriate shielding of the mother's abdomen should be used.

We advise urgent referral of women presenting with moderate or severe acute dyspnea in whom there is concern for pulmonary embolism, pulmonary edema, or a significant asthma exacerbation. Such patients should be seen acutely, and if the woman's usual clinician does not have the training and experience to diagnose and treat these disorders, then the patient should be urgently referred to an appropriate maternal-fetal medicine or other specialist who can see the patient urgently. If the patient cannot be seen immediately, then referral to an emergency department is appropriate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1352927415\"><span class=\"h1\">WOMEN WITH RESPIRATORY INSUFFICIENCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women with mild to moderate respiratory insufficiency are able to have successful pregnancies, but women with severe respiratory insufficiency are at increased risk of adverse maternal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fetal outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-physiologic-respiratory-changes-and-dyspnea/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Although studies in pregnant women are limited, extrapolation of data from healthy control populations demonstrates that the vital capacity in nonpregnant females averages 65 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> and can decrease to 20 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> before hypoxemia manifests. Similarly, the average VO2 max, or aerobic capacity, in a healthy population ranges from 34 to 38 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/min</span>. By term, this increases by 20 percent over baseline secondary to increase in maternal myocardial O2 demand and renal O2 consumption, increased work to ventilate the lung in pregnancy, and the metabolic demands of the fetus. At least two studies have demonstrated that, among healthy pregnant women, VO2 max is preserved throughout pregnancy, and may increase during the second trimester with values near baseline at term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-physiologic-respiratory-changes-and-dyspnea/abstract/44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-46</a>].</p><p>Among women with chronic respiratory compromise, pulmonary function testing (PFTs) can be useful for monitoring women with poor awareness of declines in pulmonary function and those with dyspnea. Routine spirometry in each trimester may be helpful for some patients, such as those affected by cystic fibrosis, as an exacerbation may be heralded by a change in spirometry accompanied by otherwise vague symptoms. There are, however, no standard guidelines for how to use PFT in an obstetric population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
