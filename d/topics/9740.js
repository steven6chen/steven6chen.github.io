However, it has been suggested that the definition be restricted to infants with BW greater than the 97<sup>th</sup> percentile (2 standard deviations above the mean), as this more accurately describes infants who are at greatest risk for perinatal morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-for-gestational-age-newborn/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Using a national reference based on single live births in the United States, infants born at 40 weeks gestation at the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile had BW greater than 4000 g and those at the 97<sup>th</sup> percentile greater than 4400 g [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-for-gestational-age-newborn/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Macrosomia refers to excessive intrauterine growth beyond a specific threshold regardless of gestational age (GA). This condition usually is defined as a BW greater than 4000 or 4500 g. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) supports use of the 4500 g threshold for diagnosis of macrosomia because morbidity increases sharply beyond this weight.</p><p>A grading system for macrosomia has been proposed based on BW (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-macrosomia#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal macrosomia&quot;, section on 'Definition'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 1 &ndash; 4000 to 4499 g</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 2 &ndash; 4500 to 4999 g</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 3 &ndash; &gt;5000 g</p><p/><p>Term infants who are appropriate for gestational age (AGA) have BW between 2500 and 3999 g.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H68825427\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among liveborn infants in the United States born in 2008, the incidence of LGA based on the above grades of macrosomia is 6.6, 0.9, and 0.1 percent for BW of 4000 to 4499 g, 4500 to 4999 g, and &gt;5000 g, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-for-gestational-age-newborn/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Excessive delivery of nutrients to the fetus results in fetal hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia, and increased growth. In IDMs, macrosomia is also associated with disproportionate growth with an increased ponderal index that results in higher chest-to-head and shoulder-to-head ratios, higher body fat, and thicker upper extremity skinfolds compared with LGA offspring of nondiabetic mothers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54212\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54212 \">picture 1</a>). This disproportionate macrosomia increases the risk of birth injuries, especially shoulder dystocia.

In this study, LGA infants with BW &gt;4000 g were more likely to be enrolled in the NICP (criteria included admission to a neonatal intensive care unit [NICU] for a prolonged stay [&gt;72 hours], readmission to a NICU, or transport to a NICU) compared with AGA infants with BW between 2500 and 3999 g (2.7 versus 2.1 percent). The four most common diagnoses in LGA infants, which accounted for 53 percent of the admission diagnoses, were respiratory distress (19 percent), transient tachypnea of the newborn infant (16 percent), hypoglycemia (9 percent), and meconium aspiration (9 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Birth injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Macrosomia predisposes to shoulder dystocia and birth injury, including brachial plexus injury and clavicular fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-for-gestational-age-newborn/abstract/2,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,16,17</a>]. As previously noted, the risk of birth injury increases with the severity of macrosomia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-for-gestational-age-newborn/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, the rate of birth injury for LGA infants is greater in vaginal compared with cesarean deliveries.

This is primarily due to the increased risk of RDS, especially in infants of diabetic mothers [IDM] who are more likely to be delivered prematurely. The higher incidence of cesarean deliveries in LGA infants appears to increase the risk of transient tachypnea of the newborn. In addition, meconium aspiration is a common respiratory complication in LGA infants, perhaps due to the increased risk of perinatal depression.

Ongoing studies will be needed to see whether effects increase the incidence of adult diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.</p><p>The long-term effect of being born LGA on neurodevelopmental outcome is unknown as data are limited. In a study of 2930 children from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Birth Cohort (ECLS-B), the cognitive function of 271 children with birth weights (BW) &ge;90<sup>th</sup> percentile did not differ from that of children with normal BW (defined as between the 5<sup>th</sup> and 89<sup>th</sup> percentile) at 9 months, and 2, 3.5, and 5.5 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/large-for-gestational-age-newborn/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In contrast, there are small observational studies that suggest infants born to mothers with poorly controlled diabetes may be at risk for developmental abnormalities, but the quality of evidence is poor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infant-of-a-diabetic-mother#H713946\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infant of a diabetic mother&quot;, section on 'Neurodevelopmental outcome'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1892632\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants who are born large for gestational age (LGA), especially full-term or post-term infants, are at risk for perinatal morbidity and potentially long-term metabolic complications.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although LGA has been defined as a birth weight (BW) greater than the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile, it has been proposed that a higher threshold of at least 97<sup>th</sup> percentile be used because this more accurately describes infants who are at greatest risk for perinatal morbidity and mortality. At 40 weeks gestation, infants at the 90<sup>th</sup> and 97<sup>th</sup> percentile weigh more than 4000 or 4400 g. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) uses a 4500 g threshold for the diagnosis of macrosomia (excessive fetal growth). (See <a href=\"#H339470\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the United States, the incidence of LGA for infants born at 40 weeks gestation is 6.6, 0.9, and 0.1 percent based on BWs of 4000 to 4499 g, 4500 to 4999 g, and &gt;5000 g, respectively. Although the incidence of LGA has declined in the United States, it appears to be increasing in other countries due to increases in maternal age and weight, and gestational diabetes, and decreases in maternal smoking. (See <a href=\"#H68825427\" class=\"local\">'Incidence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive fetal growth (macrosomia) resulting in LGA is associated with genetic factors (syndromes such as Beckwith-Wiedemann (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62116\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62116 \">table 1</a>)), intrauterine environmental factors (eg, maternal diabetes and obesity, excessive maternal weight gain), and other maternal factors, such as advanced maternal age and multiparity. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors and etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neonatal complications are more frequent in infants who are LGA compared with those who are born appropriate for gestational age (AGA). Complications associated with LGA include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Birth injuries (brachial plexus injury, perinatal asphyxia, and clavicular injury) primarily due to shoulder dystocia (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Birth injury'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Respiratory distress generally due to respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), transient tachypnea of the newborn, or meconium aspiration (see <a href=\"#H1891580\" class=\"local\">'Respiratory distress'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hypoglycemia (see <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Hypoglycemia'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Polycythemia (see <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Polycythemia'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neonatal mortality appears to be increased only in LGA term infants with BW &gt;5000 g compared with AGA term infants. (See <a href=\"#H1891644\" class=\"local\">'Neonatal mortality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of a LGA infant includes screening and treating any complication associated with macrosomia, determining, if possible, the etiology of macrosomia, and providing routine newborn care. We recommend that in the first few hours following delivery, laboratory evaluation include measurement of blood glucose and hematocrit (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals of both diabetic and nondiabetic mothers who were born LGA may have long-term metabolic effects that increase the risk of obesity and insulin resistance.
