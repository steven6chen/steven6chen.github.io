As an example, a review of IVIG therapy for common variable immunodeficiency found that 84 percent of a cohort of 50 patients experienced at least one episode of bacterial pneumonia prior to therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-globulin-therapy-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. During IVIG treatment (mean period of observation 6.6 years, range 1 to 26 years), only 11 percent of patients experienced bacterial pneumonia.</p><p>Estimates of the size of the treatment effect are dependent upon several variables, including the serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels achieved, the patient's underlying primary immune disorder, and associated conditions, such as bronchiectasis. However, several studies have confirmed the aggregate clinical impression that higher serum IgG levels are associated with increased freedom from infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-globulin-therapy-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-intravenous-immune-globulin-ivig-therapy#H396565\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) therapy&quot;, section on 'Selecting a product'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-intravenous-immune-globulin-ivig-therapy#H164158\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) therapy&quot;, section on 'Premedications'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-intravenous-immune-globulin-ivig-therapy#H164407\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) therapy&quot;, section on 'Consent and record keeping'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial doses and schedules</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A standard initial dose of IVIG for the treatment of antibody-deficient patients is 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> (with a range of 400 to 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> every three to four weeks. Standard starting doses for SCIG are in the range of 100 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-globulin-therapy-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. For patients starting on fSCIG, the IVIG monthly dosing considerations apply.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The dose for each patient can be rounded up or down to the nearest full unit in which the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> product is supplied, in order to avoid discarding unused portions of this very costly therapy. The liquid preparations come in several bottle sizes, as do the powders (to a lesser degree). Few pharmacies are able to stock all available sizes and the full range of marketed products due to costs, shortages, and variability in supply. Therefore, it is prudent to consult with the pharmacist preparing the immune globulin and determine how much rounding is necessary to avoid waste.</p><p/><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As an example, if a patient weighing 52 kg is prescribed 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of a 10 percent liquid preparation of IVIG, then the amount of drug required would be (0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">grams/kg)</span> x (52 kg) x (100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/10</span> grams) = 208 mL. Since the smallest vial of most products contains 10 mL, the dose can be rounded up to 210 mL to avoid wasting the 2 mL. If the pharmacy does not have the 10 mL bottle, then the dose could be rounded down to 200 mL. If necessary, the dosing interval could be adjusted one day or two in either direction to help assure adequacy of therapy.</p></div></div><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A loading regimen can achieve steady-state more rapidly and is appropriate in patients with agammaglobulinemia or severe hypogammaglobulinemia (immunoglobulin G [IgG] &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span>. Intravenous loading can be achieved with a single dose of up to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">gram/kg</span>. Alternatively, 100 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg,</span> given on four to five consecutive days could be used as a loading dose, and this approach may have fewer or milder systemic adverse effects. The latter approach is often better tolerated by patients with active infection or those with frail physiology (eg, a neonate, a patient on fluid restriction, those with renal or cardiac disease). Subcutaneous loading can be accomplished by administering 100 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily for five days. Most prescribers do not administer loading doses to patients with higher IgG levels (&gt;300 to 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> prior to the start of therapy).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients initiating therapy during an active infection, it may be prudent to administer only part of the dose initially and to give additional increments over the next several days until the full dose has been administered. This may help to avoid phlogistic reactions associated with active infection. The rate of administration should be slow as well. An example would be starting an infusion at 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/hour</span> and increasing by 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/hour</span> every 15 minutes until a final infusion rate is achieved. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intravenous-immune-globulin-adverse-effects#H659714\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intravenous immune globulin: Adverse effects&quot;, section on 'Concurrent infections/phlogistic reactions'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The 21- or 28-day dosing interval for intravenous infusions is based upon the half-life of IgG in the circulation, which is normally 21 to 22 days, although great variability among individuals and different <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> products exists. Therapeutic levels are reached within one hour of infusion of IVIG, and consistent trough levels are usually achieved after three to six months of therapy. With each intravenous infusion cycle, the peak serum level is typically two to three times the trough level.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravenous dosing intervals greater than four weeks are not recommended. Many patients receiving IVIG at intervals of four weeks or longer report increased arthralgias and other musculoskeletal symptoms, &quot;breakthrough&quot; infections, low-grade fevers, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> feelings of malaise or lethargy toward the end of each treatment interval. In a 2003 survey by the Immune Deficiency Foundation (which was subsequently repeated in a separate survey), 68 percent of patients reported that they could &quot;feel their IVIG wearing off&quot; before their next infusion was due. Many clinicians consider this an indication to shorten that interval to every three or even every two weeks in a stepwise fashion. Intravenous dosing intervals shorter than two weeks are not usually necessary. SCIG should be considered if shorter dosing intervals are desired. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subcutaneous-and-intramuscular-immune-globulin-therapy#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subcutaneous and intramuscular immune globulin therapy&quot;, section on 'Comparison of SCIG with IVIG'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Trough levels</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with hypogammaglobulinemia before therapy, dosing of both IVIG and SCIG should be adjusted primarily based upon the patient's clinical condition. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Individualizing the dose'</a> below.)</p><p>If needed, trough levels of IgG should be measured just before an infusion for patients on IVIG. Consistent trough levels are usually achieved after three to six months of regular therapy. There is no specific frequency of trough level measurement that is considered standard of care. Periodic measurement of trough levels will ensure that complications of the primary disease causing protein loss have not occurred to a degree where they affect IgG retention. For those receiving treatment at home, monitoring assures adequate adherence to prescribed regimens. In addition, the dose can be adjusted regularly in growing children in order to maintain a consistent trough level in the face of increasing body mass.</p><p>There is no single target trough level that correlates to protection from infection in all patients. One set of guidelines in the United States recommends 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> as a minimally acceptable trough level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-globulin-therapy-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], while another suggests that higher trough levels at 800 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> is associated with better outcomes. There are correlations between trough levels and infection for both IVIG and SCIG when patients are considered in aggregate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-globulin-therapy-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/1,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11,12</a>]. Other authorities suggest using an increment of at least 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> above the initial pretreatment level as an indicator of adequate replacement. We suggest individualizing the dose for each patient. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Individualizing the dose'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Individualizing the dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients do well with maintenance intravenous doses of 300 to 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> at three-week intervals or 400 to 800 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> at four-week intervals. However, some patients require alternative dosing regimens with either higher or lower doses or frequencies less than every four weeks in order to accomplish the intended objectives. Thus, there is a wide array of practices applied to patients to achieve best outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-globulin-therapy-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p>The dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> required to achieve and maintain a desired IgG level depends upon several factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient's initial serum IgG concentration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The frequency of administration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The IgG half-life of that particular patient</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The extent of exposure to infectious disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other forms of significant physiologic stress</p><p/><p>Some patients metabolize IVIG more rapidly than others <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> may have renal or gastrointestinal losses.

Most patients do well with maintenance doses of 300 to 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> at three-week intervals or 400 to 800 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> at four-week intervals or at trough (for those on IVIG) serum IgG levels of approximately 500 to 800 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. However, some patients appear to derive clinical benefit from IVIG only at trough levels considerably above 800 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (occasionally above 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span>. The data supporting this were evaluated in aggregate in a meta-analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-globulin-therapy-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The use of higher doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> in patients with common variable immunodeficiency is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-common-variable-immunodeficiency#H2674140972\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of common variable immunodeficiency&quot;, section on 'Indications for higher dosing'</a>.)</p><p>Graphing the patient's dose, trough IgG levels (or random levels if the patient is receiving subcutaneous therapy), and infections over time has been suggested as one method of determining the optimal dose for a given individual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-globulin-therapy-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. A form is provided for doing this, with an example of how it might be completed by a patient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F104748%7EALLRG%2F104750\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef104748 graphicRef104750 \">form 1A-B</a>). Some patients demonstrate a threshold level, above which the incidence of infections dramatically decreases. In some patients with chronic infections, the optimal dose of IgG replacement can also be assessed by following the white blood cell count <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> laboratory indicators of infection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inflammation, such as the erythrocyte sedimentation rate <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the C-reactive protein.</p><p>If a patient is continuing to get infections, it is prudent to determine if the patient is still adherent to other therapies before increasing the dose or shortening the infusion interval of the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a>. For example, patients with asthma or chronic rhinosinusitis who are continuing to get pulmonary or sinus infections should be asked if they are still taking their inhaled or topical nasal glucocorticoid. Sometimes patients will begin to feel better after starting immune globulin and may not be as consistent with concomitant therapies or assume those therapies are no longer needed. It is also important to revisit other conditions that could contribute to symptoms, such as environmental allergies and gastroesophageal reflux.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H376018981\"><span class=\"h3\">&quot;Wear-off&quot; effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients experience symptoms toward the end of the dosing intervals with IVIG, such as increased fatigue, myalgia, and arthralgia or arthritis (sometimes called &quot;wear-off&quot; effects) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-globulin-therapy-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. This has been hypothesized to represent a feature of subphysiologic IgG levels or subphysiologic levels of specific IgG that may result in increased susceptibility to subclinical or clinical infections. In some but not all cases, this can be ameliorated by the addition of adjunct prophylactic antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-globulin-therapy-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Patients who are bothered by these symptoms may benefit from increasing the dose slightly or shortening the infusion interval (changing both dose and interval simultaneously is discouraged) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-globulin-therapy-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Alternatively, the patient could be changed to subcutaneous administration, as wear-off effects are rarely seen with SCIG. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subcutaneous-and-intramuscular-immune-globulin-therapy#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subcutaneous and intramuscular immune globulin therapy&quot;, section on 'Advantages of SCIG'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with normal pretreatment IgG levels</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with deficiencies of specific types of antibodies, such as those against polysaccharide antigens or those with &quot;isolated&quot; deficiencies in the antibody repertoire, the antibodies they lack can only be replaced with standard polyclonal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a>, and therefore, the trough IgG level may not be a useful indicator of the adequacy of therapy. In those types of partial IgG deficiency, full replacement doses (400 to 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> every three weeks or 400 to 800 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> every four weeks) may be necessary, even if the pretreatment serum IgG level is not in the range considered as hypogammaglobulinemic. The total IgG level may be similarly unhelpful in cases in which antibody deficiency coexists with monoclonal gammopathy or polyclonal B cell activation, such as may occur in systemic lupus erythematosus and Epstein-Barr virus-induced lymphoproliferative disease. Thus, patients should be monitored to determine the dose which successfully reduces the incidence and severity of infections for that individual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-globulin-therapy-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/9,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,26</a>].

In phenotypically (nongenetically) diagnosed common variable immunodeficiency, a single attempt (per lifetime) to stop immune globulin therapy is warranted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-globulin-therapy-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>], as a small percentage of patients have demonstrated restored humoral immunity after having been treated. For patients with severe immunodeficiencies, hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) offers the possibility for donor B <span class=\"nowrap\">cell/T</span> cell reconstitution and restoration of antibody function, although this only effectively occurs in a subset of transplanted patients.

A report of two women with common variable immunodeficiency demonstrated that exogenously administered IgG crossed the placenta normally and was also present in normal or elevated levels in the women's colostrum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immune-globulin-therapy-in-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>The maintenance of normal serum immunoglobulin levels in pregnant women with primary immunodeficiencies may have important benefits for both mother and fetus. Early exposure to maternal IgG is believed to influence the developing immune system of the fetus, and the impact of maternal immunoglobulin deficiency on the fetus in the absence of replacement therapy has not been thoroughly studied. In addition, the presence of normal immunoglobulin levels protects the mother through pregnancy and the peripartum period and provides protective antibody for the newborn. Protection of the newborn is important because adequate IgG production in the baby is not usually achieved until six months of age. Since most of the IgG present in the newborn is transferred transplacentally during the third trimester, preterm babies may have very low IgG levels, putting them at increased risk of infection.
