All forms of HAE are characterized by recurrent episodes of angioedema without pruritus or urticaria, which most often affect the skin or mucosal tissues of the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. Although swelling resolves spontaneously in two to four days in the absence of treatment, angioedema can often be temporarily debilitating, and laryngeal angioedema may cause fatal asphyxiation. There are several different forms of HAE. The recommendations in this topic apply to those due to C1 inhibitor (C1INH) deficiency.</p><p>Dental and medical procedures can trigger episodes of angioedema. The various prophylactic therapies that are used prior to dental and medical procedures to prevent attacks will be reviewed here. Long-term prophylaxis to reduce the frequency and severity of angioedema episodes and other issues in the diagnosis and management of HAE are discussed elsewhere:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-angioedema-general-care-and-long-term-prophylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary angioedema: General care and long-term prophylaxis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-angioedema-treatment-of-acute-attacks\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary angioedema: Treatment of acute attacks&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-angioedema-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-exacerbating-factors-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary angioedema: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, exacerbating factors, and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary angioedema: Pathogenesis and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-angioedema-with-normal-c1-inhibitor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary angioedema with normal C1 inhibitor&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3814766289\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR SHORT-TERM PROPHYLAXIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common indications for short-term prophylaxis are medical or dental procedures (ie, &quot;preprocedural&quot; prophylaxis) or anticipated stressful events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-temporary-prophylaxis-before-procedures-or-stress-to-prevent-angioedema-episodes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Prophylaxis may also be given for a brief period of time (ie, &quot;extended&quot; short-term prophylaxis) for travel to remote areas or countries in which there may not be ready access to health care or for a period of weeks or months during which increased stress is anticipated (eg, students during exam periods) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-temporary-prophylaxis-before-procedures-or-stress-to-prevent-angioedema-episodes/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In contrast, the regular use of medications over years to reduce the severity or frequency of angioedema episodes is referred to as long-term prophylaxis and is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-angioedema-general-care-and-long-term-prophylaxis#H230015922\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary angioedema: General care and long-term prophylaxis&quot;, section on 'Approach to long-term prophylaxis'</a>.)</p><p>The need for short-term prophylaxis is influenced by the availability of one of the &quot;on-demand&quot; treatments: C1 inhibitor (C1INH) concentrates, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=icatibant-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">icatibant</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecallantide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ecallantide</a>. If none of the on-demand therapies are available, then preprocedural prophylaxis is especially important. Mechanisms of action, efficacy, dosing, and administration of on-demand therapies are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-angioedema-treatment-of-acute-attacks#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary angioedema: Treatment of acute attacks&quot;, section on 'First-line agents: Dosing, efficacy, and adverse reactions'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3013787820\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients already on long-term prophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients already receiving long-term prophylaxis with C1INH or androgens, dosing can be modified prior to a procedure. For example, patients receiving regular injections of plasma-derived C1INH (pdC1INH) can arrange to have an injection immediately before the procedure or patients taking androgens can increase the dose for five days prior to the procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2559109945\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk associated with specific procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The highest risk procedures are intubation, oral surgery, and major dental work (ie, cutting of tissue or injections of anesthetics), which can trigger symptoms in most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-temporary-prophylaxis-before-procedures-or-stress-to-prevent-angioedema-episodes/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. These procedures can induce both cutaneous and laryngeal edema. Short-term prophylaxis should always be administered prior to these procedures, even if the patient has access to acute therapies, as the potential consequence of laryngeal edema is too severe to rely upon on-demand treatment alone.</p><p>In a series of 577 tooth extractions, 37 percent of episodes resulted in angioedema when prophylaxis was not given, and the swelling was facial, laryngeal, or a combination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-temporary-prophylaxis-before-procedures-or-stress-to-prevent-angioedema-episodes/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Symptoms occurred up to 72 hours after the procedure, with a mean time to onset of 14 hours. Among procedures in which patients received prophylaxis with C1INH concentrate, 21 percent resulted in swelling, at a mean of 8 hours after the procedure. Some attacks began during the night while the patients were asleep and were therefore recognized later than if they had occurred during waking hours. The fewest attacks were seen in patients receiving 1000 units of C1INH concentrate, which was administered 1 hour before the procedure.</p><p>Minor dental procedures (eg, routine cleanings, filling of cavities, crown placement, restorative work, etc) are lower risk, and the patient's past response to similar interventions can guide the decision to give prophylaxis. However, patients vary in their sensitivity to procedure-induced swelling. Those who have developed swelling in similar situations in the past should receive preprocedural prophylaxis in the future, even for minor interventions. Those who have tolerated these procedures in the past are likely to continue to do so. If a patient's tolerance for a given procedure is unknown, short-term prophylaxis is indicated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3814766315\"><span class=\"h2\">Typical timing of onset of symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Angioedema typically begins within 48 hours of the intervention but can occur later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-temporary-prophylaxis-before-procedures-or-stress-to-prevent-angioedema-episodes/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Patients should be advised that swelling often occurs one day or so <strong>after</strong> the procedure, and a specific plan of treatment should be in place for symptoms that arise during this period, including access to on-demand therapies. In the study of tooth extractions discussed above, patients who received prophylaxis with C1INH concentrate were at highest risk during the 12 hours after the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-temporary-prophylaxis-before-procedures-or-stress-to-prevent-angioedema-episodes/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Some attacks began during the night while the patients were asleep and were therefore recognized later than if they had occurred during waking hours. For this reason, some experts advise patients to schedule procedures as early as possible in the day.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3814766679\"><span class=\"h1\">AVAILABLE AGENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The agents that can be used for short-term prophylaxis are C1 inhibitor (C1INH) concentrate, androgens, and plasma products. These are reviewed here, with availability, efficacy, and adverse effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-temporary-prophylaxis-before-procedures-or-stress-to-prevent-angioedema-episodes/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Note that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecallantide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ecallantide</a> (a kallikrein inhibitor) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=icatibant-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">icatibant</a> (a bradykinin-receptor antagonist), which are other on-demand therapies, are <strong>not</strong> used before procedures, because these two agents have short half-lives (six hours or less). Thus, they are only used to stop an attack once it has commenced. Their utility as prophylactic agents has not been defined.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranexamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tranexamic acid</a> (TA), an antifibrinolytic agent, has been recommended by some guidelines but without theoretical rationale or practical evidence of efficacy. Therefore, the authors do not recommend use of TA for short-term prophylaxis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1486741557\"><span class=\"h2\">Comparative efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overall, C1INH is likely the most effective therapy for short-term prophylaxis, followed by androgens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-temporary-prophylaxis-before-procedures-or-stress-to-prevent-angioedema-episodes/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The efficacy of plasma is less clear. Retrospective analyses provide relative comparisons, but there are no controlled trials directly comparing the effectiveness of different therapies for short-term prophylaxis.</p><p>Evaluation of the efficacy of various agents in short-term prophylaxis is further complicated by the unpredictability of HAE attacks. Procedures that have triggered attacks in a given patient do not necessarily do so reproducibly, and major interventions that would be expected to precipitate attacks in most patients may not, even in the absence of prophylaxis. A registry-based survey has provided some additional real world data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-temporary-prophylaxis-before-procedures-or-stress-to-prevent-angioedema-episodes/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Because of this inherent unpredictability, it is prudent to give prophylaxis if there is any uncertainty about the risk of an attack.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3814766699\"><span class=\"h2\">C1 inhibitor concentrate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plasma-derived C1 inhibitor (pdC1INH) concentrate may be administered intravenously for short-term prophylaxis. Note that subcutaneous administration of C1INH may not be equivalent if used in this manner, and intravenous preparations are strongly preferred. pdC1INH concentrate is also the treatment of choice for short-term prophylaxis during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-temporary-prophylaxis-before-procedures-or-stress-to-prevent-angioedema-episodes/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the United States, two human plasma-derived products (pdC1INH) are available for intravenous administration, Cinryze and Berinert. Cinryze is US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved from prophylaxis, although there is no reason to believe that Berinert would not be equally effective. Berinert P is used throughout Europe, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Argentina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-temporary-prophylaxis-before-procedures-or-stress-to-prevent-angioedema-episodes/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A <a href=\"topic.htm?path=c1-esterase-inhibitor-recombinant-human-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">recombinant human C1 inhibitor</a> (rhC1INH) preparation, conestat alfa (Ruconest in Europe and the United States, Rhucin in other countries) is also available. rhC1INH given one hour prior to the procedure has also been used successfully for short-term prophylaxis in case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-temporary-prophylaxis-before-procedures-or-stress-to-prevent-angioedema-episodes/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, the half-life (three hours) of the recombinant product is significantly shorter than that of the plasma-derived product (30 to 39 hours), and its efficacy for short-term prophylaxis may not be identical.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3814766774\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>pdC1INH concentrate as a single prophylactic agent is generally accepted as effective based upon retrospective series and observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-temporary-prophylaxis-before-procedures-or-stress-to-prevent-angioedema-episodes/abstract/6,12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,12-14</a>]. In one series, 33 adults and 8 children received 1000 units of pdC1INH within the 24 hours preceding 91 dental and medical procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-temporary-prophylaxis-before-procedures-or-stress-to-prevent-angioedema-episodes/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Angioedema occurred in only 2 percent of procedures. Another series reported angioedema in 21 percent of tooth extractions, following prophylaxis with either 500 or 1000 units of pdC1INH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-temporary-prophylaxis-before-procedures-or-stress-to-prevent-angioedema-episodes/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3814766836\"><span class=\"h3\">Dose and timing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on a small number of publications, 1000 units is effective in most children and adults, although we suggest using 20 units per kg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-temporary-prophylaxis-before-procedures-or-stress-to-prevent-angioedema-episodes/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>C1INH concentrate is ideally given one hour prior to or immediately before the major procedure. However, if necessary, dosing can be given further in advance of the procedure. The half-life of a single weight-based dose of pdC1INH is 30 to 39 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-temporary-prophylaxis-before-procedures-or-stress-to-prevent-angioedema-episodes/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>], and in the study discussed above, administration up to 24 hours before was sufficient to prevent attacks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-temporary-prophylaxis-before-procedures-or-stress-to-prevent-angioedema-episodes/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, a dose of pdC1INH could conceivably be consumed within 24 hours in some patients, and the median time to maximal serum concentrations is 0.5 to 1 hour [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-temporary-prophylaxis-before-procedures-or-stress-to-prevent-angioedema-episodes/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. For these reasons, it is preferable to administer pdC1INH as close in time to the procedure as possible.

The choice of androgen is based largely upon availability, since differences among drugs have not been well-characterized. Danazol is widely available throughout the world. Stanozolol is not produced commercially in the United States, although it is available by prescription and can be compounded by individual pharmacies. Tibolone and oxandrolone may be less virilizing than other agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-temporary-prophylaxis-before-procedures-or-stress-to-prevent-angioedema-episodes/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>].

However, elevations in transaminases have been observed when excessively large doses were given (eg, 4 to 16 mg of stanozolol daily in adults) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-temporary-prophylaxis-before-procedures-or-stress-to-prevent-angioedema-episodes/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. These doses are not routinely used. A pediatric endocrinology specialist should be consulted if androgens are used in children.</p><p>There are no absolute contraindications to short-term prophylaxis with attenuated androgens, except possibly pregnancy, since androgens can cause virilization of female fetuses. Androgens were even used successfully in pregnant women with HAE in the past when other options were lacking, with close collaboration with an obstetrician.

In a review of the literature, 148 cases were identified in which FFP was administered as short-term prophylaxis, with six instances of angioedema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-temporary-prophylaxis-before-procedures-or-stress-to-prevent-angioedema-episodes/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

However, it is obtained from single donor units, rather than pooled plasma, and each unit undergoes serologic testing for viral markers. The risk of infection for a unit of FFP is identical to that of red blood cells, which are also obtained from single donors. The issue of disease transmission from red blood cells (and therefore FFP) is presented in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-of-hiv-from-blood-transfusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk of HIV from blood transfusion&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-transmission-of-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and transmission of hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1942107638\"><span class=\"h1\">OUR APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several guidelines and practice parameters on the treatment of HAE have been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-temporary-prophylaxis-before-procedures-or-stress-to-prevent-angioedema-episodes/abstract/9,29-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,29-34</a>]. However, few studies have evaluated short-term prophylaxis specifically, and recommendations in the guidelines are largely extrapolated from data of efficacy of different agents in long-term prophylaxis. The approach presented in this topic review is consistent with available guidelines, although it is largely based on the experience of the authors and editors.</p><p>As mentioned previously, angioedema triggered by a procedure usually occurs within 48 hours of the procedure, so it is important that plans be made for both the procedure and the postprocedure period. Because angioedema does not typically develop during or immediately after the procedure, we do not insist that patients only receive dental care to hospital-based clinics or put other additional restrictions on them, provided on-demand therapy is accessible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3656544419\"><span class=\"h2\">General precautions</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Communication between the patient, specialist performing the procedure, and <span class=\"nowrap\">allergist/immunologist</span> (or other HAE expert) is critical. Both the clinician performing the procedure and the patient should know how to reach the HAE expert clinician in case advice is needed. A printable form summarizing the acute treatment of HAE is available to assist in this communication (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F70252\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef70252 \">form 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ideally, two doses of an on-demand therapy should be available to patients undergoing procedures, and these doses should be available to the patient both in the clinic and for two to three days after the procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that the patient be observed for at least two hours after the procedure, before being discharged home. However, as mentioned above, swelling related to the procedure may begin within the ensuring 48 hours, so patients must also have a plan in place to access on-demand therapy if needed.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3960745245\"><span class=\"h2\">High-risk procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two principal approaches for preprocedural prophylaxis for high-risk procedures, such as oral surgery and intubation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F83117\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83117 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-angioedema-temporary-prophylaxis-before-procedures-or-stress-to-prevent-angioedema-episodes/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plasma-derived C1INH (pdC1INH) concentrate (20 units per kg) may be given one hour before the procedure, with two additional doses available for on-demand use if symptoms develop. Alternatively, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecallantide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ecallantide</a> (a kallikrein inhibitor) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=icatibant-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">icatibant</a> (a bradykinin-receptor antagonist) could be used if symptoms develop (although these are not used <strong>before</strong> the procedure, as their efficacy as prophylaxis is not known). Dosing of pdC1INH concentrate is discussed above.

It may also be given to patients traveling to remote areas in which they may not be able to access health care. (See <a href=\"#H3814766289\" class=\"local\">'Indications for short-term prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Angioedema typically begins within 48 hours of a triggering event or procedure. Patients should be advised that swelling often occurs one day or so <strong>after</strong> the procedure, and a specific plan of treatment should be in place for symptoms that arise during this period. (See <a href=\"#H3814766315\" class=\"local\">'Typical timing of onset of symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some procedures, such as oral surgery, intubation, and dental work that involves injections or cutting of tissues, reliably trigger symptoms in most patients. However, individuals vary in their susceptibility to attacks. If a patient has had symptoms with a given procedure, then it should be considered high risk for that patient, and prophylaxis should be administered for future similar procedures. (See <a href=\"#H2559109945\" class=\"local\">'Risk associated with specific procedures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>None of the available therapies confer complete protection from an attack, and the supervising clinician must be prepared to recognize and manage angioedema with on-demand therapies immediately available.

We prefer weight-based dosing (ie, 20 units per kg). This should be injected as close in time to the procedure as is feasible (preferably within the hour before the procedure). At least two additional doses of an on-demand therapy (C1INH, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=icatibant-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">icatibant</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecallantide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ecallantide</a>) should be available to the patient in case symptoms develop either during the procedure or during the two to three days following the procedure.
