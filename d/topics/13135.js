These events mostly occur in patients with structural heart disease (that may not have been previously diagnosed), particularly coronary heart disease.</p><p>The event is referred to as SCA (or aborted SCD) if an intervention (eg, defibrillation) or spontaneous reversion restores circulation. The event is called SCD if the patient dies. However, the use of SCD to describe both fatal and nonfatal cardiac arrest persists by convention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-sudden-cardiac-death#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of sudden cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death&quot;, section on 'Definitions'</a>.)</p><p>The cardiac diseases that lead to the genesis of the arrhythmia resulting in cardiac collapse and sudden death are varied, and the association with sudden death in some cases is poorly understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Identification of the patient at risk for sudden death and identification of the factors that precipitate the fatal arrhythmia continue to represent a major challenge. This topic will review the mechanisms and etiology of SCA. Treatment for SCA, the evaluation of survivors, and the outcomes of SCA are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advanced-cardiac-life-support-acls-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-survivor-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the survivor of sudden cardiac arrest&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-and-outcomes-following-sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis and outcomes following sudden cardiac arrest in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ARRHYTHMIC MECHANISMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The exact mechanism of collapse in an individual patient is often impossible to establish since, for the vast majority of patients who die suddenly, cardiac activity is not being monitored at the time of their collapse. As a result, the mechanism can only be inferred, based upon information obtained after the process has been initiated.</p><p>However, there have been many cases in which the initiating event has been witnessed or recorded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. This has usually occurred in patients being continually monitored in the coronary care unit or with a 24-hour ambulatory ECG recording device or an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). Ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) account for the majority of episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. However, a bradyarrhythmia is responsible for some cases of SCD.</p><p>The distribution is different among patients with an ICD. Arrhythmic death accounts for 20 to 35 percent of deaths; post-shock or primary pulseless electrical activity (PEA, also called electromechanical dissociation) is a frequent cause of SCD in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death in heart failure and cardiomyopathy&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>The distribution of causes is also different with unmonitored out-of-hospital SCD. VF and pulseless VT appear to be responsible for 25 to 35 percent of episodes, although estimates vary widely. PEA accounts for as many as 25 percent of all cases of SCD.</p><p>Among patients who collapse in an unmonitored setting in whom the exact time of onset and the etiologic arrhythmia is uncertain, asystole is often the first rhythm observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Asystole correlates with the duration of the arrest and may be the result of VF that has been present for several minutes or longer and then leads to the loss of all electrical activity as a result of hypoxia, acidosis, and death of myocardial tissue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67777\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef67777 \">waveform 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>In approximately 80 percent of patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/VF,</span> the sustained ventricular arrhythmia is preceded by an increase in ventricular ectopy and the development of repetitive ventricular arrhythmia, particularly runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These spontaneous arrhythmias are present for a variable period of time prior to the development of <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/VF</span>.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sustained monomorphic VT can accelerate to a rapid rate and then degenerate into ventricular fibrillation (VF). However, the relationship between monomorphic VT and SCD has been debated, with some studies suggesting that this arrhythmia is present in only a minority of patients with SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Thus, sustained monomorphic VT may simply be the company kept by VF or, in the appropriate setting such as recurrent coronary ischemia, it may provide a rapid wavefront that becomes fractionated, leading to VF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A sustained polymorphic VT can degenerate into VF. This is most often the result of underlying ischemia (ie, polymorphic VT without QT prolongation of the sinus QRS complex), although it may also result from acquired or congenital QT prolongation. A very rare cause of polymorphic VT without QT prolongation is a genetic abnormality associated with catecholaminergic polymorphic VT (a result of a abnormality of a ryanodine or calsequestrin gene).

A bradyarrhythmia is more often associated with a nonischemic cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], while pulseless electrical activity or asystole are the most common rhythms seen with a pulmonary embolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-prognosis-and-follow-up-of-acute-pulmonary-embolism-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment, prognosis, and follow-up of acute pulmonary embolism in adults&quot;</a>.) In some cases, the bradyarrhythmia may result in a ventricular tachyarrhythmia as an escape mechanism.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism of VF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ventricular fibrillation results from multiple localized areas of microreentry without any organized electrical activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The most likely mechanism is rotating spiral waves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This almost always occurs in the setting of underlying myocardial disease (or abnormalities in repolarization as in the long QT syndrome) that is often diffuse, resulting in heterogeneity of depolarization and the dispersion of repolarization. This disparity of electrophysiologic properties is a precondition for reentry. A triggering event is usually necessary to precipitate the arrhythmia in a vulnerable heart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reentry-and-the-development-of-cardiac-arrhythmias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reentry and the development of cardiac arrhythmias&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diversity in conduction and recovery parameters (myocardial heterogeneity) results in fragmentation of the impulse as it travels through the myocardium, producing multiple areas of localized reentry or multiple spiral wavelets of myocardial activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Since there is no organized electrical activity or myocardial depolarization, there is no uniform ventricular contraction resulting in failure of the heart to generate a cardiac output. With the development of global ischemia, the rate of VF decreases because of a reduction in the rotation period of the spiral waves which results from the increase in their core area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The ECG in established VF shows high-frequency undulations or fibrillatory waves that are irregular in amplitude, morphology, and periodicity, occurring at a rate above <span class=\"nowrap\">320/minute;</span> organized QRS complexes are not seen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67777\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef67777 \">waveform 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, at the very onset of VF, the fibrillatory waves may be coarse with a tall amplitude, and may appear to be regular (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80454\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef80454 \">waveform 2</a>). The QRS complexes in this setting are indistinguishable from the T waves, and they appear to be sinusoidal in configuration. This finding may represent a brief period of an organized ventricular flutter, with a rate exceeding 260 beats per minute. In some cases, the coarse fibrillatory waves may resemble polymorphic VT. These initial ECG changes are collectively referred to as type I VF, and may be associated with spontaneous defibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>As the duration of VF increases, progressive cellular ischemia and acidosis develop, resulting in an electrophysiologic deterioration, manifested by an increase in fibrillation cycle length and prolonged diastole duration between fibrillation action potentials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/7,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,17,18</a>]. During this later (type II) VF, the fibrillatory waves rapidly become finer and more irregular in amplitude, duration, and cycle length; spontaneous resolution has not been observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].

However, the frequency of CHD is much lower in SCDs occurring under the age of 30 to 40 (eg, 24 percent under the age of 30 in a review of SCDs in the United States in 1999, and 8 percent in a series of autopsies in military recruits) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/19,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,26</a>].<br/><br/>These observations were largely made from analyses of all reported SCDs in the United States using the diagnosis on the death certificate, which is of uncertain accuracy. A similar frequency of CHD was noted in a study of 84 consecutive survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Immediate coronary angiography revealed clinically significant coronary disease in 60 (71 percent) of the patients, 40 of whom (48 percent of all patients) had an occluded coronary artery. The absence of an occluded coronary artery in the other 20 patients does not preclude an acute coronary syndrome (or ischemia) since absence of occlusion on early angiography is seen in 60 to 85 percent of patients with a non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome and in up to 28 percent of patients with an ST elevation MI.

The causes include trauma, bleeding, drug intoxication, intracranial hemorrhage, pulmonary embolism, near-drowning, and central airway obstruction.</p><p/><p>Although not specifically mentioned in most of these studies, heart failure (HF) is a relatively common cause of SCD. SCD accounts for 30 to 50 percent of deaths in patients with heart failure (HF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], and the incidence of SCD appears to be increased during periods of worsening HF symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Although the risk of both arrhythmic and nonarrhythmic death can be reduced with appropriate chronic HF therapy, the SCD risk remains elevated. Thus, virtually all SCD survivors with HF receive an ICD. A detailed discussion of arrhythmic events and the effect of medical therapy in HF patients is presented separately.

It has been suggested that progressive pump failure, sudden arrhythmic death, and sudden death during episodes of clinical worsening each account for approximately one-third of deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

The event is referred to as SCA (or aborted SCD) if an intervention (eg, defibrillation, cardioversion, antiarrhythmic drug) or spontaneous reversion restores circulation. The event is called SCD if the patient dies. However, the use of SCD to describe both fatal and nonfatal cardiac arrest persists by convention. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The exact mechanism of collapse in an individual patient is often impossible to establish since, for the vast majority of patients who die suddenly, cardiac electrical activity is not being monitored at the time of their collapse. However, in studies of patients who were having cardiac electrical activity monitored at the time of their event, ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) accounted for the majority of episodes, with bradycardia or asystole accounting for nearly all of the remainder.

In about one-third of cases, the tachyarrhythmia is initiated by an early R on T ventricular premature beat (VPB); in the remaining two-thirds, the arrhythmia is initiated by a late cycle VPB. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Arrhythmic mechanisms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are many cardiac and noncardiac causes for a sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia that can result in SCD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F62184\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62184 \">table 1</a>).
