The risk of hemorrhage has been related to the size and appearance of the varices, as well as the degree of hepatic dysfunction.

Pre-primary prophylaxis refers to measures aimed at preventing the development of varices. Measures aimed at preventing hemorrhage in patients with a history of variceal hemorrhage are referred to as secondary prophylaxis.</p><p>An ideal treatment of portal hypertension would be one that is universally effective, safe, easy to administer, and cost-effective. While such a treatment does not currently exist, there are several medical and surgical modalities available for primary prophylaxis of variceal hemorrhage.

Portal pressure is equal to the product of the portal venous inflow and the resistance to outflow from the portal venous system. Portal venous inflow is controlled by the tone of the mesenteric arterioles. Thus, a decrease in mesenteric arteriolar tone results in increases in portal venous inflow and consequently portal pressure. Normal portal pressure is between 5 and 10 mmHg. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=portal-hypertension-in-adults#H72827656\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Portal hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=portal-hypertension-in-adults#H72827684\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Portal hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Hepatic venous pressure gradient'</a>.)</p><p>Outflow resistance from the portal system may be considered as two separate resistances in parallel. The first is due to resistance to flow through the portal vein, liver, and hepatic vein; the second is due to resistance to flow through collaterals from the portal system that independently drain into the systemic circulation. It is now recognized that the increase in resistance to flow within the liver is in part due to intrahepatic vasoconstriction secondary to impaired nitric oxide production within the liver. It is estimated that about 30 percent of the intrahepatic resistance may be reversible and is not due to fixed changes in the vasculature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>In patients with cirrhosis, elevated portal pressure results from a combination of increased portal inflow due to splanchnic arteriolar vasodilation and elevated resistance to outflow through distorted hepatic sinusoids. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-ascites-in-patients-with-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of ascites in patients with cirrhosis&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Varices decompress the portal vein and return blood to the systemic circulation in patients with portal hypertension. A normal pressure gradient between the portal and hepatic veins (the hepatic venous pressure gradient or HVPG) is 1 to 5 mmHg. Varices form when the pressure gradient between the portal and hepatic veins rises above 10 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Thus, therapies aimed at decreasing portal venous pressure may decrease the formation of varices and the risk of variceal hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"#H748332\" class=\"local\">'Dose titration'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING FOR VARICES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with cirrhosis should undergo endoscopic screening for esophageal varices so that prophylactic therapy can be given to those with varices that are at increased risk of bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. In patients with cirrhosis predominantly due to HCV, the risk of varices appears to be very low if the patient has a platelet count &ge;150,000 and the liver stiffness of &lt;20 kPa on transient elastography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. It may be reasonable to follow these patients with annual platelet counts and transient elastography scans. If the platelet count drops to &lt;150,000 or the liver stiffness increases to &ge;20 kPa, then endoscopic screening for varices should be performed. (See <a href=\"#H70835313\" class=\"local\">'Primary prophylaxis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prediction-of-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis#H129709535\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prediction of variceal hemorrhage in patients with cirrhosis&quot;, section on 'Predictive factors'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noninvasive-assessment-of-hepatic-fibrosis-ultrasound-based-elastography#H8550330\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noninvasive assessment of hepatic fibrosis: Ultrasound-based elastography&quot;, section on 'Transient elastography'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H157005252\"><span class=\"h2\">Rationale behind screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Identifying and treating patients with high-risk varices leads to improved clinical outcomes. Estimates are that 30 percent of patients with compensated cirrhosis and 60 percent of patients with decompensated cirrhosis have varices at the time of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The annual rate of a first hemorrhage episode among those with varices is 12 percent, and each episode of variceal hemorrhage is associated with up to a 15 to 20 percent risk of mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/2,10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,10-13</a>]. </p><p>Studies have shown that primary prophylaxis with a nonselective beta blocker or endoscopic variceal ligation reduces the risk of first variceal hemorrhage and decreases the risk of bleeding-related mortality. In addition, overall mortality is lower in patients treated with endoscopic variceal ligation, and there is a trend toward decreased mortality in patients treated with nonselective beta blockers. (See <a href=\"#H747559\" class=\"local\">'Nadolol and propranolol'</a> below and <a href=\"#H750670\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopic variceal ligation'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H157005347\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening methods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Screening is typically done with an upper endoscopy.

The ratio of the platelet count to the spleen size (expressed as a standard deviation score) and clinical prediction rules that include platelet count, spleen size, and albumin have been shown to predict varices in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In addition, a study using transabdominal ultrasound of the lower esophagus in patients with chronic liver disease found that patients with varices had a higher mean esophageal wall thickness than patients who did not have varices (7.3 to 8.7 mm versus 3.7 mm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>In study of 117 patients with compensated cirrhosis, a score that incorporated liver stiffness, spleen size and platelet count was used to identify a subgroup of patients with clinically significant portal hypertension (area under the receiver operating characteristic 0.92, 95% CI 0.89-0.98) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H56864681\"><span class=\"h1\">PRE-PRIMARY PROPHYLAXIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pre-primary prophylaxis aims to prevent the development of varices in patients with portal hypertension who have not yet developed varices.

However, treatment with nonselective beta blockers is not recommended because studies have failed to show a benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/2,3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,8</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a randomized trial, 213 patients with portal hypertension but without esophageal varices were assigned to either receive the nonselective beta blocker <a href=\"topic.htm?path=timolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">timolol</a> or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The primary endpoint was the development of varices or variceal hemorrhage. After a median follow-up of 55 months, the primary endpoint was reached in 42 of 108 patients (39 percent) in the timolol group and in 42 of 105 patients (40 percent) in the placebo group (p = 0.89).

Typically, one of two approaches is used for primary prophylaxis: pharmacologic prophylaxis using a nonselective beta blocker, or endoscopic prophylaxis using endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL). Both beta blockers and EVL are superior to no treatment for the prevention of a first variceal hemorrhage. Some data suggest that the risk of variceal hemorrhage may be lower with EVL compared with beta blockers, but there is no benefit with regard to mortality and EVL puts patients at risk for procedure-related complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Beta blockers have a low risk of serious side effects, though many patients do not tolerate them. Beta blockers may also decrease the risk developing of ascites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, possibly by reducing portal pressure and decreasing bacterial translocation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

If the patient does not tolerate therapy with a beta blocker, we will treat with EVL on a case by case basis. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carvedilol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Carvedilol</a> is an alternative to treatment with a nonselective beta blocker. (See <a href=\"#H747625\" class=\"local\">'Carvedilol'</a> below.)</p><p>Variceal enlargement may occur despite use of a beta blocker. The natural history of varices in this setting is uncertain, but given the importance of variceal size in determining bleeding risk, it is our approach to ligate varices that have enlarged despite beta blocker therapy. However, this approach has not been studied in clinical trials and differs from the published guidelines.

The choice of a nonselective beta blocker or EVL depends upon whether the patient can tolerate a nonselective beta blocker and whether the patient is willing to accept the risks of EVL and undergo the multiple endoscopic procedures that are required. Because some data suggest EVL may be more effective than beta blockers in patients with large varices, our preference is to treat such patients with EVL when possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>Approaches to primary prophylaxis that are <strong>not</strong> recommended include nitrates (either alone or in combination with beta blockers), shunt therapy, or sclerotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/2,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,22</a>]. In addition, combination therapy with beta blockers and EVL is not recommended for primary prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H57868503\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific therapies</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H69669989\"><span class=\"h3\">Pharmacologic approaches</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pharmacologic therapy for primary prophylaxis for variceal hemorrhage is comprised primarily of nonselective beta blockers, though other agents have been studied.

The WHVP is obtained by either wedging the catheter in the end tributaries of a hepatic vein or by balloon occlusion of the hepatic vein.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If HVPG monitoring is being used to guide therapy, the hemodynamic goal of treatment with a nonselective beta blocker is to decrease the HVPG by 10 percent or to &le;12 mmHg.

If a higher dose is not tolerated or a goal reduction in HVPG cannot be achieved, then EVL is indicated. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H747559\"><span class=\"h5\">Nadolol and propranolol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nadolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Nadolol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> are two nonselective beta blockers that are used for primary prophylaxis against variceal hemorrhage. We typically use nadolol (since it can be given once daily) at a starting dose of 40 mg per day. Propranolol is usually started at a dose of 20 mg twice a day. However, beta blockers may not be well tolerated in patients with severe vasodilation and systemic hypotension (mean arterial pressure &lt;85 mmHg). As a result, it may be prudent either to avoid beta blockers or to start with a lower dose (eg, 20 mg per day of nadolol) in such patients. Nadolol is renally excreted, and its starting dose has to be modified in response to renal insufficiency. In addition, beta blockers can decrease renal blood flow, so renal function should be monitored.</p><p>Oral or intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> produces a 9 to 23 percent decrease in the HVPG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/23,34-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,34-37</a>]. This change is mostly due to a reduction in WHVP, which is primarily caused by decreased portal venous inflow secondary to mesenteric arteriolar constriction. At higher doses of propranolol, decreases in heart rate and cardiac output contribute to a further lowering of portal pressure by decreasing splanchnic blood flow. Propranolol also can prevent the rise in HVPG observed during moderate physical exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

The lack of response in some patients may be due to a concomitant rise in collateral <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hepatic sinusoidal resistance, or a reflex increase in hepatic arterial flow. The latter mechanism preserves sinusoidal perfusion in the face of decreased portal venous inflow.

This in turn leads to a further reduction in portal pressure. However, it also can result in significant drops in mean arterial blood pressure (average decrease of 23 percent in one study), which may be poorly tolerated by patients with cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>The effect on HVPG appears to be greater in patients with Child B or C cirrhosis compared with patients with Child A cirrhosis, possibly due to changes in hepatic metabolism of the drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. For patients with Child A cirrhosis, a dose of 12.5 mg twice a day has been recommended, whereas a dose of 6.25 mg twice a day has been recommended for patients with Child B or C cirrhosis. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carvedilol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Carvedilol</a> does not decrease the glomerular filtration rate, but it is associated in with an increase in plasma volume. As a result, patients may require the addition of a diuretic or, for those already on a diuretic, an increase in the dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. </p><p>Multiple studies of the hemodynamic effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carvedilol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carvedilol</a> suggest that carvedilol causes a dose-related decrease in HVPG of about 20 percent from baseline, which is significantly higher than is seen with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/49-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-58</a>]. As an example, one study with 35 patients with cirrhosis found that the mean decrease in HVPG with carvedilol was 20 percent, compared with 13 percent for propranolol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

In addition, six patients in the EVL group bled as a result of ulcers related to the banding. In a second randomized trial with 168 patients with varices, the rate of hemorrhage was similar for those who received carvedilol and those who underwent EVL (6.9 versus 8.5 percent), hemorrhage-related mortality (4.9 versus 4.6 percent), and overall mortality (20 versus 13 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

In patients with cirrhosis, clinically important adverse effects include bronchoconstriction, heart failure, and impotence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Beta blockers rarely induce liver failure from decreased portal blood flow because total hepatic blood flow is usually maintained by an increase in hepatic arterial flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Despite the inability of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nadolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nadolol</a> to cross the blood-brain barrier due to its hydrophilic nature (in contrast to the highly lipophilic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a>), central nervous system side effects of the two medications do not differ. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-beta-blockers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of beta blockers&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The routine use of beta blockers in patients with cirrhosis and refractory ascites has been called into question. A prospective study of 151 patients with cirrhosis and refractory ascites found that median survival was significantly longer in patients who did not receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> versus those who did (20 versus five months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Independent predictors of mortality were Child C cirrhosis, hyponatremia, refractory ascites due to renal failure, and beta blocker therapy. </p><p>Whether the beta blockers accounted for the increased mortality is uncertain, since the study was not randomized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Patients who received beta blockers were more likely to have varices (100 versus 4 percent). There was also a trend toward a higher proportion of patients with Child C cirrhosis in the beta blocker group (74 versus 61 percent). </p><p>It has been theorized that one way in which beta blockers may lead to increased mortality among patients with advanced cirrhosis is by reducing cardiac output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. This is important because low mean arterial blood pressure is associated with a poor prognosis in patients with advanced cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>] and because reduced cardiac output is a strong predictor of hepatorenal syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. If the increased mortality in this study was in fact due to beta blocker use, a possible explanation for the increased mortality is that the beta blockers may have precipitated hepatorenal syndrome. In addition, many of the patients died from complications related to <span class=\"nowrap\">sepsis/spontaneous</span> bacterial peritonitis. In such patients, the decreased cardiac output related to beta blockade may have compounded the hypotension related to vasodilation from sepsis.

The retrospective study included 194 patients with decompensated cirrhosis and ascites who did not have a history of variceal hemorrhage. Varices were present in 132 patients (68 percent). Predictors of decreased survival included higher Child class (hazard ratio [HR] 1.2) and the presence of varices (HR 1.2). Beta blocker use was not associated with decreased survival. However, this study was not restricted to patients with refractory ascites.</p><p>The use of beta blockers in patients who develop spontaneous bacterial peritonitis has also been associated with worse outcomes, including reduced transplant-free survival rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].

However, EVL has been associated with significant complications, including hemorrhage from banding-induced ulcerations. Because of the potential complications associated with EVL, the procedure should be performed by endoscopists with expertise in prophylactic banding.

Trials that compared EVL with beta blockers have had variable results. Some show a decreased risk of hemorrhage with EVL, while others do not. Several meta-analyses have also been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/18,79-82\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,79-82</a>].

The analysis found that there was no difference between the treatments with regard to gastrointestinal hemorrhage (RR 0.79), all-cause mortality (RR 1.06), or hemorrhage-related mortality (RR 0.66). While there was a decrease in variceal hemorrhage with EVL compared with beta blockers (RR 0.72; 95% CI 0.4 to 0.96), variceal hemorrhage was not significantly different between the two groups when only high-quality trials were considered (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.17).</p><p/><p>Whether there is a benefit from adding beta blockers in patients who have undergone EVL for primary prophylaxis has not been well studied. In one randomized trial with 144 patients with high-risk varices, combination therapy was not more effective than EVL alone in preventing hemorrhage or death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. However, patients receiving combination therapy were less likely to develop recurrent varices. Conversely, there does not appear to be a benefit from adding EVL to beta blocker therapy. This was demonstrated in a trial that included 140 patients who were assigned to either combination therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nadolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nadolol</a> plus EVL or nadolol monotherapy. Combination therapy was not more effective than nadolol alone in preventing a first variceal bleed, though patients in the nadolol monotherapy arm had fewer adverse events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. </p><p>The expense, inconvenience, and risk of EVL compared with beta blockers are additional factors that must be considered in choosing EVL as primary therapy. An economic analysis found that its cost-effectiveness (compared with beta blockers) depended upon whether quality of life was considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. In a model that considered quality of life to be superior with EVL compared with beta blockers, EVL was cost-effective. By contrast, EVL was not cost-effective when considering life-years gained alone. Assessing comparative quality of life in these settings is not straightforward and hence the validity of this observation remains unclear. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=a-short-primer-on-cost-effectiveness-analysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;A short primer on cost-effectiveness analysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Another consideration is that EVL may not be a permanent solution since varices can recur after initial eradication. In one study, for example, varices recurred in 22 percent of patients (on average four months after initial therapy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].

For patients with Child A cirrhosis who have small varices without red signs, we suggest expectant management with routine upper endoscopy to monitor for the development of red signs or for variceal enlargement (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H70835313\" class=\"local\">'Primary prophylaxis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prediction-of-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis#H129709535\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prediction of variceal hemorrhage in patients with cirrhosis&quot;, section on 'Predictive factors'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with small varices with red signs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> Child B or C cirrhosis, we suggest treatment with a nonselective beta blocker rather than esophageal variceal ligation (EVL) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Studies have shown that treatment of patients with small varices with nonselective beta blockers reduces the likelihood of progression to large varices and decreases the probability of a first variceal hemorrhage. Data are lacking regarding the use of EVL for primary prophylaxis in patients with small varices. However, treatment with variceal ligation is a reasonable alternative if the patient does not <span class=\"nowrap\">tolerate/has</span> a contraindication to therapy with a beta blocker, in patients with refractory ascites, or if there is variceal enlargement despite treatment with a beta blocker. (See <a href=\"#H747559\" class=\"local\">'Nadolol and propranolol'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with medium varices, we suggest treatment with either a nonselective beta blocker or EVL (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Both treatments have been shown to be effective in such patients. The choice of a nonselective beta blocker or EVL depends upon whether the patient can tolerate a nonselective beta blocker, whether a provider with expertise in EVL is available, and whether the patient is willing to accept the risks of EVL and undergo the multiple endoscopic procedures that are required. (See <a href=\"#H70835313\" class=\"local\">'Primary prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with large varices, we suggest treatment with EVL rather than a nonselective beta blocker (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Some data suggest EVL may be more effective than beta blockers in patients with large varices. Treatment with a nonselective beta blocker is a reasonable alternative in patients who are unwilling to accept the risks of EVL or undergo multiple endoscopic procedures for treatment or if a provider experienced in EVL is not available. (See <a href=\"#H750670\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopic variceal ligation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients being treated with nonselective beta blockers, we typically use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nadolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nadolol</a> (since it can be given once daily), starting with a dose of 40 mg per day. We then titrate the dose based upon the patient's hemodynamic response. (See <a href=\"#H748332\" class=\"local\">'Dose titration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The hemodynamic goal of treatment with a nonselective beta blocker is to decrease the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) by 10 percent or to &le;12 mmHg. If the HVPG is not being used to monitor treatment, the dose of the beta blocker may instead be titrated to achieve a resting heart rate of about 55 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/minute</span> (reflecting what is generally considered to be the maximal tolerated dose). (See <a href=\"#H748332\" class=\"local\">'Dose titration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients, especially those with decompensated cirrhosis (Child B or C), who are receiving beta blockers should be monitored closely for side effects. Beta blockers may need to be stopped if intolerable side effects develop, or if the patient develops ascites that becomes refractory to treatment, worsening hepatic encephalopathy, or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. (See <a href=\"#H21558131\" class=\"local\">'Side effects and safety'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approaches to primary prophylaxis that are not effective or are associated with high complication rates include nitrates (either alone or in combination with beta blockers), surgical shunts, or endoscopic sclerotherapy. In addition, performing EVL in patients already receiving nonselective beta blockers does not appear to improve outcomes.
