The alveolar&ndash;arterial oxygen difference during the first 12 hours after reperfusion and chest radiograph score were better in the two groups receiving the antagonist, as compared with the control group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gene therapy</strong> &ndash; Gene-based therapy offers the potential to genetically modify organs to withstand the stresses of the transplant process. Gene transfer has been achieved experimentally using vectors such as viruses to allow endobronchial transfer of several proteins of interest. As examples, transfer of soluble type 1 interleukin receptor, interleukin (IL)-10, and IkappaB suppressor genes have been shown to attenuate ischemia-reperfusion injury in animal models of lung transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lung-graft-dysfunction/abstract/81-83\" class=\"abstract_t\">81-83</a>]. Optimization of gene delivery systems and diminished inflammatory response to the vectors are still important requirements to move this strategy to the clinical lung transplantation setting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Preconditioning</strong> &ndash; The principle of preconditioning is that tissues exposed to one insult can develop tolerance to a subsequent injury. Ischemic preconditioning has been shown to be effective in hepatic resection and in coronary artery bypass surgery, but its role in clinical lung transplantation remains unproven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lung-graft-dysfunction/abstract/84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,85</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Heme oxygenase pathway</strong> &ndash; Selective overexpression of heme oxygenase-1 confers protection against ischemia-reperfusion in experimental models; the mechanism remains poorly understood, but may involve the three products generated by the enzyme (biliverdin, carbon monoxide, and free iron) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lung-graft-dysfunction/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. Future studies are required to determine the role of manipulation of this pathway in protection of the lung after reperfusion.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35\"><span class=\"h1\">RETRANSPLANTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retransplantation for primary graft dysfunction (PGD) is generally associated with a poor outcome and is avoided by most transplant centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lung-graft-dysfunction/abstract/44,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,87</a>]. A review that included 23 patients retransplanted for PGD found significantly shorter survival compared with retransplantation for bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome or severe airway narrowing at the anastomotic site; at one year only about 30 percent of patients with retransplantation for PGD were still alive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite significant advances in organ preservation, surgical technique, and perioperative care, PGD is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality after lung transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lung-graft-dysfunction/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. As an example, in a 10 center cohort study that enrolled 1255 patients between 2002 and 2010, PGD grade 3 at 48 or 72 hours after transplant was associated with increased 90 day (increased absolute risk 18 percent) and one year mortality (increased absolute risk 23 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lung-graft-dysfunction/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) grading system for PGD has been studied to determine whether it is predictive of outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lung-graft-dysfunction/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>] (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Grading system'</a> above). Studies have found that the score at 48 hours correlates well with short and long term outcomes. In one study of 402 lung transplant recipients, severe (Grade 3) PGD at 48 hours was associated with an increased risk of short- and long-term mortality and increased length of hospital stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lung-graft-dysfunction/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. The change in the ratio of arterial oxygen pressure to inspired oxygen concentration (PaO<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FiO<sub>2</sub>)</span> over the first 12 hours appears to be a better predictor of outcome than the initial PGD score. As an example, among 96 patients with a PGD score of 3 on arrival to the ICU, those with a 20 percent improvement in PaO<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FiO<sub>2</sub></span> over 12 hours had a better outcome than those who did not improve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lung-graft-dysfunction/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Later time points may be even more important; in a separate analysis, grade 3 PGD at 72 hours was the most important time-point associated with worse survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lung-graft-dysfunction/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECT ON CHRONIC LUNG ALLOGRAFT DYSFUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most series have found that patients who survive primary graft dysfunction (PGD) are at increased risk for subsequent development of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lung-graft-dysfunction/abstract/90-93\" class=\"abstract_t\">90-93</a>]. In a retrospective cohort study of 334 lung transplant recipients, the severity of initial PGD correlated with the risk of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lung-graft-dysfunction/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. However, a previous single center study did not find such a relationship [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lung-graft-dysfunction/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-lung-transplant-rejection-bronchiolitis-obliterans\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic lung transplant rejection: Bronchiolitis obliterans&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A potential explanation for this relationship comes from evidence suggesting that early inflammation associated with ischemia reperfusion (IR) injury promotes the development of alloimmunity and chronic human allograft rejection, manifest as bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-lung-graft-dysfunction/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. The degree of pro-inflammatory cytokine release after transplantation may have an important role in the interplay of innate and adaptive immune mechanisms that ultimately promote donor-specific alloimmunity predisposing to BOS. Hence, strategies to prevent IR injury have an important role not only in diminishing early post-transplant complications, but also in improving long-term outcomes after transplantation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H38\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H39\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features and diagnosis</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) after lung transplantation represents a multifactorial injury to the transplanted lung(s) that develops in the first 72 hours after lung transplantation; the pathology is typical of acute lung injury rather than immunologic rejection. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both cold ischemic storage and ischemia-reperfusion injury appear to contribute to PGD. Other contributors may include donor thromboembolism, recipient aspiration or pneumonia, and ventilator-associated lung injury. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The International Society of Heart Lung Transplantation has proposed a grading system for the classification of PGD based on the ratio of arterial oxygen pressure to inspired oxygen concentration (PaO<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FiO<sub>2</sub>)</span> ratio (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F78107\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78107 \">table 1</a>). The scores are calculated at the time of reperfusion of the second lung (T0), and again at 24, 48, and 72 hours (T24, T48, and T72). The PGD score may be useful prognostically and is most commonly used in patients with bilateral lung transplants. The PGD score at 72 hours may be the most important time-point for predicting survival. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Grading system'</a> above and <a href=\"#H36\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment and prevention</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with PGD less than grade 3 severity or with grade 3 severity and normal pulmonary artery pressures improve with conventional supportive treatment, including lung protective ventilation and optimal fluid management &#160; (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among those with more severe grade 3 PGD (ie, persistent difficulty with oxygenation and elevated pulmonary artery pressures), we suggest adding iNO (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We typically start at a concentration of 20 ppm. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Inhaled nitric oxide'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with severe grade 3 PGD who don't respond adequately to optimal ventilator and fluid management and iNO, we suggest initiating extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Most patients will stabilize with venovenous ECMO, although some patients will require venoarterial ECMO. ECMO has a greater likelihood of success when started within 24 hours of the onset of severe PGD. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retransplantation for PGD is generally associated with a poor outcome. (See <a href=\"#H35\" class=\"local\">'Retransplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PGD appears to be a risk factor for subsequent development of chronic lung allograft dysfunction. (See <a href=\"#H37\" class=\"local\">'Effect on chronic lung allograft dysfunction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Strategies to prevent PGD include use of adequate donor lung selection and optimization of preservation, storage, intraoperative management, and reperfusion techniques.
