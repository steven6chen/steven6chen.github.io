In turn, the degree of left ventricular dysfunction is determined by the extent of myocardial necrosis or infarct size. Thus, pump failure and increased mortality result when the infarct is large and ventricular compromise is severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-patency-and-outcome-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Prompt and sustained coronary arterial patency has repeatedly been found to limit infarct size. Among patients with an acute ST-elevation MI (STEMI), over 90 percent have complete occlusion of the culprit artery. Patency can be achieved by primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), fibrinolysis or a combination of both modalities. In addition, there are many factors (hemodynamic, anatomic, cellular) that influence coronary artery patency regardless of the technique used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52322\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52322 \">figure 1</a>).

Seventy-nine percent of those with complete (&ge;70 percent) ST segment resolution had TIMI grade 3 flow and their 30-day mortality was 1 percent.

Although patients without ST-segment resolution may still have a patent IRA, they are still at increased risk for mortality, which is likely due to extensive microvascular and myocardial tissue injury.

Improvement after stenting is expected in patients with a residual stenosis but not in those with evidence of microvascular damage and compromised myocardial perfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-patency-and-outcome-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Optimal therapy of no-reflow is uncertain and an area of ongoing investigation.

One study determined the corrected TIMI frame count (i.e., the number of frames required for contrast to reach a standardized distal landmark) in 1817 nonculprit arteries of patients entered into the TIMI 4, 10A, 10B, and 14 fibrinolytic trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-patency-and-outcome-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. At 90 minutes, blood flow in the nonculprit vessels was 45 percent slower than normal flow in the absence of a myocardial infarction. Patients with reduced blood flow in nonculprit arteries had a higher incidence of regional wall motion abnormalities within the distribution of the nonculprit vessel. Culprit and nonculprit blood flows were directly related at baseline, and relief of the residual stenosis in the culprit artery with PCI restored its flow to a level equal to the nonculprit artery; however, even after successful PCI, blood flow in both culprit and nonculprit arteries remained 45 percent below normal.</p><p>Correlates of slower nonculprit artery flow included:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulsatile flow pattern (systolic flow reversal) in the nonculprit artery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left anterior descending culprit artery location</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased systolic blood pressure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced ventricular performance on ventriculography</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased double product (heart rate X blood pressure)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Greater percent of stenosis in the nonculprit artery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Greater percent of the culprit artery bed lying distal to the stenosis</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Microvascular dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As described above, successful reperfusion after an acute MI has generally been defined as restoration of normal flow in the infarct-related epicardial coronary artery. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'TIMI flow grade'</a> above.) However, even after restoration of patency in the IRA, there may be a persistent impairment in tissue perfusion due to microvascular dysfunction. This has been called the no-reflow phenomenon and remains an important consideration after primary PCI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=suboptimal-reperfusion-after-primary-percutaneous-coronary-intervention-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Suboptimal reperfusion after primary percutaneous coronary intervention in acute ST elevation myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'No-reflow phenomenon'</a>.)</p><p>Microvascular dysfunction is also a component of ischemia-reperfusion injury. Brief periods of ischemia at the onset of reperfusion, a phenomenon called ischemic postconditioning, may improve microvascular flow and reduce infarct size. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myocardial-ischemic-conditioning-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myocardial ischemic conditioning: Pathogenesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myocardial-ischemic-conditioning-clinical-implications#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myocardial ischemic conditioning: Clinical implications&quot;, section on 'Therapeutic applications'</a>.)</p><p>Thus, although the open artery hypothesis is well established, emerging data emphasize the impact of myocardial reperfusion injury and early adverse cellular and tissue-level events that accompany acute myocardial infarction. For example, a study of annual trends in door-to-balloon times and in-hospital mortality, employing data from 96,738 patients undergoing primary PCI for acute ST elevation MI, found no significant overall change in 30-day, risk- adjusted mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-patency-and-outcome-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. These observations do not challenge the importance of an open artery among patients with acute ST segment elevation MI, but they do suggest that additional strategies may be needed to reduce mortality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">SPONTANEOUS REPERFUSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spontaneous reperfusion occurs in both ST elevation and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (MI).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">ST-elevation MI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or fibrinolysis is standard therapy for acute STEMI, spontaneous reperfusion occurs in an increasing proportion of patients over time. It has been estimated that, in the absence of reperfusion therapy, the proportion of patients with an ST elevation MI who have an occluded infarct-related artery (IRA) falls from 87 percent at four hours to 65 percent at 12 to 24 hours and to 45 percent at one month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-patency-and-outcome-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/1,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,22</a>].</p><p>As described below, the attainment of a patent IRA after fibrinolysis is associated with lower rates of morbidity and mortality. Outcomes are also improved with spontaneous reperfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-patency-and-outcome-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p>In the PAMI trials, for example, 16 percent of patients had TIMI 3 (normal) flow before PCI (ie, spontaneous reperfusion) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-patency-and-outcome-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Patients with TIMI 3 flow had the following significant benefits: greater clinical and angiographic evidence of myocardial salvage; a lesser likelihood of presenting in or developing heart failure; and a lower rate of early and late mortality (six month mortality: 0.5 versus 2.8 and 4.4 percent with TIMI grade 2 and <span class=\"nowrap\">0/1</span> flow, respectively).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Non-ST elevation MI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spontaneous early reperfusion is much more common in patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes. Coronary angiography, performed during the acute period demonstrates that the IRA is not occluded in 60 to 85 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-patency-and-outcome-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>]. The non-occluding thrombi are primarily grayish-white in appearance (ie, platelet-rich), and therefore less likely to respond to fibrinolytic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-patency-and-outcome-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], in contrast to being almost always reddish (ie, fibrin-rich) in patients with ST elevation MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-patency-and-outcome-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In addition, microvascular perfusion is often reduced in patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome; as a result, the ongoing mechanism of ischemia is more likely recurring distal embolization than epicardial coronary artery occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-patency-and-outcome-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">IRA PATENCY AND OUTCOME AFTER FIBRINOLYSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patency of the infarct-related artery (IRA) following fibrinolytic therapy or primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has beneficial effects on both the short- and long-term outcome of patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI). This benefit is most often seen when therapy is given within two to three hours of symptom onset (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F53374\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53374 \">figure 4</a>). A meta-analysis from the Fibrinolytic Therapy Trialists' (FTT) Collaborative Group found that the absolute mortality benefit from fibrinolytic therapy at five weeks was 3 percent for those presenting within six hours from symptom onset, 2 percent for those presenting within 7 to 12 hours, and a nonsignificant 1 percent for those presenting within 13 to 18 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-patency-and-outcome-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

In the Western Washington Intracoronary Streptokinase trial, for example, patients with a patent IRA had a mortality at one month that was one-half that of patients with a closed artery. The difference in mortality between the two groups persisted at one-year follow-up, as patients with patent IRAs had less than one-fifth the mortality of those with occluded arteries. Similar results were seen in the TIMI 1 trial, with significant reductions in 21-day and one-year mortality in patients with patent IRAs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-patency-and-outcome-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>The beneficial effect of coronary artery patency on short-term mortality suggested by early fibrinolytic trials was subsequently supported by an overview of four German multicenter clinical trials that included early coronary angiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-patency-and-outcome-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Complete reperfusion of the IRA as determined by coronary angiography 90 minutes after the initiation of fibrinolytic therapy was associated with the significant reduction in in-hospital mortality. Only TIMI grade 3 flow conferred a survival benefit (2.7 percent); patients with TIMI grade 2 flow fared no better than those with TIMI <span class=\"nowrap\">0/1</span> flow (6.6 and 7.1 percent, respectively).</p><p>This important observation was subsequently validated by a number of clinical trials (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F82475\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82475 \">figure 5</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-patency-and-outcome-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/33-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-37</a>]. GUSTO 1, for example, tested the hypothesis that early and sustained patency of an infarct-related vessel is associated with improved survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-patency-and-outcome-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. Forty-one thousand subjects from over 1000 hospitals in 15 countries who were identified at symptom onset were randomized to streptokinase (1.5 million units over 60 minutes) plus either subcutaneous heparin (12,500 units BID) or intravenous heparin (5000 unit bolus followed by 1000 units per hour), or to accelerated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a> (recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator or tPA) with intravenous heparin (accelerated refers to the rate at which alteplase was given).

The time of fibrinolysis was also important and independent of the fibrinolytic agent used (alteplase or streptokinase) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-patency-and-outcome-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

Patency rates for streptokinase and alteplase were only different at the 90-minute mark. Over time, streptokinase &quot;caught up&quot; with alteplase so that patency for both agents was similar at four hours. The earlier and more complete infarct vessel patency associated with alteplase at 90 minutes appeared to contribute to the lower mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-patency-and-outcome-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>].</p><p>When data from 11,228 subjects enrolled in GUSTO 1 were analyzed, 45 percent of patients had an open IRA, defined as the presence of TIMI grade 3 flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-patency-and-outcome-after-myocardial-infarction/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Those with an open artery had a lower 30-day mortality (1.5 versus 6.3 percent for a closed artery) even after adjusting for baseline clinical predictors of outcome including ejection fraction. At one year, the mortality rate among those surviving after the first 30 days was still lower for those with an open vessel (3.3 versus 8.8 percent); however, after adjusting for clinical variables, patency was no longer a significant predictor and the only predictor of mortality was the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56352\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56352 \">figure 6</a>).</p><p>Patency of the IRA is also associated with lower morbidity.

Patients undergoing PCI (22 percent of the group) had a significantly lower incidence of the composite outcome of recurrent ischemia or angina, recurrent MI, and in-hospital mortality (3.4 versus 6.6 percent without PCI); the association between PCI and lower mortality persisted after adjusting for factors associated with a higher in-hospital mortality (odds ratio 0.67, 95% CI 0.49-0.92). With a propensity analysis, which helps to adjust for treatment selection bias, there was still a significant reduction in recurrent ischemia with PCI (10.8 versus 14.6 percent), and a strong, but not statistically significant trend toward a reduction in in-hospital mortality (odds ratio 0.73, 95% CI 0.53-1.01).</p><p>The randomized trials (BRAVE-2, DECOPI, and OAT) that have evaluated late PCI have included patients at different time periods after symptom onset, ranging from more than 12 hours to up to 28 days.

There were two major findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Final left ventricular infarct size was significantly smaller in the late PCI group (median 8 versus 13 percent).

The patients were randomly assigned to optimal medical therapy alone or with routine PCI with stenting. Important characteristics of the patients in this trial included high-risk features (LVEF less than 50 percent or proximal occlusion of a major epicardial vessel) and the absence of recurrent clinical ischemia or the demonstration of severe ischemia on stress testing.

At four years, the rate of the composite end point was not statistically different between the PCI and the medical therapy groups (17.2 and 15.6 percent, respectively).
