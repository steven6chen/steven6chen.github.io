Therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLCs) such as increased physical activity, dietary <span class=\"nowrap\">modification/weight</span> loss, and smoking cessation are of proven benefit and are likely to improve outcomes beginning within a matter of months. Adjunctive drug therapies of proven benefit are principally <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and statins and in patients with MI or heart failure, they include beta blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. TLCs and adjunctive drug therapies of proven benefit are likely to have additive benefits in the secondary as well as primary prevention of CVD.</p><p>Other individuals without established CVD are also at high risk of cardiovascular events and include individuals with multiple traditional risk factors for CVD or patients with chronic kidney disease.</p><p>Interventions to prevent CVD events in those with established disease or at high risk will be summarized here. More detailed discussions of each risk factor are presented elsewhere.

These are termed secondary preventive interventions. All healthcare providers should attempt to lower the risk of a subsequent event in all patients with CVD using therapeutic lifestyle changes as well as adjunctive drug therapies of proven benefit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENTS AT HIGH RISK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We define patients at high risk as those with a prior CVD event as well as those whose 10-year risk is &gt;10 percent. These latter subjects are likely to include most patients with diabetes, and those with chronic kidney disease (CKD) with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;45 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/per</span> 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> as well as many with metabolic syndrome, the constellation of abdominal obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia, which is also called the insulin resistance syndrome.

These issues need to be considered by the healthcare provider and each of his or her patients.</p><p>The utilization of adjunctive drug therapies of proven benefit in older adults should also consider the potential for drug-drug interactions as well as the higher rates of CKD. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H469717407\"><span class=\"h1\">MULTIPLE RISK FACTOR INTERVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This topic addresses our approach to the control of individual modifiable risk factors in patients with a wide range of prior occlusive cardiovascular events (secondary prevention) or those at high risk of developing a first event (primary prevention) due to multiple risk factors. There is evidence that clinical outcomes are improved to the extent that all risk factors are controlled. This issue is discussed elsewhere.

Among interventions to improve parameters of the lipid profile, statins have the largest and most persuasive totality of evidence. With respect to adjunctive therapies to statins, only <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ezetimibe-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ezetimibe</a> has been shown to produce a small but significant improvement in CVD outcomes. We and others recommend that all patients with atherosclerotic CVD, as well as individuals with a 10-year risk &gt;7.5 percent, be prescribed evidence-based doses of a high-intensity statin regardless of the baseline LDL-C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-events-in-those-with-established-disease-or-at-high-risk/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H14525374\" class=\"local\">'Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease'</a> above.) </p><p>Large randomized trials of secondary prevention have demonstrated the benefit of lipid lowering with statin therapy on subsequent risks of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and other CVD events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-events-in-those-with-established-disease-or-at-high-risk/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Statins improve outcomes across a broad range of baseline LDL-C levels in patients with established CVD or those at high risk. Among over 130,000 patients randomly assigned to statin or placebo and over 40,000 randomly assigned to more intensive statin compared with usual statin regimens, there are statistically significant and clinically important reductions in the rates of subsequent MI, stroke, and CVD death. Statin therapy lowers the risk of death by 15 to 20 percent and lowers the risk of nonfatal cardiovascular events by an even greater degree. The reductions in the risk of stroke may be as high as 30 percent over a wide range of lipid values. Further, those assigned to a statin had statistically significant and clinically important reduction in all-cause mortality (10 percent per 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]</span> reduction in LDL [rate ratio 0.90, 95% CI 0.87-0.92]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-events-in-those-with-established-disease-or-at-high-risk/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. </p><p>In these trials, lower is better with regard to LDL-C and there is no threshold below which there is no incremental benefit. The benefit seen in these trials could be due to a greater degree of LDL-C lowering, to pleiotropic effects of a higher statin dose, or both.</p><p>In addition to LDL-C lowering, statins have beneficial effects on triglyceride and HDL-C levels.

These findings suggest that the primary goal for patients at high risk of CVD vascular events is to achieve the largest LDL-C reduction possible with statin therapy; this is generally accomplished with intensive rather than moderate dose therapy.

Among these adjunctive therapies to statins, only ezetimibe has been shown to add a small but statistically significant benefit on clinical CVD events. PCSK9 antibodies have been approved by United States and European regulatory agencies based on Phase 2 trials showing beneficial effects on lipid parameters in the presence of optimal statin therapy. Phase 3 trials of clinical outcomes are ongoing, the vast majority of which are adjunctive therapies to high-potency statins in familial hyperlipidemia.

In addition, many patients with multiple risk factors or chronic kidney disease have similarly high risks of these CVD events. (See <a href=\"#H14525374\" class=\"local\">'Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Therapeutic lifestyle changes that include the identification and treatment of multiple major modifiable risk factors for coronary heart disease (dyslipidemia, hypertension, smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, and diabetes) reduce the risk of future CVD events and benefits are additive. For virtually all such patients, adjunctive drug therapies will be necessary. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Dyslipidemia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Hypertension'</a> above and <a href=\"#H33\" class=\"local\">'Diabetes'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adjunctive drug therapies that are of proven benefit include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, statins, beta blockers, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. The benefits of statins and aspirin are, at the very least, additive. In addition, adjunctive drug therapies provide beneficial effects on risks of CVD through mechanisms that may or may not be directly linked to the risk factors discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H35\" class=\"local\">'Other adjunctive therapies'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Dyslipidemia'</a> above.)&nbsp;</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-events-in-those-with-established-disease-or-at-high-risk/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Smith SC Jr, Benjamin EJ, Bonow RO, et al.
