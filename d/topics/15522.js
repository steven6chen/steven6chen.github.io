Secondary prevention of SCD refers to medical or interventional therapy undertaken to prevent SCD in patients who have experienced symptomatic life-threatening sustained <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/VF</span> or have been successfully resuscitated from sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). The secondary prevention of SCD in patients with HF and cardiomyopathy will be reviewed here, with emphasis on the role of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs). The different types of ventricular arrhythmias, the effects of HF therapy on ventricular arrhythmias, and the role of electrophysiologic testing are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ventricular-arrhythmias-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ventricular arrhythmias in heart failure and cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The approaches to the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias related to specific heart muscle diseases, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy and isolated left ventricular noncompaction, are discussed elsewhere.

Ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) are the most common arrhythmic causes of SCD, although bradyarrhythmias and pulseless electrical activity (PEA) are responsible in 5 to 33 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. </p><p>More severe HF is associated with a higher overall mortality rate and a higher absolute rate of SCD, but a decreasing proportion of SCD to total deaths.

However, post-mortem interrogation of ICDs demonstrated that 25 percent of sudden deaths in ICD patients (representing 5 percent of all deaths) were caused by inability to defibrillate VF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Initial treatment should be directed at the underlying disorder. However, prior to concluding that SCA was due to a reversible cause, a thorough evaluation should be performed, usually involving a heart rhythm specialist. For example, in a patient who presents with VF and is found to have mild hypokalemia, it is generally not appropriate to assign the cause of the SCA just to the low potassium level. </p><p>Correction of a reversible cause of SCA or sustained VT is most likely to be adequate in one of several settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polymorphic VT or VF that is preceded by clear evidence of myocardial ischemia or acute myocardial infarction (MI) &ndash; In such cases, revascularization is often adequate for the purpose of reducing the risk of SCD.

Guideline-directed medical therapy should be applied, and follow-up evaluation with a cardiologist soon after discharge should be arranged for additional risk stratification. A repeat evaluation of LV function is recommended &gt;40 days post-MI and &gt;90 days after revascularization to determine if the patient qualifies for ICD implantation based on primary prevention indications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

However, more contemporary observational studies or registries support these findings. In a cohort of 6996 patients with new onset ventricular arrhythmia in the setting of preexisting coronary heart disease and HF (from the National Veterans Administration database), 1442 patients had an ICD implanted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. At three-year follow-up, the patients who received an ICD had significant reductions in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality compared with those without an ICD (37 versus 55 percent and 23 versus 36 percent, respectively; adjusted odds ratio 0.52 for all-cause mortality and 0.56 for cardiovascular mortality), with no difference in noncardiac death. The benefit occurred despite a significantly lower frequency of use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta blockers, and statins. This reduction in risk of death (28 percent) was similar to that seen in AVID (31 percent). In a smaller study of 357 patients who received an ICD for secondary prevention with much longer follow-up (mean 82 months), 208 persons (59 percent) received an ICD therapy for ventricular tachyarrhythmia, while 44 percent of participants died without receiving any ICD therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. An analysis of the NCDR ICD Registry evaluated mortality in 46,685 patients with ICDs implanted for secondary prevention indications in contemporary practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The mortality rate in this registry at one year was 10 percent compared with 8 to 11 percent among ICD patients enrolled in the secondary prevention randomized clinical trials (AVID, CIDS, CASH). Overall, the magnitude of the benefit of ICD therapy for secondary prevention in this real-world cohort was similar to or greater than that in the randomized trials, although mortality also remains high due to significant comorbidities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1595156\"><span class=\"h3\">Effect in elderly patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Randomized clinical trials evaluating the role of the ICD for secondary prevention included only a minority of patients who were &ge;75 years old. A meta-analysis of pooled individual patient data from three major randomized trials (CASH, CIDS, and AVID) comparing ICD with antiarrhythmic therapy for secondary prevention included 252 patients (out of 1866 total, or 13.5 percent) who were &ge;75 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This meta-analysis suggested that the survival benefit from ICD therapy may be reduced in elderly patients compared with younger patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. In contrast, other studies have shown older patients to benefit equally from primary or secondary prevention ICD therapy as younger patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>].</p><p>While clinical trials enrolled relatively few older adult patients, the National Cardiovascular Data Registry ICD Registry provides the ability to examine outcomes in much larger numbers of patients in real-life clinical practice. In an analysis of 12,420 Medicare patients who were ages 65 years or older (mean age 75 years) who underwent initial ICD implantation between 2006 and 2009 for secondary prevention of SCD, the overall risk of death at two years was 21.8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, there was a twofold difference in total mortality between patients &ge;80 years of age and those who were ages 65 to 69 years (28.9 versus 14.7 percent; adjusted risk ratio 2.01, 95% CI 1.85-2.33). The study did not include a control group of similarly matched patients without an ICD; therefore no conclusions can be drawn about any potential total mortality benefit from placing the ICD for secondary prevention. However, nearly four in five patients over age 65 years who received an ICD for secondary prevention were alive two years later, indicating that age alone should not be the deciding criterion for ICD placement. Rather, multiple clinical factors should be considered including comorbidities, functional status, and competing risks of mortality, with the patient and family engaged in a shared decision-making process.</p><p>These results suggest that ICD use in elderly patients should be individualized. Patients with few comorbidities may benefit, while those with significant other illnesses may be more likely to die of non-arrhythmic causes. Clinicians should consider issues of competing mortality risk, co-morbidities, risk of complications, and patient preferences for end-of-life care. In addition, treatment options should be carefully discussed with patients and families to allow shared decision making.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1595188\"><span class=\"h3\">Effect in heart failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who are being evaluated for an ICD for secondary prevention and who have at least class II HF symptoms, significant LV systolic dysfunction, left bundle branch block, and a QRS duration &ge;150 milliseconds should be strongly considered for an ICD that also provides cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT).

For such patients with an ischemic cardiomyopathy, we generally perform an invasive electrophysiology (EP) study and, if the patient has inducible VT, implant an ICD. For patients with a nonischemic cardiomyopathy, an EP study is less informative, although it may reveal conduction abnormalities or bundle branch reentrant VT.

(See <a href=\"#H1075672\" class=\"local\">'Reversible causes of SCA or sustained VT'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1593018\" class=\"local\">'Patients with transient or reversible disorders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with HF or cardiomyopathy who have had syncope and either induced or spontaneous VT, we recommend treatment with an ICD for secondary prevention of SCD (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Patients with syncope'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy, significant LV dysfunction, and unexplained syncope, we suggest ICD implantation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Most patients with an ischemic cardiomyopathy and left ventricular ejection fraction &le;35 percent already qualify for an ICD based upon the results of the MADIT-II and SCD-HeFT trials. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Patients with syncope'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antiarrhythmic drugs may be used to improve quality of life in patients with frequent ventricular tachyarrhythmias leading to ICD shocks, or in those patients who are not candidates for or who decline ICD implantation. In patients who require an antiarrhythmic drug, we typically prefer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> in patients with HF and LV dysfunction due to its superior efficacy and demonstration of safety in such patients. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sotalol</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mexiletine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mexiletine</a> may be useful alternative drugs for selected patients. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Antiarrhythmic drugs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar to antiarrhythmic drugs, catheter ablation may be used as adjunctive therapy to improve quality of life in patients with frequent ventricular tachyarrhythmias leading to ICD shocks, or in those patients who are not candidates for or refuse ICD placement. Catheter ablation alone without an ICD is rarely appropriate for patients who survive cardiac arrest due to <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/VF</span> or who have VT associated with structural heart disease. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Radiofrequency ablation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of patients who receive an ICD will be treated with a beta blocker as part of the therapy for their underlying heart disease.
