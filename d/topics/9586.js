It typically occurs in otherwise healthy adolescents and is characterized by the triad of myoclonic jerks, generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS), and absence seizures (also called petit mal). Seizures characteristically occur upon awakening or in association with sleep deprivation, and patients generally respond quickly and completely to standard antiseizure drugs. Seizure frequency often lessens in adulthood but most patients require life-long antiseizure drug therapy. The underlying cause of JME is not known and there are likely complex underlying genetic defects.</p><p>The epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of JME will be reviewed here. Other epileptic syndromes of childhood are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epilepsy-syndromes-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epilepsy syndromes in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=childhood-absence-epilepsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Childhood absence epilepsy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benign-focal-epilepsies-of-childhood\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benign focal epilepsies of childhood&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Localization-related (focal) epilepsy: Causes and clinical features&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6578904\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>JME<strong> </strong>accounts for 25 to 30 percent of the idiopathic generalized epilepsies and up to 10 percent of all cases of epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Based on a population risk of epilepsy of 1 percent by age 20, the incidence of JME is estimated to be 1 in 1000 to 2000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The gender ratio in JME is generally considered to be equal, but several studies have reported a female preponderance of up to 2.9:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p>The mean age of onset is 15 years, with a range of 5 to 34 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. The majority of patients are diagnosed between the ages of 12 and 18 years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88578578\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>JME was classified as an idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) in 1989 by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In its 2010 proposal, the ILAE proposed changing the term &quot;idiopathic&quot; to &quot;genetic&quot; when applied to epilepsy syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. According to this report, JME would be included in the group of epilepsy syndromes of unknown cause with a high likelihood of complex genetic defects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ilae-classification-of-seizures-and-epilepsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ILAE classification of seizures and epilepsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The genetic mechanisms that underlie JME are not understood fully, and a polygenic or multifactorial mechanism is likely in most cases. Some JME cases are apparently sporadic, others occur in families with other IGE syndromes, and occasionally families have a pure autosomal dominant JME phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Fifteen chromosomal loci are suspected of playing a central role in JME; to date, only three are considered as putative JME-causing genes: <em>EFHC1</em>, <em>GABRA1</em>, and <em>CLCN2 </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. <em>EFHC1</em> mutations are found in up to 9 percent of classic JME patients of various ethnic backgrounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy/abstract/13-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-18</a>]. It is the only gene that has been exclusively associated with classic JME [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Seizures in JME are linked with cortical hyperexcitability, most prominent in the motor cortex, and accentuated in the mornings and by sleep deprivation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>].</p><p>Although routine MRI is typically normal in patients with JME, subtle structural and functional defects are well described using advanced imaging techniques such as diffusion tensor imaging and multivoxel morphometry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Most of these investigations suggest involvement of frontal thalamocortical circuits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy/abstract/25-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-42</a>] and dysfunction in the dopaminergic and serotoninergic neurotransmission systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy/abstract/43-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-46</a>]. In one study, longitudinal imaging in 19 patients with new-onset JME demonstrated abnormal attenuation of normal age-related decline in cortical volume compared with healthy controls over a two-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Increased cortical volume and thickness were particularly prominent in frontoparietotemporal association areas. These findings are consistent with the neuropsychological and psychiatric characteristics reported in many JME patients. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are not well understood. (See <a href=\"#H88577538\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88577538\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88578549\"><span class=\"h2\">Seizures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The typical patient with JME is a healthy young teenager with one or more of three seizure types: myoclonic jerks, generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) and absence seizures. In three large observational studies totalling over 580 patients with JME, all patients had myoclonic jerks, 85 to 100 percent had at least one GTCS, and 20 to 40 percent had absence seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy/abstract/6,7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,9</a>]. Only 5.5 percent of patients had myoclonic jerks as the only seizure type recognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Approximately one-half of patients have a family history of one or more of the three seizure types.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The hallmark seizures in JME are myoclonic jerks (or myoclonias), which are most frequent in the morning, within the first hour after awakening. Myoclonic seizures are seen as isolated jerks preferentially involving one but usually both arms, sometimes as subtle as a finger twitch. Involvement of the lower limbs leading to falls is uncommon. The myoclonus in JME is epileptic, as opposed to physiologic or essential. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-evaluation-of-myoclonus#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and evaluation of myoclonus&quot;, section on 'Clinical and etiologic classification'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">With careful history taking, nearly all patients with JME have myoclonic seizures, but almost never in isolation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GTCS occur in almost all patients with JME, often as the index event leading to diagnosis. A GTCS secondary to JME cannot be distinguished from one related to other generalized epilepsy syndromes. Focal ictal symptoms such as head version or asymmetric tonic posturing or clonic movements have been noted in 16 to 40 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy/abstract/6,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,48</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence seizures are the least common seizure type in JME, occurring in 20 to 40 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy/abstract/6,7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,9</a>]. When they do occur, they almost always precede the first myoclonic or generalized seizure, often by as much as five years. The onset of absence seizures at an earlier age may lead to a diagnosis of childhood or juvenile absence epilepsy; only a family history of myoclonus or GTCS will suggest the correct diagnosis (see <a href=\"#H88578471\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below). During video monitoring, clinical manifestations of an absence ictus can show great variation, ranging from subtle or no overt features to severe impairment of consciousness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Absence phenomenology can vary even within the same patient.</p><p/><p>Myoclonic jerks and GTCS are most common in the mornings and are aggravated by sleep deprivation, alcohol consumption, and sometimes photic stimulation.</p><p>Absence seizures typically precede the onset of myoclonic jerks and GTCS by three to five years, starting as early as age six years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Delays in diagnosis are common, often because absence seizures and myoclonic jerks go unrecognized by the patient and family until a GTCS occurs.</p><p>Rarer seizure patterns include episodes of nonconvulsive, generalized tonic-clonic, myoclonic, or mixed myoclonic-absence status epilepticus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy/abstract/50-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-53</a>]. Rare patients may have reflex seizures triggered by various types of stimuli, such as writing, reading, praxis, or higher mental activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy/abstract/23,54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,54-56</a>].</p><p>Some authors distinguish various subtypes of JMEs based on different clinical phenotypes and their evolution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy/abstract/13,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,57</a>]. These categories include classic JME (accounting for 72 percent in a series of 257 patients), childhood absence epilepsy evolving to JME (18 percent), JME with adolescent absences (7 percent), and JME with astatic (atonic, drop attack) seizures (3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2859352\"><span class=\"h2\">Cognition and behavior</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with JME have normal global cognitive capacities. However, formal neuropsychological testing demonstrates variable degrees of frontal lobe dysfunction, typically mild to moderate, on tests of verbal fluency, abstract reasoning and mental flexibility, attention, cognitive speed, and planning and organization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy/abstract/33,47,58-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,47,58-61</a>]. These results are likely influenced by multiple factors, including antiseizure drugs, seizure frequency, genetic variability, psychosocial conditions, and educational level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy/abstract/58,62-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,62-64</a>]. However, in at least one study, cognitive performance was not correlated with disease duration, seizure frequency, seizure types, or treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Advanced neuroimaging studies have suggested an underlying structural basis for these neuropsychiatric deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy/abstract/25,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,65</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H88578578\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology and genetics'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2859523\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychiatric comorbidity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with JME are at increased risk for comorbid psychiatric illness and personality disorder. Up to 50 percent of patients meet formal criteria for a psychiatric disorder (mostly anxiety or mood disorder), and 20 to 35 percent have cluster B personality traits such as impulsivity, humor reactivity, emotional instability, and difficulty accepting social rules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy/abstract/66-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-71</a>]. Poorly controlled seizures and antiseizure drugs themselves may also put patients at risk for psychiatric side effects and mood disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy/abstract/69,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,72</a>]. Functional MRI data suggest that frontal-insular network dysfunction may contributed to emotional disturbances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=comorbidities-and-complications-of-epilepsy-in-adults#H810062849\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Comorbidities and complications of epilepsy in adults&quot;, section on 'Psychiatric disorders'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63733735\"><span class=\"h1\">ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAPHY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of JME in a patient with clinical features is supported by electroencephalography (EEG).

This number increases to nearly 100 percent with overnight recording, when abnormalities are commonly seen in the transition phases from sleep to awakening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy/abstract/74,76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,76,77</a>]. For this reason, a normal EEG in a patient suspected of having JME should prompt an overnight recording.</p><p>The classic interictal EEG pattern in JME is 4 to 6 Hz bilateral polyspike and slow wave discharges with frontal predominance over a normal background activity. Less common abnormalities include 2.5 to 4.5 Hz bilateral spike-waves, single spikes, and irregular spike-wave complexes. Photosensitivity is traditionally described in one third of patients, but may be present in up to 90 percent with prolonged continuous photostimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy/abstract/78,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,79</a>].</p><p>Focal or asymmetric abnormalities may be found in more than 50 percent of recordings and do not exclude the diagnosis, nor do they predict treatment response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy/abstract/80,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,81</a>]. In a study of 266 JME patients, focal EEG abnormalities consisted of amplitude asymmetry or focal onset of generalized discharges in 45 percent, independent focal spikes or sharps in 33 percent, and asymmetric photoparoxysmal response in 16 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63733782\"><span class=\"h2\">Ictal EEG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An EEG recorded during a myoclonic seizure shows irregular 3 to 4 Hz polyspike-waves with frontocentral predominance.

The routine structural MRI in patients with JME is normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy/abstract/24,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,32</a>]. An abnormal structural MRI raises concern for an alternative diagnosis. More subtle structural and functional defects in the frontal thalamocortical circuits have been demonstrated using advanced imaging techniques. (See <a href=\"#H88578578\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology and genetics'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6578918\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Formal diagnostic criteria have not been established for JME. The diagnosis is established by a careful history, supportive clinical features and typical EEG findings. In a survey of 69 adult and pediatric epileptologists, all respondents agreed that a diagnosis of JME can be made with a history of myoclonus, a single generalized tonic-clonic seizure (GTCS), and a typical EEG pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. Most required a history of myoclonic jerks, the presence of two out of three seizure types, a normal neurological examination, and a normal background EEG pattern. The majority did not require an MRI for diagnosis. Thus, if the history and EEG findings are all consistent with the diagnosis, further studies may not be necessary. If a routine EEG is normal in a patient suspected of having JME, an overnight sleep EEG should be performed. (See <a href=\"#H63733735\" class=\"local\">'Electroencephalography'</a> above.)</p><p>The diagnosis of JME should be considered in every developmentally normal child with absence seizures beginning in the second half of the first decade and isolated generalized convulsive seizures, particularly if they occur upon awakening in the mornings. A detailed history of myoclonic jerks should be sought as this may not be volunteered.</p><p>Delays in diagnosis are frequent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy/abstract/7,86,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,86,87</a>].

Myoclonic jerks do not occur in CAE, but the two syndromes can be confused when JME starts with absence seizures prior to the onset of myoclonic jerks (as it does in up to one third of patients). However, the absence seizures in JME are typically milder and shorter compared with those of CAE and have different EEG patterns.

Interictal EEG shows unilateral or bilateral occipital spike-waves and generalized spike-waves. Myoclonic and generalized seizures are rare in IPOE but can occur, and there may be more clinical overlap between IPOE and JME than previously recognized. As an example, one study compared four families with IPOE to 40 probands with JME and noted overlapping electroclinical features, including visual auras and conscious head version in JME patients, and myoclonic jerks and GTCS without photic stimulation in IPOE patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Progressive myoclonic epilepsy &ndash; </strong>Symptomatic myoclonus is a major feature of the rare, genetically heterogeneous syndrome known as PME. The most common causes of PME are Lafora disease, myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF), neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy, and Gaucher disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. In contrast to JME, the myoclonus associated with PME is typically multifocal and induced by action or by somatosensory stimulation. PME can also be distinguished from JME by its progressive nature, greater severity of seizures, and accompanying cognitive decline.

In clinical practice, the well-demonstrated efficacy of valproate in patients with JME most often outweighs these potential side effects when this is discussed with patients and their parents, and valproate remains a first-choice therapy in a majority of girls with JME. Options for effective contraception in the setting of antiseizure drug therapy should also be reviewed when appropriate.

It is believed to have a complex underlying genetic basis; however, the exact mechanisms are not well understood. (See <a href=\"#H88578578\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology and genetics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>JME is typically diagnosed in otherwise healthy young teenagers and is characterized by one or more of the following seizure types: myoclonic jerks, absence seizures, and generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS). (See <a href=\"#H88577538\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Myoclonic jerks are the hallmark seizures in JME and often begin before the first generalized tonic clonic seizure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>GTCS occur in almost all patients, often as the index event leading to diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Absence seizures are present in 20 to 40 percent of patients beginning up to five years before other seizure types. Delays in diagnosis are common since absence seizures and myoclonic jerks often go unnoticed until a first GTCS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The classic interictal electroencephalography (EEG) pattern in JME is 4 to 6 Hz bilateral polyspike and slow wave discharges with frontal predominance over a normal background activity. Sensitivity of the EEG rises to nearly 100 percent with overnight recording. (See <a href=\"#H63733735\" class=\"local\">'Electroencephalography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of JME is established by a careful history, supportive clinical features and EEG. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is typically normal and is not required for diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H6578918\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of JME includes other idiopathic generalized epilepsies with onset in childhood and progressive myoclonic epilepsy (PME). (See <a href=\"#H88578471\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with JME, we recommend initial treatment with a broad spectrum antiseizure drug (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levetiracetam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levetiracetam</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamotrigine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topiramate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topiramate</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Valproate has the best established efficacy and results in seizure control in 80 percent of patients. Valproate should be used with caution in postpubertal girls, particularly those who are considering becoming pregnant or who cannot guarantee reliable birth control practices, because of its teratogenic risks. Patients generally respond quickly and completely to antiseizure drug therapy, but most require life-long treatment. Some patients require combination therapy after two single-agent treatment failures. Rare patients have drug-resistant epilepsy. (See <a href=\"#H6578974\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognitive, behavioral, and social difficulties may occur, either directly related to underlying cerebral dysfunction or as a result of medication side effects.
