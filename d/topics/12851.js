It is performed by the administration of sedative medications in monitored settings and is aimed at inducing a state of decreased awareness or absent awareness (unconsciousness). The intent of palliative sedation is to relieve the burden of otherwise intolerable suffering for terminally ill patients and to do so in such a manner so as to preserve the moral sensibilities of the patient, medical professionals involved in his or her care, and concerned family and friends [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-sedation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>This topic will review the indications and administration of palliative sedation in patients nearing the end of life, as well as special applications of palliative sedation in other palliative care settings, such as in emergency situations, for respite, and for psychological distress. Other aspects of symptom care in the palliative setting are covered separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-managing-common-non-pain-symptoms-in-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of managing common non-pain symptoms in palliative care&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21551878\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Palliative sedation may be utilized in both adults and children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-sedation/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>] with advanced incurable (ie, terminal) illness in order to alleviate severe symptoms that are refractory to other forms of treatment. It is most commonly utilized for the treatment of refractory pain, dyspnea, agitated delirium, and convulsions. However, there is much variability in the use definition of &ldquo;refractory&rdquo; symptoms, and thus, in the prevalence of use of palliative sedation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F88421\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88421 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-sedation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>Some emergency situations for which palliative sedation could be considered may include massive hemorrhage, asphyxiation, an overwhelming pain crisis, and severe terminal dyspnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-sedation/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H465738998\" class=\"local\">'Emergency sedation'</a> below.)</p><p>Still, other than in emergency situations, intermittent or mild sedation should generally be attempted before palliative sedation. For some patients, a state of &quot;conscious sedation&quot;, in which the ability to respond to verbal stimuli is retained, may provide adequate relief without total loss of interactive function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H973825342\"><span class=\"h2\">Defining refractory symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A symptom is considered &quot;refractory&quot; when it cannot adequately be controlled by therapies that do not seriously compromise consciousness. The diagnostic criteria for &quot;refractoriness&quot; are based on the clinician&rsquo;s determination that further invasive and noninvasive interventions meet any of the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-sedation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incapable of providing adequate relief,</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Associated with excessive and intolerable acute or chronic adverse effects, or </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unlikely to provide relief within a tolerable time frame. &#160;</p><p/><p>A refractory symptom may also be defined as one that is associated with intolerable suffering on the part of the patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H327805840\"><span class=\"h1\">CONCERNS OF STAFF AND FAMILY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Witnessing or just considering palliative sedation can be profoundly distressing to family and staff. This is particularly true if there is concern regarding the effects and ethics of palliative sedation, lingering disagreement regarding the treatment plan among providers, and in situations where the process is protracted. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11453137\"><span class=\"h2\">Are we hastening death?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple studies have attempted to measure the impact of palliative sedation on patient survival, and their overall conclusion is that survival is the same (or even better) when sedated patients are compared to non-sedated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-sedation/abstract/11-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-18</a>]. These studies, while important, share methodological limitations that detract from the certainty of their conclusions: they are all cohort studies, most did not incorporate cohort matching for prognostic factors, and many did not detail the degree of sedation in the intervention arm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H769476216\"><span class=\"h2\">Other ethical concerns</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some family members and staff may be concerned that palliative sedation is a form of euthanasia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying#H2701503383\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physician-assisted dying: Understanding, evaluating, and responding to requests for medical aid in dying&quot;, section on 'Defining and describing practices'</a>.)</p><p>The discussion of ethical issues with family and care team members should address the distinction from euthanasia. Palliative sedation is distinct from euthanasia in that euthanasia refers to the deliberate termination of the life of a patient by active intervention, usually at the request of the patient (voluntary active euthanasia [VAE]). Palliative sedation, in contrast, is utilized for refractory suffering and the intent of the intervention is to provide symptom relief, not expressly to end the life of the suffering patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-sedation/abstract/19-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-26</a>]. </p><p>Discussions with family members should emphasize that uncontrolled suffering at the end of life constitutes a critical situation and that the option of palliative sedation, after obtaining informed consent by the patient (or his or her surrogate) or by previously determined advance directives, constitutes a proportionate and effective response to suffering that is within accepted medical guidelines and supported by the principles of patient autonomy and self-determination. In this context, the decision to offer the use of sedation to relieve intolerable suffering to terminally ill patients presents no new ethical problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-sedation/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>] and is supported by legal precedent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-sedation/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H21551899\" class=\"local\">'Obtaining consent'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethical-issues-in-palliative-care#H2384350\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ethical issues in palliative care&quot;, section on 'Palliative sedation'</a>.)</p><p>Some authors assume that palliative sedation requires the concurrent discontinuation of nutrition and hydration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-sedation/abstract/32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-35</a>]. Therefore, they argue that while palliative sedation for the relief of uncontrolled symptoms may be justifiable, it almost certainly hastens death by allowing for starvation and dehydration. However, it is important to reassert that the discontinuation of hydration and nutrition is <strong>not</strong> an essential element to the administration of sedation in the management of refractory symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-sedation/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H21551927\" class=\"local\">'The role of nutrition and hydration'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H769476784\"><span class=\"h3\">Ethically problematic practices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians using palliative sedation need to be aware of the potential for harm from abusive, injudicious, or unskilled use of sedation. Potential harm is illustrated in the following examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sedation as a means of hastening death &ndash; This is the most common abuse of palliative sedation. It may occur by the deliberate use of deep sedation in patients who have no refractory symptoms, or in the deliberate use of doses that far exceed what is necessary to provide adequate comfort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-sedation/abstract/19-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-26</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sedation applied inappropriately &ndash; Palliative sedation may be used for an inappropriate indication, due to inadequate patient assessment that may have overlooked a potentially reversible cause of distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-sedation/abstract/20,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,37</a>]. For patients in whom palliative sedation is being considered, consultation with palliative care experts or a multidisciplinary team may help identify potential and available alternatives to palliative sedation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-sedation/abstract/20,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sedation given in response to the family&rsquo;s (or others&rsquo;) wishes and not in response to the patient him or herself (or <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> advance directives) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-sedation/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sedation withheld when it is appropriate &ndash; This may occur when clinicians rule out or do not offer the option of palliative sedation in favor of other therapeutic options that do not provide adequate relief. This may occur when anxiety about having to deal with all of the difficult discussions about sedation and end of life care results in continued futile therapeutic trials of ineffective therapies or when there are reservations based on undue concerns about potentially hastening death.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11453237\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to the care team</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The care team should recognize the potential for staff distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-sedation/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. All participating staff members need to understand the rationale for sedation and goals of care. Whenever possible this should be addressed at team meetings or case conferences, both before and after the event, to discuss the professional and emotional issues related to such decisions. Distress can be mitigated by fostering a culture of sensitivity to the emotional burdens involved in care, participating in the deliberative processes leading up to a treatment decision, sharing information, and engaging in multidisciplinary discussions that offer the group or individuals opportunities to express their feelings. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H327805899\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to the patient's family and friends</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Palliative sedation can be a welcomed method to assure patient comfort, but can also be profoundly distressing to the patient&rsquo;s family members <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> friends. A few principles are useful when considering the approach to a patient&rsquo;s loved ones: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They should be allowed and encouraged to be with the patient. In many situations an opportunity to say good-bye is of critical importance. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They often need repeated reassurance that other methods have been sufficiently tried <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> carefully considered but were ineffective and that sedation is unlikely to shorten the patient&rsquo;s life. The conversation should also emphasize the importance of comfort and our obligation to prevent or alleviate suffering. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They should be kept informed about the patient&rsquo;s well-being and what to expect. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The care team must provide supportive care to the members of the patient&rsquo;s family <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> friends. This includes listening to their concerns, attention to grief and <span class=\"nowrap\">physical/psychological</span> burdens, and awareness for any perceived feelings of guilt. In addition, they should be offered advice as to ways to be of help to the patient (eg, by being with, talking to, and touching the patient, providing mouth care, and managing the atmosphere of the patient&rsquo;s care).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The care team should provide regular information updates to the family including information about the patient&rsquo;s condition, degree of suffering, anticipated changes, or, when appropriate, notification that death is approaching and what can be expected in the dying process. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After the death of the patient, the family should be offered the opportunity to meet with his or her care providers to give them the opportunity to ventilate grief and to discuss any outstanding concerns that they may harbor about the care delivered in the last days of life.

The discussion of this option should include review of the aims, benefits, and risks of palliative sedation, as well as the alternatives to its use. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=discussing-goals-of-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Discussing goals of care&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, most often the discussion about palliative sedation takes place because of a symptom crisis. </p><p>Terminally ill patients suffering from severe distress should be evaluated urgently, preferably by a palliative care clinician. This evaluation is to determine whether reversible (or treatable) factors may be playing a role in the patient&rsquo;s deterioration or severe distress (eg, acute bowel obstruction, elevated intracranial pressure, or a previously undiagnosed pulmonary infection). In addition, this allows for a re-evaluation of the patient&rsquo;s prognosis, which is essential in order to allow for the discussion of appropriate therapy. </p><p>In general, if palliative sedation is under consideration, review of the case by a multidisciplinary team (eg, involving a palliative care team or such specialists as psychiatrists or pain specialists) should be conducted in order to assure that all other reasonable treatments have been provided and that palliative sedation meets the patient&rsquo;s goals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-sedation/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. When local expertise is limited, telephone consultation with experts in palliative medicine is strongly encouraged.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21551899\"><span class=\"h2\">Obtaining consent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When patients with advanced illness are at risk of intolerable suffering, physicians should approach the option of palliative sedation at a time before the patient is in a crisis situation. The discussion of this option should include review of the aims, benefits, and risks of palliative sedation, as well as the alternatives to its use.</p><p>For patients experiencing severe or refractory distress but who are still conscious, alert, and communicative, a discussion on palliative sedation should be a part of a more comprehensive conversation that includes the following: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient&rsquo;s general condition and the cause of the distress</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acknowledgment that prior treatments have not been successful </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Current prognosis, including predictions about survival</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rationale, aims, and methods available for the use of palliative sedation, including the depth of planned sedation, patient monitoring, and if appropriate, the possibility of planned weaning from sedation and even discontinuation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alternative treatment options, the likelihood that they may relieve distress, and the expected survival associated with each </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anticipated effects of sedation, including degree of reduction in consciousness levels and the estimated effects on mental activities, communication, and oral intake</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potential risks such as paradoxical agitation, delayed or inadequate relief, and the possibility of hastened death</p><p/><p>For patients who lack decisional capacity, the advance care plan of the patient should be followed. If there is no advance directive, the discussion regarding palliative sedation (including consent) must be obtained from a legally recognized proxy. When the patient is a child, parental consent is required; however, care options might be discussed in an age-appropriate manner for older children to facilitate their agreement (or assent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-sedation/abstract/6,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,43</a>].

In one prospective study, 24 of 176 patients (14 percent) receiving palliative care at home underwent palliative sedation using a stepwise administration of midazolam [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-sedation/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>], which was administered predominantly due to agitated delirium. Based on the home care team and the individual patient&rsquo;s relative's experience, the use of midazolam was felt to be effective at minimizing distress and most expressed satisfaction with the procedure. &#160;</p><p>At least in the United States, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> is rarely used outside of the hospital, and is sometimes restricted to the intensive care unit (ICU), preoperative, or preprocedure settings.

In situations in which family members or other home carers feel that they would be unable to administer emergency medications, consideration should be given to inpatient care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H465739005\"><span class=\"h2\">Respite sedation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Respite sedation refers to the transient use of sedation to relieve severe symptoms (eg, malaise, pain, agitation, and nausea) that are not necessarily refractory, to provide adequate relief before continuing with further trial of nonsedating palliative approaches. After such respite, some patients will be sufficiently rested to consider further trials of symptomatic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-sedation/abstract/49,50,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50,57</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Since the aim of respite sedation is to ultimately restore the patient to their pre-treatment state of consciousness, precautions are required to ensure patient safety and to minimize risks. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administration of the lowest effective dose of the sedative agent chosen that provides adequate comfort. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitoring routine physiological parameters. </p><p/><p>If <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a> is used, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flumazenil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flumazenil</a> should be readily available in case of inadvertent overdose. Despite these precautions, this approach is associated with significant risks (including the risk that level of consciousness may not be completely restored) that should be considered in the consent process. (See <a href=\"#H21551899\" class=\"local\">'Obtaining consent'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H465739012\"><span class=\"h2\">Use of sedation in the management of refractory existential or psychological distress</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sedation in the management of refractory psychological symptoms and existential distress is controversial and is different from the use of palliative sedation in other situations for several reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-sedation/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Due to the nature of the symptoms being addressed, it is much more difficult to establish that they are truly refractory.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The severity of distress of some symptoms may be very dynamic and idiosyncratic (ie, difficult to predict); in such cases, psychological adaptation and coping are common.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The standard treatment approaches to address severe psychological symptoms or existential distress are not intrinsically life-threatening, such as the use of psychotherapy, religious counseling, and spiritual support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-sedation/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unlike physical symptoms such as pain or dyspnea, the presence of these severe psychological symptoms or existential distress does not necessarily indicate a far advanced state of physiological deterioration. &#160; </p><p/><p>The European Association for Palliative Care (EAPC) has provided a framework for addressing the use of palliative sedation in these circumstances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-sedation/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>This approach should be reserved for patients in advanced stages of a terminal illness. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The designation of such symptoms as refractory should only be made following a period of repeated assessment by clinicians skilled in psychological care who have established a relationship with the patient and his or her family along with trials of routine approaches for anxiety, depression, and existential distress.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because of the complexity and frequently multifactorial nature of this situation, the evaluation should be made in the context of a multidisciplinary case conference, including representatives from psychiatry, chaplaincy, and ethics, as well as those providing care at the bedside. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the rare situations that this strategy is indeed appropriate and proportionate to the situation, it should be initiated on a respite basis for 6 to 24 hours with planned downward titration after a pre-agreed interval. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Only after repeated trials of respite sedation with intensive intermittent therapy have been performed should continuous sedation be considered. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21552012\"><span class=\"h1\">GUIDELINES FROM MEDICAL GROUPS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For palliative sedation to be used humanely and appropriately, appropriate attention to these processes is essential. While acknowledging that specific best practices have not been rigorously developed, procedural guidelines at the institutional level are necessary for clinicians to have a framework for decision making and implementation. This promotes and protects the interests of patients, their families, and the health care providers administering care. Sound procedural guidelines such as checklists can reduce the risk of adverse outcomes in medicine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-sedation/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>].</p><p>Representative guidelines have been developed at a national, local, and institutional level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-sedation/abstract/60,63-75\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,63-75</a>]. There are several inconsistencies throughout the positions taken by organizations on palliative sedation, most notably the timing of initiating palliative sedation, the level and pattern of sedation, whether or not existential distress is an indication, and the continuation versus discontinuation of life-sustaining therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-sedation/abstract/76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,77</a>]. Discrepancies in these areas are largely due to a number of ethical and clinical factors that make these decisions very difficult. </p><p>However, several core factors are in agreement among most position statements on palliative sedation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient must have a terminal illness where death is imminent (though the definition of imminent is variable).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The physical symptoms that the patient is experiencing are intractable and refractory to the most aggressive interventions, with no other options for treatment that would be effective within the estimated time left before expected death.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The intention of the intervention is symptom relief.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The plan of sedation and the risk-benefit profile should be made explicitly in an informed consent obtained from the patient, or if incapable, the surrogate or family prior to initiation of palliative sedation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The decision to use palliative sedation must be discussed among an interdisciplinary team, ideally led by an experienced palliative care physician.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Documentation of the informed consent and the provision of sedation must be thorough.</p><p/><p>The European Association for Palliative Care has developed a 10-item framework that addresses the key clinical issues to be considered when institutions are developing guidelines for palliative sedation in the management of refractory physical symptoms at the end of life. These are summarized in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F88429\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88429 \">table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21552026\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palliative sedation is the monitored use of sedating medications to induce a state of decreased awareness or complete unconsciousness in order to relieve the burden of otherwise intolerable suffering at the end of life. (See <a href=\"#H21551864\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palliative sedation may be utilized in both adults and children with advanced incurable (ie, terminal) illness in order to alleviate severe symptoms that are refractory to other forms of treatment. The most common symptoms include pain, dyspnea, agitated delirium, and convulsions. (See <a href=\"#H21551878\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the data are limited, compared to patients at the end of life who did not receive palliative sedation, the use of palliative sedation does not appear to shorten survival in this setting. (See <a href=\"#H11453137\" class=\"local\">'Are we hastening death?'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who are acutely suffering should be evaluated urgently, preferably by a clinician with experience and expertise in palliative care. (See <a href=\"#H1550889671\" class=\"local\">'Patient assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Irrespective of the agent selected for palliative sedation, administration initially requires dose titration to achieve adequate relief, followed by ongoing therapy to ensure maintenance of effect. In general, the level of sedation should be the least necessary to provide adequate relief of suffering. (See <a href=\"#H21551913\" class=\"local\">'Administration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients undergoing palliative sedation, monitoring should be tailored to their clinical status (see <a href=\"#H21551920\" class=\"local\">'Patient monitoring'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who are actively dying, we do not perform routine monitoring of vital signs (eg, pulse, blood pressure, and temperature). The only critical parameters for ongoing observation are those pertaining to comfort.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who are not actively dying, monitoring is reasonable, including repeat assessment of the level of sedation and routine physiological parameters such as heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The decision about artificial hydration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nutrition therapy is made independently of the decision about palliative sedation itself. (See <a href=\"#H21551927\" class=\"local\">'The role of nutrition and hydration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medications for symptom palliation used before initiating palliative sedation should be continued, unless they are ineffective or have distressing side effects. Medications that are either inconsistent with, or irrelevant to, the goal of patient comfort can generally be discontinued. (See <a href=\"#H1550889742\" class=\"local\">'Administration of previous medications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loved ones often need repeated reassurance that other methods have been sufficiently trialed but were ineffective in alleviating suffering and that palliative sedation is unlikely to shorten the patient&rsquo;s life. (See <a href=\"#H327805899\" class=\"local\">'Approach to the patient's family and friends'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The care team should recognize the potential for staff distress. All participating staff members need to understand the rationale for sedation and goals of care. Whenever possible this should be addressed at team meetings or case conferences, both before and after the event, to discuss the professional and emotional issues related to such decisions. (See <a href=\"#H11453237\" class=\"local\">'Approach to the care team'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Special applications of palliative sedation include (see <a href=\"#H616539533\" class=\"local\">'Special applications of sedation in palliative care'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The use of sedation to provide urgent relief of overwhelming symptoms in dying patients (emergency palliative sedation)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Transient use of sedation to relieve severe symptoms that are not necessarily refractory (respite palliative sedation)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The use of sedation to manage refractory psychological symptoms and existential distress is controversial but may be appropriate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palliative sedation is not synonymous with voluntary active euthanasia (VAE). VAE refers to the deliberate termination of the life of a patient by active intervention, usually at the request of the patient. Palliative sedation is not meant to be a means of hastening the patient&rsquo;s death. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physician-assisted-dying-understanding-evaluating-and-responding-to-requests-for-medical-aid-in-dying\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physician-assisted dying: Understanding, evaluating, and responding to requests for medical aid in dying&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H769476216\" class=\"local\">'Other ethical concerns'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We encourage the development of guidelines on a local level to establish criteria for the use of palliative sedation. We agree with the European Association for Palliative Care&rsquo;s 10-item framework that addresses the key clinical issues in palliative sedation for the management of refractory physical symptoms at the end of life.
