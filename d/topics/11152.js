While specific changes in cognition are frequently observed in normal aging, there is increasing evidence that some forms of cognitive impairment are recognizable as an early manifestation of dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. As the following topic review will highlight, MCI is a heterogeneous state and there remains controversy over aspects of the construct. However, the utility of this paradigm centers around the recognition that dementia is not a dichotomous state; thus, refining our understanding of the layers of transition will improve the understanding of cognitive decline and ultimately benefit patients.</p><p>This topic will review the definition of MCI and related terms, as well as the epidemiology, pathology, and clinical assessment of MCI. The prognosis and treatment of MCI and topics related to dementia, including diagnosis, treatment, risk factors, and prevention of dementia, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mild-cognitive-impairment-prognosis-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mild cognitive impairment: Prognosis and treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of dementia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-cognitive-decline-and-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for cognitive decline and dementia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of dementia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-alzheimer-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of Alzheimer disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MCI as a syndrome refers to cognitive impairment that does not meet the criteria for dementia. Several criteria for, and subtypes of, MCI have been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. These criteria and subtypes differ somewhat, although there is considerable overlap. In general, these criteria include a measurable deficit in cognition in at least one domain, in the absence of dementia or impairment in activities of daily living.</p><p>As originally constructed, the concept of MCI emphasized memory impairment and its status as a precursor state for Alzheimer disease (AD). Subsequently, it was recognized that MCI can be heterogeneous in terms of clinical presentation, etiology, prognosis, and prevalence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>], and the construct was expanded to broaden the scope of MCI to other cognitive domains, thereby extending the syndromic early detection of other dementias in their prodromal stages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. These criteria were developed as a concept relating early changes in specific cognitive domains to those areas most commonly affected in the disorders (eg, memory problems and AD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>In some respects, the diagnosis of MCI is similar to that of dementia. MCI is a syndrome between the cognitive changes of aging and dementia. Considerable judgment is required in making the distinction between impairments that are normal for the older adult population and, on the other extreme, that do not represent dementia. What constitutes impairment in daily living is different for each individual. Such distinctions draw upon clinical expertise and do not rely on psychometric testing alone. These appraisals can differ between assessors and this may account for some of the conflicting results in studies of this disorder, and while the diagnosis of dementia is similarly based on clinical judgment, most clinicians are more comfortable with making determinations of that severity. Some clinicians and investigators have challenged specific aspects of the criteria including the requirements for subjective cognitive complaints and intact activities of daily living [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Amnestic MCI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Amnestic MCI (aMCI) is often thought of as a precursor to AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. aMCI is the most common subtype, with a ratio of 2:1 compared with nonamnestic MCI (naMCI), although relative prevalence of MCI subtypes has varied among studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>Initially, MCI was used to refer to the amnestic subtype, but other subtypes have since been recognized. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Nonamnestic MCI'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Single domain </strong>&ndash; aMCI refers to those individuals with significantly impaired memory who do not meet criteria for dementia. The criteria originally outlined for MCI are understood to identify specifically this type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Memory complaint, preferably corroborated by an informant</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Objective memory impairment (for age and education)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Preserved general cognitive function</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Intact activities of daily living</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Not demented</p><p/><p>Memory impairments that qualify for MCI are generally represented by defects that are 1.5 standard deviations (SD) or more below age-corrected norms. This is not an absolute threshold, however, since individuals can experience a significant loss of memory without satisfying that criterion. Different tests of memory likely have different sensitivity and specificity, and norms are not available for all populations; this further justifies the necessity for clinical judgment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Multiple domains</strong> &ndash; Many individuals with aMCI complain only of memory loss; however, they may have additional subtle impairments in other cognitive domains that are revealed with careful neuropsychological testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/7,16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,16-18</a>]. Such persons may also manifest subtle problems with activities of daily living, but do not meet criteria for a formal diagnosis of dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The multiple domains are, by definition, only slightly impaired (ie, less than 0.5 to 1 SD below age- and education-matched normal subjects).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">These individuals often progress to meet criteria for AD dementia; in a minority of cases, the cognitive profile may simply reflect normal aging, particularly if it does not reflect a change for that individual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The prognostic utility of the multiple-domain form of aMCI remains unclear, as some studies have identified this as the highest risk category for conversion to dementia, while others have exposed instability, with some individuals returning to baseline level of function over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/7,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,19,20</a>]. Much of this variability derives from different sources of subjects (eg, specialty clinics versus population cohorts).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonamnestic MCI</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Single domain </strong>&ndash; The concept of single-domain naMCI is similar to aMCI, except that this form of MCI is characterized by a relatively isolated impairment in a single nonmemory domain, such as executive functioning, language, or visual spatial skills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Depending upon the domain, individuals with this subtype of MCI may progress to other syndromes, such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD), primary progressive aphasia, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), progressive supranuclear palsy, or corticobasal degeneration. Individuals within this group appear to be at less of a risk of conversion to dementia, although supporting evidence is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/9,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In certain disorders such as behavioral variant FTD, cognitive complaints are often preceded by significant alterations in behavior and comportment. Thus, some have proposed the concept of mild behavioral impairment as a similar paradigm to recognize an additional group with increased risk of dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Multiple domains </strong>&ndash; Patients who meet these criteria are affected in multiple domains, with a relative sparing of memory problems. The substrate of multidomain naMCI is felt to be that of degenerative disorders associated with tau, TAR DNA binding protein (TDP-43), and alpha-synuclein such as FTD and DLB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Other studies have linked MCI in multiple domains to other types of dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-vascular-dementia#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of vascular dementia&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Related terminology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are many loosely related terms that have been used to describe constructs that are similar to or perhaps even the same as MCI (eg, incipient dementia, isolated memory impairment, dementia prodrome, minimal AD, predementia AD, prodromal AD, and early AD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/1,2,5,6,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,5,6,26,27</a>]. Most of these definitions do not overlap fully with the definition of MCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>The concept of MCI perhaps reflects most closely the idea of &quot;cognitive impairment, no dementia&quot; (CIND) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, in contrast to the definition for the amnestic form of MCI, CIND relies less heavily on the presence of prominent memory deficits and includes in its definition the presence of a functional disability. In addition, CIND does not necessarily require a change in cognition, such that individuals with longstanding low levels of cognition could qualify. It is a more inclusive definition than MCI, as is reflected by its higher prevalence. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> below.)</p><p>In 2013, the construct of mild neurocognitive disorder was introduced in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Mild neurocognitive disorder is very similar to MCI as defined here, and for the clinician, the two entities are equivalent. Mild neurocognitive disorder refers to a condition involving cognitive impairment in one or more domains, often memory, with relative preservation of activities of daily living and the absence of dementia.</p><p>&quot;Age-associated memory impairment&quot; and &quot;age-associated cognitive decline&quot; (AACD) are also widely used and fairly well-known terms. However, these terms differ from MCI in that they were originally devised to define normal age-associated memory and cognitive changes in older adults as referenced to young normal adult individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/1,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,31,32</a>]. AACD was developed as a way of better defining the cognitive changes in older adult patients compared with age-adjusted norms. AACD has more recently been recognized as identifying a state of impairment similar to MCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. By contrast, MCI refers to an abnormal change in cognitive function.</p><p>Studies of &quot;preclinical AD&quot; should be distinguished from studies of MCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In MCI studies, patients meet cognitive criteria for diagnosis, and are then followed prospectively to assess for conversion to dementia. By contrast, preclinical AD refers to individuals with normal cognition who possess positive biomarkers for AD, such as a positive amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) scan or evidence of AD biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

The SNAP designation may be relevant prognostically as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

In the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, the population-based incidence of MCI in individuals over age 70 years was estimated at 5 to 6 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>Aside from advancing age, factors most consistently associated with an increased prevalence of MCI include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/4,10,44,46-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10,44,46-60</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower educational level</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vascular risk factors, including hypertension, midlife diabetes, obesity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of stroke or heart disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apolipoprotein E (<em>APOE</em>) epsilon 4 genotype</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuropsychiatric symptoms (agitation, apathy, depression, anxiety)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neuropathologic studies suggest that MCI represents an early clinical expression of age-related neurodegenerative disease. Several autopsy studies have found that individuals with MCI, as a group, have Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology that is intermediate in severity between normal controls and persons with more advanced AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/14,61-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,61-67</a>].

It is important to ascertain that this represents a change from baseline. Subjective memory complaints have been demonstrated to predict cognitive decline, even when patients appear unimpaired on testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/72-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">72-76</a>]. It is important to note, however, that difficulties with certain aspects of memory, such as recalling names, are frequently reported by normal older adult patients. Subjective reports of memory complaints can often reflect mood or affective state as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/72,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,77</a>]. Some have pointed out that subjective cognitive complaints may be an insensitive clinical criterion as well as a nonspecific one; some individuals who meet neuropsychological test criteria for MCI deny having significant memory problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>In contrast to the impaired awareness of deficits commonly present in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD), patients with MCI are often particularly troubled by their symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/74,78,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,78,79</a>].

As an example, the prospective cohort in the Religious Orders study did not exhibit an acceleration or worsening of depressive symptoms in the prodromal phase of AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]; similar results were reported in the Chicago Health and Aging project [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>].

Ideally, an informant will be available, and if not, attempts should be made to contact one. The goals are to assess the severity of memory loss and the degree, if any, of functional impairment that limits independence in daily activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Although the boundary is not always clear, functional impairment is a key indicator that distinguishes dementia from MCI.</p><p>By discussing current events involving a variety of topics, it is often possible to develop a sense of the degree of amnestic problems. Discussing premorbid and current financial competence with patients and family members can be another useful measure of cognitive status that may be particularly sensitive to early decline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. A drop-off in personal care and activities of daily living may be a later, but more specific, finding for early dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>].</p><p>A brief, comprehensive evaluation of the patient's cognitive profile should also be performed. Clinicians should not rely on historical report of subjective memory concerns alone. Examples of brief, validated cognitive assessments include the Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Kokmen Short Test of Mental Status, and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/100-103\" class=\"abstract_t\">100-103</a>].

It may also have additional value in the detection of contributing or causative depression.</p><p>Neuropsychological testing should not be used in isolation; clinical judgment is critical to diagnosing both dementia and MCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/10,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,78</a>]. There are no uniformly accepted criteria for the diagnosis of MCI using neuropsychological testing. Some suggest a 1.5 standard deviation (SD) threshold value for tests of memory impairment; others have used 1 SD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/1,4,31,104\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,31,104</a>]. These appear to be the appropriate ranges for most individuals diagnosed with MCI, but these data must be used in the context of the history of the individual. In amnestic MCI (aMCI), other cognitive domains may be impaired, but test abnormalities are generally milder and are usually within 0.5 SD of appropriate comparison groups. In multiple-domain MCI, several cognitive domains may be impaired in the 0.5 to 1.0 SD range. These ranges are not used as cutoff scores, but they provide a sense of the impairments seen in MCI.</p><p>Some rating scales are useful for characterizing the stage of impairment but are not substitutes for the clinical diagnosis of MCI. The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale and the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) are useful adjuncts for the clinician in characterizing the degree of impairment. For example, a CDR of 0.5 commonly refers to the degree of impairment between aging and mild dementia. However, patients with MCI can have a CDR rating of 0 or 0.5 due to the subtle degrees of impairment without a functional decline. Since the CDR largely involves the perceptions of the patient and an informant, judgments may vary from the clinician's impression of the degree of impairment. Similarly, with the GDS, Stages 2 and 3 can be conflated due to the patient's and informant's perception. Thus, while the scales are useful for estimating impairment, they are not adequate for the diagnosis of MCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>].</p><p>For patients who meet criteria for MCI or have persistent cognitive complaints, neuropsychological reassessment in approximately one year is recommended to monitor cognitive and functional decline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Improved performance on the examination argues against neurodegenerative disease, while declining performance supports that diagnosis, even before a threshold level for dementia has been reached [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mild-cognitive-impairment-epidemiology-pathology-and-clinical-assessment/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>].

While MRI is more sensitive than CT, lesions causing clinically significant cognitive deficits should be visible on CT. However, MRI is more reliable than CT in assessing focal patterns of atrophy, such as temporal lobe volume loss; this last finding may indicate an individual at particularly high risk of converting from MCI to dementia.
