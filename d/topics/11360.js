The presence of MEN1 is defined clinically as the occurrence of two or more primary MEN1 tumor types, or in family members of a patient with a clinical diagnosis of MEN1, the occurrence of one of the MEN1-associated tumors. Multiple parathyroid tumors causing primary hyperparathyroidism are the most common component of MEN1, occurring in nearly all patients by age 50 years, and is the initial manifestation of the disorder in most patients. In one series of 220 patients with MEN1, parathyroid, pituitary glands, and pancreatic islet cell tumors occurred in 95, 30, and 41 percent of affected patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-definition-and-genetics/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The prevalence of MEN1 is approximately 2 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-definition-and-genetics/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The incidence ranges from 1 to 18, 16 to 38, and less than 3 percent in patients with parathyroid adenomas, gastrinomas, and pituitary adenomas, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-definition-and-genetics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Patients with MEN1 may have tumors other than those in the parathyroid and pituitary, and pancreatic islet cells. The duodenum is a common site of tumors (gastrinomas) in these patients, and thymic or bronchial carcinoid tumors, enterochromaffin cell-like gastric tumors, adrenocortical adenomas, and lipomas are more frequent than in the general population. Other associated tumors include angiofibromas, angiomyolipomas, and spinal cord ependymomas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F74208\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74208 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">MEN1 gene</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The inheritance of classical multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) follows an autosomal dominant pattern, indicating that Mendelian inheritance of a single mutant gene is responsible for transmitting the tumor predisposition within a given family. In 1988, genetic linkage analysis implicated a region on the long arm of chromosome 11 (11q13) as the site of the &quot;MEN1 gene&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-definition-and-genetics/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A decade later, the critical gene in this region was identified, given the gene symbol designation <em>MEN1</em>, and its protein product termed &quot;menin&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-definition-and-genetics/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Across multiple studies, mutations in the <em>MEN1</em> gene have been detected in over 75 percent of unrelated MEN1 kindreds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-definition-and-genetics/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>], although this figure is variable across studies and is sensitive to the mode of case selection. It has been reasonably hypothesized that most typical MEN1 kindreds without detectable <em>MEN1</em> gene mutations nonetheless have inactivating mutations in the same gene but outside the coding region that is typically sequenced in diagnostic and research labs. However, as discussed below, it is clear that mutations in the <em>MEN1</em> gene are not responsible for all individuals, or even kindreds, with an MEN1 phenotype (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Other genes'</a> below). Furthermore, rare phenocopies have been reported, ie, individuals within MEN1 kindreds who were initially classified as having the syndrome when they developed a typical tumor (eg, prolactinoma) but were then proven by DNA testing to have not inherited the pathologic mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-definition-and-genetics/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Much has been learned about the biochemical and cellular functions of menin, but the precise way(s) in which these functions relate to tumorigenesis is still not well established. However, it is clear that most of the pathogenic <em>MEN1</em> gene mutations found in MEN1 patients would be expected to inactivate or disrupt menin function. Typical of a classical tumor suppressor gene, the spectrum of reported germline <em>MEN1</em> mutations occur throughout the gene and yield no strong <span class=\"nowrap\">genotype/phenotype</span> relationships. The genotype-phenotype correlations are often unclear, even within a family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-definition-and-genetics/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In addition, somatic mutations within this gene have been found in 12 to 17 percent of typical nonfamilial parathyroid adenomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-definition-and-genetics/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>] and some sporadic gastrinomas and insulinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-definition-and-genetics/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], sporadic neuroendocrine tumors of the foregut [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-definition-and-genetics/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], sporadic carcinoid tumors of the lung [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-definition-and-genetics/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], and sporadic pituitary tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-definition-and-genetics/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], further supporting the relationship between the mutations and tumorigenesis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-primary-hyperparathyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and etiology of primary hyperparathyroidism&quot;</a>). However, the large majority of non-MEN1-associated pituitary tumors, whether sporadic or familial, do not have an <em>MEN1</em> mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-definition-and-genetics/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Other genes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Syndromes clinically related to but genetically distinct from MEN1 do exist. At least one family with an unusual expression of MEN1 (eg, a lower than expected incidence of hyperparathyroidism and higher than expected incidence of pituitary tumors) was reported to have a predisposing gene at a location distinct from the chromosome 11q13 site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-definition-and-genetics/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Germline <em>AIP</em> mutation, in the absence of <em>MEN1</em> gene mutation, has been reported in the setting of pituitary plus parathyroid neoplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-definition-and-genetics/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Furthermore, mutations in the <em>MEN1</em> gene are infrequent in kindreds with familial isolated hyperparathyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-definition-and-genetics/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>] and were not found in three kindreds with familial pituitary adenoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-definition-and-genetics/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] and one with isolated familial acromegaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-definition-and-genetics/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor genes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An inherited mutation of the p27 cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor gene, <em>CDKN1B</em>, was reported in one kindred whose proband had hyperparathyroidism and acromegaly due to a growth hormone-producing pituitary tumor; the proband's father had acromegaly, and the sister had a renal angiomyolipoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-definition-and-genetics/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Germline <em>CDKN1B</em> mutation was also reported in a few other cases of MEN1 that collectively exhibited features including hyperparathyroidism, Cushing's disease, cervical carcinoid tumor, bilateral nonfunctioning adrenal masses, and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome with duodenal and pancreatic masses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-definition-and-genetics/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. MEN1-like disease caused by germline <em>CDKN1B</em> mutation has been termed MEN4 (OMIM ID #610755) and may account for 1 to 2 percent of unrelated MEN1-like cases without identifiable <em>MEN1</em> mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-definition-and-genetics/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p>Rare germline mutations in three other CDK inhibitor genes, <em>CDKN2B</em>, <em>CDKN2C</em>, and <em>CDKN1A</em>, encoding the p15, p18, and p21 proteins, respectively, have also been identified in this setting and may collectively account for another 1 to 2 percent of MEN1-like cases without detectable <em>MEN1</em> mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-definition-and-genetics/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Overall, because patients presenting with the combination of sporadic parathyroid plus pituitary tumor have a much lower yield of detectable <em>MEN1</em> mutation than in typical MEN1 kindreds or in sporadic cases of parathyroid plus pancreatic tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-definition-and-genetics/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], it seems likely that this phenotype may often be due to mutation in a gene other than <em>MEN1</em>, or possibly the coincidental presence of sporadic tumors absent any major genetic predisposition. However, as noted above, the extent to which mutation in <em>CDKN1B</em> or other CDK inhibitor genes is responsible for MEN1-like phenotypes, sporadic or familial, in the absence of <em>MEN1</em> mutation appears to be small [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-definition-and-genetics/abstract/29,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">DNA testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Direct DNA testing for <em>MEN1</em> mutation is available for clinical use, has a useful role in certain settings, and should be considered on an individual basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-definition-and-genetics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, in contrast to testing for <em>RET</em> gene mutations in MEN2, presymptomatic DNA diagnosis has not been shown to yield equally clear benefit in preventing morbidity and mortality in individuals at risk for MEN1. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'MEN1 mutational analysis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2#H6449234\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with classical multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) have often inherited one inactivated copy of the <em>MEN1</em> gene from an affected parent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-1-definition-and-genetics/abstract/5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7</a>]. The actual outgrowth of a tumor is thought to require the subsequent somatic inactivation, often by gross deletion, of the remaining normal copy of the gene in one cell (so-called &quot;two-hit&quot; effect described by Knudson). Such a parathyroid cell, as an example, would then be devoid of the <em>MEN1</em> gene's normal tumor suppressor function, and could gain a selective advantage over its neighbors, resulting in a clonal proliferation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F52594\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52594 \">figure 1</a>). The high incidence of endocrine tumors in MEN1 (which has over 90 percent penetrance) and the common multiplicity of these tumors implies that somatic inactivation of the remaining normal copy of the gene occurs at an appreciable frequency and contributes importantly to tumorigenesis in the clinically affected tissues. This model also appears to apply to some of the nonendocrine tumors that occur in patients with MEN1.</p><p>Further functional studies of the <em>MEN1</em> gene and its product are certain to shed light on these processes. In addition, the identification and analysis of other genes whose somatic alteration is also important in the emergence of clonal tumors in this syndrome should further clarify the relationship between genotype and phenotype in MEN1.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4059334921\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
