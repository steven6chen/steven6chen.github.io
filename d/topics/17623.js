However, many questions remain regarding when to initiate these costly therapies and how to balance therapy for symptoms of hemolysis with therapy for bone marrow failure.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the treatment and prognosis of PNH. The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of PNH are presented separately.

We review all available records to confirm the diagnosis and the presence or absence of an additional bone marrow disorder such as aplastic anemia (AA) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria#H5534240\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.) </p><p>If not obtained as part of the initial diagnostic evaluation, all patients should have baseline testing that includes a complete blood count (CBC) with differential, reticulocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), biochemical profile, and flow cytometry for PNH. We also obtain iron studies (serum iron, total iron binding capacity, and ferritin) and a D-dimer level. </p><p>Patients with significant pancytopenia and suspected AA or MDS should have an examination of a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, including cytogenetic studies, a fluorescence in situ hybridization panel for MDS, a quantitative CD34 cell count, and an iron stain.

However, imaging is appropriate for individuals with signs or symptoms of abdominal vein thrombosis such as abdominal pain, increasing abdominal girth, ascites, esophageal or gastric varices, or hepatosplenomegaly. Similarly, we do not do imaging for central nervous system thrombosis unless there are findings suggestive of cerebral vein thrombosis such as intractable headache or neurologic findings.

PNH clone size is evaluated using flow cytometry on red blood cells (RBCs) and granulocytes. Monitoring PNH clone size more frequently than once a year usually is not required.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymptomatic patients who have a small clone and do not have clinically significant hemolysis are generally monitored every 6 to 12 months. This includes a history for symptoms of anemia, thrombosis, smooth muscle dystonia, and hemoglobinuria; and a physical examination that focuses on these manifestations and other signs of organ involvement. The CBC, reticulocyte count, and LDH level are compared with previous values, and PNH clone size is assessed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic patients are likely to require more frequent monitoring.

Supplemental <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> (1 to 2 mg daily) is also used, as with other chronic hemolytic anemias.

(See <a href=\"#H94767889\" class=\"local\">'Anemia'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Evidence for our approach comes mostly from clinical experience; clinical trials to support many of the available interventions are lacking. An exception is the use of anti-complement therapy, for which clinical trials have shown a clear benefit in severely symptomatic patients.

Hemolysis can produce fatigue out of proportion to the hemoglobin level. Anti-complement therapy can significantly reduce most of the symptoms attributable to hemolysis, including anemia, hypercoagulability, and smooth muscle dystonia, but it does not alter the course of bone marrow failure. No other therapies have been shown in clinical trials to reduce hemolysis reliably, and glucocorticoids are ineffective.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with severe anemia (eg, hemoglobin level &lt;7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL;</span> symptoms such as dyspnea, extreme fatigue without another etiology) are treated with RBC transfusions. Monitoring and infusion are similar to patients without PNH; special modifications such as washed RBC are not needed.

Glucocorticoids may improve hemoglobin levels and reduce hemolysis is some patients, but their limited efficacy and substantial long-term toxicities reduce the appeal of this approach. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals with only mild symptoms of hemolysis may not require therapy. We manage these patients expectantly with monitoring of symptoms and laboratory testing (CBC, LDH, reticulocyte count) on a regular basis.

The antibody binds to the complement component C5 and prevents its cleavage to C5a and C5b, which is required for formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. RBCs are normally protected from MAC formation by the glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked protein CD59 on their surface; PNH RBCs lacking CD59 are susceptible to MAC formation. Eculizumab interferes with this step and thus reduces intravascular hemolysis.

The mechanism is via macrophage destruction of RBCs opsonized with C3 fragments such as C3d. Extravascular hemolysis is normally prevented by the GPI-linked protein CD55, which is also missing from PNH red cells. Binding of C3 fragments is not prevented by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eculizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eculizumab</a>; some reports suggest it may be enhanced. Thus, patients receiving eculizumab may develop (or have unmasked) extravascular hemolysis characterized by mild anemia and a positive direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test (DAT) for C3d [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].

The following considerations must be addressed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Iron and folate supplementation</strong> &ndash; Pregnancy increases iron and folate requirements, which may already be high in patients with PNH. Prenatal folate and iron should be administered to all patients. Dosing is similar to the non-PNH population. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition in pregnancy&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Transfusions</strong> &ndash; Transfusions are administered as needed for anemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thrombocytopenia. Case series have suggested that transfusion requirements may increase in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Thromboembolic risk reduction</strong> &ndash; Pregnancy increases thromboembolic risk, which is already high in PNH. Data to guide management are extremely limited, and dosing is individualized depending on the estimated risk for each patient. Prophylactic (low dose) or therapeutic (full dose) low molecular weight (LMW) heparin is often appropriate due to a history of thromboembolism or an increased thromboembolic risk, as long as there is no contraindication. Therapeutic dose (full dose) LMW may be appropriate in pregnant women not receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eculizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eculizumab</a>. We often initiate prophylactic anticoagulation during the third trimester and continue it for 6 to 12 weeks postpartum. Additional details of administration and the importance of continuing anticoagulation postpartum are discussed separately.

It is often necessary to increase the dose <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> frequency of eculizumab infusions during the third trimester because of increases in the volume of distribution, with adjustments based on clinical and laboratory parameters as described above. (See <a href=\"#H177154668\" class=\"local\">'Administration'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This approach is supported by accumulating evidence of improved maternal outcomes in women with PNH who received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eculizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eculizumab</a> during pregnancy, without additional evidence of increased fetal risks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria/abstract/36-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-39</a>]. The largest published series was an observational study of 75 pregnancies in 61 women enrolled in the PNH Registry (an industry-sponsored observational cohort) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Of these 61 women, eight (13 percent) had a history of a thromboembolic event and 31 (51 percent) had a prior pregnancy before receiving eculizumab. A new diagnosis of PNH was made during the pregnancy in nine (15 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Outcomes included the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Maternal</strong> &ndash; There were no maternal deaths. Two women had a thromboembolic event (3 percent), both occurring postpartum. An additional two of 10 women who stopped <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eculizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eculizumab</a> postpartum had a thromboembolic event. Of note, 89 percent of the women were receiving an anticoagulant in addition to eculizumab. The dose of eculizumab was increased <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the interval was shortened due to breakthrough hemolysis in 36 of 67 pregnancies that progressed to delivery (54 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Fetal</strong> &ndash; Of the 75 pregnancies in which <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eculizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eculizumab</a> was administered, 69 (92 percent) resulted in live births, representing a major improvement over the live birth rate of 39 percent in the same cohort before eculizumab therapy. There were three stillbirths (two from the same mother at 30 and 32 weeks gestation and loss of a twin in another). Premature delivery (before 37 weeks of gestation) occurred in 22 cases (29 percent); common reasons included preeclampsia, growth retardation, or planned cesarian delivery. There were six first trimester miscarriages (8 percent), which was lower than the baseline population rate. There was no evidence of teratogenicity in this very small cohort. Eculizumab was detected in 7 of 20 cord blood samples tested. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Breast milk</strong> &ndash; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eculizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Eculizumab</a> was detected in 0 of 10 of breast milk samples assayed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In contrast to this experience, case series before the availability of anti-complement therapies suggested maternal mortality rate of 8 to 20 percent, a rate of spontaneous miscarriage of up to 45 percent, and premature delivery in over half [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria/abstract/37,40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,40-42</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1895059\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral contraceptives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral contraceptives (OCs) also increase thromboembolic risk. High-quality data regarding the use of hormonal contraceptives in women with PNH are lacking. In many cases, non-hormonal forms of contraception may be preferable although there is little information to guide the choice among available options. As in all women, the potential benefits of oral contraceptives in preventing pregnancy must be weighed against the risks, including the risk of unplanned pregnancy, and compared with other contraceptive options. Options for non-hormonal contraception and lower-risk hormonal methods are discussed separately.

Surgery is also a prothrombotic risk, which may further exacerbate a hypercoagulable state from ongoing hemolysis. Patients on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eculizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eculizumab</a> should be scheduled for surgery within a week of their last dose if possible to minimize breakthrough hemolysis.

This therapy markedly reduces the risk of thrombosis, which has been the leading cause of death. Eculizumab was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2007 and authorized for marketing in Europe and Canada in 2009; thus, the impact on the natural history of the disease has not been fully determined.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2011 series of 79 consecutive patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eculizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eculizumab</a> over an eight-year period reported similar survival to age-matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2004 series (ie, in the pre-anti-complement era) of American and Japanese patients showed major differences between these two populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-paroxysmal-nocturnal-hemoglobinuria/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The mean survival for the Japanese patients was 32.1 years, compared with 19.4 years for the American population, although the Kaplan-Meier survival curves were not different for the two groups.

Asymptomatic patients who have a small clone and do not have clinically significant hemolysis are generally monitored every 6 to 12 months; symptomatic patients may require more frequent monitoring. The size of the PNH clone is evaluated annually. (See <a href=\"#H94767521\" class=\"local\">'Initial evaluation and monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PNH is a chronic disease with significant morbidity and mortality. The approach to therapy depends on the severity of symptoms and the degree of hemolysis. For patients with classical PNH, allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) and complement inhibition with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eculizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eculizumab</a> are the only established therapies. (See <a href=\"#H94769648\" class=\"local\">'Overview of approach to therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with significant disease manifestations attributable to hemolysis, including disabling fatigue, transfusion-dependence, frequent pain paroxysms, worsening renal insufficiency, thrombosis, or other end-organ complications, we recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eculizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eculizumab</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Many patients will not be able to access this therapy due to its high cost. All patients should be vaccinated against <em>Neisseria meningitidis </em>at least two weeks prior to the first dose of eculizumab, in addition to receiving daily oral antibiotic prophylaxis. Iron supplementation is not routinely used during eculizumab therapy. (See <a href=\"#H94770667\" class=\"local\">'Eculizumab'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3150318269\" class=\"local\">'Prevention and treatment of meningococcal infection'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In addition to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eculizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eculizumab</a>, we also use red blood cell (RBC) transfusions for severe anemia; supplemental iron for iron deficiency; and supplemental <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> (1 to 2 mg daily) for all patients with ongoing hemolysis.

Patients with suspected thrombosis should be evaluated promptly, and thrombosis should be treated with therapeutic anticoagulation as well as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eculizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eculizumab</a> for secondary prevention. For patients who have not had a thrombotic event, we suggest not using prophylactic anticoagulation for primary prevention (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).

Several barriers to the use of HCT necessitate its limitation to the most severely affected patients. Results from haploidentical transplants have been encouraging, and we pursue this option for patients with severe cytopenias, those whose disease response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eculizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eculizumab</a> is suboptimal, and some patients who do not have access to eculizumab.
