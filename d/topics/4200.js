Early recognition and aggressive treatment are essential.</p><p>There are two major presentations of clostridial gas gangrene: traumatic and spontaneous. Traumatic gas gangrene is most commonly caused by <em>Clostridium perfringens</em>; spontaneous gangrene is most commonly caused by <em>Clostridium septicum</em>.</p><p>Issues related to necrotizing muscle infections due to <em>Clostridium</em> species will be reviewed here. Issues related to streptococcal necrotizing myositis and infections involving the skin and fascia are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=necrotizing-soft-tissue-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Necrotizing soft tissue infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECTRUM OF CLOSTRIDIAL INFECTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Clostridium</em> species are widespread in nature due to their ability to form endospores. They are commonly found in soil and marine sediments as well as human and animal intestinal tracts. Categories of clostridial soft tissue infections include wound contamination, anaerobic cellulitis, myonecrosis (gas gangrene), and necrotizing fasciitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridial-myonecrosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wound contamination with soil containing clostridial spores or vegetative organisms may occur, although contamination with clostridial species in the absence of devitalized tissue does not necessarily lead to infection. In one study, for example, 30 to 80 percent of open traumatic wounds were contaminated with clostridial species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridial-myonecrosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anaerobic cellulitis occurs in the setting of modest quantities of devitalized tissue that support the growth of <em>C. perfringens</em> or other clostridial strains. Gas is produced locally and extends along fascial planes; bacteremia and invasion of healthy tissue (including muscle) does not occur. Mortality is low in the setting of appropriate management, including prompt removal of the devitalized tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridial-myonecrosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myonecrosis (clostridial gas gangrene) may be distinguished from the above infections by the progressive invasion and destruction of healthy muscle tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridial-myonecrosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. There are two major presentations of clostridial gas gangrene: traumatic and spontaneous.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2538563\"><span class=\"h1\">CLOSTRIDIAL MYONECROSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myonecrosis (clostridial gas gangrene) consists of progressive invasion and destruction of healthy muscle tissue. Traumatic gas gangrene is most commonly caused by <em>C. perfringens</em>; spontaneous gangrene is most commonly caused by <em>C. septicum</em>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Traumatic gas gangrene</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traumatic wounds with vascular compromise (particularly deep penetrating injuries such as knife wounds, gunshot wounds, and crush injuries) create an anaerobic environment that is ideal for proliferation of clostridia. Traumatic injury accounts for about 70 percent of gas gangrene cases, and about 80 percent of these are caused by <em>C. perfringens</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridial-myonecrosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Other pathogens include <em>C. septicum</em>, <em>C. novyi</em>, <em>C. histolyticum</em>, <em>C. bifermentans</em>, <em>C. tertium</em>, and <em>C. fallax</em>.</p><p>Gas gangrene was a common infection in the Civil War, World War I, and World War II due to delayed treatment of injuries. In modern times, evacuation to medical facilities, rapid vascular repair, and antibiotic treatment have dramatically reduced the incidence of this disease. Gas gangrene caused by <em>C. perfringens</em> continues to occur among victims of natural disasters with delayed evacuation and treatment. As an example, following an earthquake in China, the average time from injury to medical treatment was 3.5 days, and 20 percent of patients with open wounds developed gas gangrene caused by <em>C. perfringens</em>; mortality was 50 to 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridial-myonecrosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Conditions associated with traumatic gas gangrene include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bowel and biliary tract surgery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gunshot wounds, knife wounds</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compound fractures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abortion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retained placenta</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolonged rupture of the membranes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intrauterine fetal demise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intramuscular injection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Black tar heroin injection (skin popping) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridial-myonecrosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]</p><p/><p>Traumatic gas gangrene may have other microbes isolated from the site of trauma; however, clostridia are the major players in terms of destruction of tissue.</p><p>Recurrent gas gangrene due to <em>C. perfringens</em> has been described in individuals with minor trauma at sites of previous gas gangrene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridial-myonecrosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Such cases are likely attributable to the germination of residual <em>C. perfringens</em> spores, which can remain quiescent in the tissues for decades.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trauma introduces organisms (vegetative or spore forms) directly into deep tissue. If trauma compromises the blood supply, an anaerobic environment forms with low oxidation-reduction potential and acidic pH, which is optimal for growth of clostridial organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridial-myonecrosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Necrosis progresses within 24 to 36 hours of the traumatic injury.</p><p>In gas gangrene, muscle necrosis is severe, and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) are notably absent from infected tissues. This is in contrast with soft tissue infections caused by organisms such as <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, in which significant influx of PMNs localizes the infection without adjacent tissue or vascular destruction. In the setting of clostridial infection, PMNs arriving at the site of infection adhere to and accumulate along the endothelium of capillaries, small arterioles, and postcapillary venules but do not cross the vascular endothelium into infected tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridial-myonecrosis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>Many extracellular toxins are produced by <em>C. perfringens</em>; of these, alpha and theta toxins have been implicated in pathogenesis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alpha toxin is a hemolytic toxin with both phospholipase C (PLC) and sphingomyelinase activities. Two independent studies have identified alpha toxin as an essential toxin in disease. First, genetic interruption of the alpha toxin gene in <em>C. perfringens</em> rendered the organism avirulent in a mouse myonecrosis model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridial-myonecrosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Complementation of the chromosomal mutation with a recombinant plasmid carrying a wild-type gene fully restored ability to cause disease. Second, vaccination with the C-terminal domain of alpha toxin (amino acids 247 to 370) protected mice from experimental <em>C. perfringens</em> infection in part by improving tissue perfusion and restoring the tissue inflammatory response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridial-myonecrosis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Theta toxin (also known as perfringolysin O) is a member of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin family that includes streptolysin O, pneumolysin, listeriolysin, septicolysin, and others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridial-myonecrosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. These pore-forming toxins contain a conserved amino acid motif. Theta toxin appears to contribute to pathogenesis by its effects on cells of the vascular and immune systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridial-myonecrosis/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. However, theta toxin is not essential in causing mortality since isogenic mutant strains lacking an intact theta toxin structural gene (<em>pfoA</em>) remained lethal in the mouse myonecrosis model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridial-myonecrosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p>Molecular and animal studies have shown that alpha toxin is largely responsible for both the widespread tissue necrosis and the characteristic absence of tissue inflammatory response. Alpha toxin potently stimulates platelet aggregation and upregulates adherence molecules on PMN and endothelial cells. Experimental intramuscular alpha toxin injection causes a rapid, irreversible decline in muscle blood flow and concomitant ischemic necrosis of tissue due to the formation of occlusive intravascular aggregates composed of activated platelets, leukocytes, and fibrin. The perfusion deficits expand the anaerobic environment and contribute to the rapidly advancing margins of tissue destruction characteristic of clostridial gas gangrene.</p><p>In addition, large heterotypic aggregates of activated platelets and PMNs reduce the ability of PMNs to cross the endothelial cell barrier into infected tissues. These processes appear to be dependent on alpha toxin-induced activation of the platelet fibrinogen receptor, glycoprotein <span class=\"nowrap\">IIb/IIIa</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridial-myonecrosis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>], suggesting that platelet glycoprotein inhibitors (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eptifibatide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eptifibatide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abciximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abciximab</a>) may be therapeutic for maintaining tissue blood flow. Thus, the major mechanism explaining the absence of PMNs in tissue is sequestration within the adjacent vasculature. Since alpha and theta toxin also are cytotoxic to PMNs, the small numbers of PMNs that do migrate into tissue are likely destroyed quickly by these toxins.</p><p>Shock associated with gas gangrene may be attributable to both direct and indirect effects of alpha and theta toxins. Alpha toxin directly suppresses myocardial contractility and may contribute to profound hypotension via a sudden reduction in cardiac output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridial-myonecrosis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. In experimental models, theta toxin causes markedly reduced systemic vascular resistance combined with a markedly increased cardiac output (ie, &quot;warm shock&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridial-myonecrosis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. This likely occurs via induction of endogenous mediators such as prostacyclin, platelet activating factor, and other lipid autocoids that cause vasodilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridial-myonecrosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Patients with gram-negative sepsis compensate for hypotension by markedly increasing cardiac output. However, this adaptive mechanism may not be possible in the setting of shock due to <em>C. perfringens</em> given the negative inotropic effect of alpha toxin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridial-myonecrosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The roles of other endogenous mediators such as cytokines (eg, tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1, interleukin-6) and vasodilators (such as bradykinin) have not been fully elucidated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-sepsis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of sepsis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traumatic gas gangrene usually presents with sudden onset of severe pain at the site of surgery or trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridial-myonecrosis/abstract/2,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,19</a>]. The mean incubation period is less than 24 hours (range 6 hours to several days), depending on the size of the bacterial inoculum and the extent of vascular compromise. Pain is likely related to toxin-mediated ischemia.</p><p>The skin over the infected area initially may appear pale then rapidly develops a bronze appearance, followed by purple or red discoloration. The skin becomes tense and exquisitely tender. Overlying bullae may be clear, red, blue, or purple.</p><p>Signs of systemic toxicity develop rapidly including tachycardia and fever, followed by shock and multiorgan failure. In one series, shock was present in 50 percent of patients at the time of presentation to the hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridial-myonecrosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Bacteremia occurs in about 15 percent of cases and may be associated with brisk intravascular hemolysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F53404\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53404 \">picture 1</a>). One case report described a patient whose hematocrit dropped from 37 to 0 percent over a 24-hour period; despite transfusion with 10 units of packed red blood cells over four hours, the hematocrit never exceeded 7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridial-myonecrosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Both alpha and theta toxins appear to contribute to the marked intravascular hemolysis based upon studies performed with recombinant toxins in the laboratory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridial-myonecrosis/abstract/17,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=non-immune-hemolytic-anemia-due-to-systemic-disease#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Non-immune hemolytic anemia due to systemic disease&quot;, section on 'Clostridium perfringens'</a>.)</p><p>Bacteremia with <em>C. perfringens</em> can occur transiently in patients without gas gangrene, although the majority of <em>C. perfringens</em> and <em>C. septicum </em>blood isolates are associated with clinically significant infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridial-myonecrosis/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p>Additional complications of clostridial myonecrosis include jaundice, renal failure, hypotension, and liver necrosis. Renal failure is largely due to the combined effects of hypotension, hemoglobinuria, and myoglobinuria. Bacterial toxins may also exert a direct effect on renal tubular cells.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain at a site of traumatic injury together with signs of systemic toxicity and gas in the soft tissue support the diagnosis of gas gangrene. Physical evidence of crepitus in the soft tissue is the most sensitive and specific finding on clinical examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridial-myonecrosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Radiographic imaging can be especially useful for identifying gas in deep tissues. Gas within the soft tissue can be detected by radiography, computerized tomographic (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Early in the course of infection, CT and MRI are useful for determining if the infection is localized or spreading along fascial planes.</p><p>Blood (both aerobic and anaerobic bottles) and tissue cultures should be obtained; definitive diagnosis of gas gangrene requires demonstration of large gram-variable rods at the site of injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F54494\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54494 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F80492\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80492 \">picture 3</a>). Clostridia can appear both gram positive and gram negative when stained directly from infected tissues but stain as gram-positive rods when obtained from culture media [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridial-myonecrosis/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Drainage from surgical procedures is characteristically absent of frank pus, and microscopy demonstrates presence of organisms but absence of neutrophils.</p><p>Surgical exploration in the setting of traumatic gas gangrene typically demonstrates muscle that does not bleed or contract when stimulated. Muscle tissue is grossly edematous and may have reddish-blue to black discoloration. Microscopic evaluation of biopsy material invariably demonstrates organisms among degenerating muscle bundles and a characteristic absence of acute inflammatory cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F62665\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62665 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridial-myonecrosis/abstract/2,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,28</a>]. In the presence of muscle necrosis, necrosis of skin, fat, subcutaneous tissue, and fascia may also be present.</p><p>Needle aspiration or punch biopsy provides an etiologic diagnosis in at least 20 percent of cases. However, these techniques should not replace thorough surgical exploration of the infected site with retrieval of specimens for Gram stain and culture.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of traumatic gas gangrene consists of surgical debridement, antibiotic therapy, and supportive measures. Patients with trauma who have not received tetanus immunization for 10 years should receive a booster vaccine against tetanus.</p><p>Prompt, aggressive, and thorough surgical inspection and debridement of devitalized tissue are mandatory to improve survival, preserve limbs, and prevent complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridial-myonecrosis/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Initial aggressive debridement of devitalized tissue can reduce the risk of gas gangrene in contaminated deep wounds. Maintaining vascular integrity is crucial; prolonged application of tourniquets should be avoided, and traumatic wounds such as compound fractures should not be surgically closed prematurely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridial-myonecrosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Presence of foreign material in a wound site increases the risk for gangrene. In general, multiple surgical debridement procedures over the course of several days may be required. Other surgical interventions may also be warranted depending on individual circumstances (such as hysterectomy in patients with postpartum clostridial infection) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridial-myonecrosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Pending definitive etiologic diagnosis, broad-spectrum empiric antibiotic treatment is warranted to cover group A <em>Streptococcus</em>, <em>Clostridium </em>species, and mixed aerobes and anaerobes. In the setting of polymicrobial infection, <em>Clostridium </em>is presumed to be a significant pathogen. Options include either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piperacillin-and-tazobactam-sodium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piperacillin-tazobactam</a> (4.5 g intravenously every eight hours) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ticarcillin-and-clavulanate-potassium-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ticarcillin-clavulanate</a> (3.1 g intravenously every eight hours), PLUS <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> (900 mg intravenously every eight hours). Carbapenems are an acceptable alternative choice.</p><p>Definitive antibiotic therapy should consist of the combination of penicillin (3 to 4 million units intravenously every four hours) plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> (900 mg intravenously every eight hours) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a> (500 mg intravenously every six hours) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridial-myonecrosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The combination of penicillin and clindamycin appears to be the most favorable based on animal models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridial-myonecrosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]; clinical trials comparing the efficacy of these agents in humans have not been performed. For patients with penicillin allergy, clindamycin can be used alone.</p><p>The optimal duration of antibiotic treatment has not been defined in clinical trials. Antibiotics should be continued until no further debridements are needed and the patient's hemodynamic status has normalized; this duration must be tailored to individual patient circumstances.</p><p>Antibiotic agents with excellent in vitro activity against <em>C. perfringens</em> include penicillin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloramphenicol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloramphenicol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a>, and a number of cephalosporins. Studies in mice suggest that clindamycin has significantly greater activity than penicillin in experimental gas gangrene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridial-myonecrosis/abstract/29,30,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30,34,35</a>]. Other agents with greater efficacy than penicillin in experimental myonecrosis models include tetracycline, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a>, chloramphenicol, and metronidazole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridial-myonecrosis/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. The superior in vivo efficacy of clindamycin and tetracycline in these studies may be related to the ability of these agents to inhibit toxin synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridial-myonecrosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The diminished efficacy of penicillin may be related to ongoing toxin production by organisms that survive in filamentous form, due to the action of penicillin on cell wall formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridial-myonecrosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. These recommendations are in agreement with the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guidelines for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridial-myonecrosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>The use of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is controversial, largely due to the lack of data from randomized controlled trials in humans and to divergent results from studies in animals. Some nonrandomized studies have reported good results with HBO therapy when combined with antibiotics and surgical debridement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridial-myonecrosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Patients that are hemodynamically unstable may not be candidates for HBO therapy. Experimental studies in animals have failed to demonstrate therapeutic efficacy of HBO alone or the ability of HBO to enhance antibiotic efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridial-myonecrosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The absolute necessity of surgical debridement should not be delayed while pursuing HBO treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperbaric-oxygen-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperbaric oxygen therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Therapeutic strategies directed against toxin expression in vivo may be valuable adjuncts to traditional antimicrobial regimens. Antitoxin for passive immunotherapy is not available; active immunization of experimental animals with the cell-binding domain of alpha toxin is 100 percent protective against a lethal challenge with <em>C. perfringens</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridial-myonecrosis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Future treatment strategies may include attenuation of toxin-induced vascular leukostasis and resultant tissue injury by targeting endogenous proadhesive molecules and reducing duration and severity of shock via anti-cytokine molecules.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prognosis for gas gangrene of an extremity is more favorable than gas gangrene of the trunk or visceral organs, since gangrene of an extremity may be debrided more readily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridial-myonecrosis/abstract/20,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,29,30</a>]. Recurrent gas gangrene due to <em>C. perfringens</em> has been described in individuals with minor trauma at sites of previous gas gangrene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridial-myonecrosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Patients with associated bacteremia and intravascular hemolysis have the greatest likelihood of progressing to shock and death. Mortality is highest for patients in shock at the time of diagnosis. In a series of 139 patients treated with antibiotics, surgery, and hyperbaric oxygen, 67 were in shock at admission, and all deaths (27 patients) occurred in this subset; overall survival was 81 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clostridial-myonecrosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Spontaneous gas gangrene</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spontaneous gas gangrene generally occurs via hematogenous seeding of muscle with bacteria (usually <em>C. septicum</em>) from a gastrointestinal tract portal of entry. Gastrointestinal lesions are commonly known or undiagnosed adenocarcinoma of the colon. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of colorectal cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Spontaneous gas gangrene can also occur in patients who have congenital or cyclic neutropenia and among patients with prior radiation therapy to the abdomen. The diagnosis of spontaneous gas gangrene is frequently missed or delayed because it is not entertained. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p><em>C. septicum</em> has been transmitted from contaminated musculoskeletal allografts (tendons, menisci, femoral condyles) harvested from cadaveric tissues.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Traumatic wounds with vascular compromise (particularly deep penetrating injuries such as knife wounds, gunshot wounds, and crush injuries) create an anaerobic environment that is ideal for proliferation of clostridia. Most such cases are caused by <em>C. perfringens</em>. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Traumatic gas gangrene'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gas gangrene usually presents with sudden onset of severe muscle pain. Initially, the skin may appear pale and then rapidly develops a bronze appearance, followed by purple or red discoloration. The skin becomes tense and exquisitely tender and may have overlying bullae. Signs of systemic toxicity develop rapidly, including fever and tachycardia, followed by shock and multiorgan failure. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Definitive diagnosis of gas gangrene requires demonstration of large, gram-variable rods at the site of injury. Histopathology demonstrates characteristic absence of acute inflammatory cells. Gas in the soft tissue may be observed at the bedside <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiographically. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of traumatic gas gangrene consists of aggressive and thorough surgical debridement together with antibiotic therapy. We suggest the following antibiotic regimen: penicillin (3 to 4 million units intravenously every four hours) together with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> (900 mg intravenously every eight hours) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). For patients with penicillin allergy, clindamycin can be used alone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The value of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is controversial, though some nonrandomized observational studies have reported good results with HBO in combination with antibiotics and surgical debridement. However, the absolute necessity of surgical intervention should not be delayed while pursuing HBO therapy.
