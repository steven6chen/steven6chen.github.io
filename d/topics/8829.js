Issues regarding induction of labor in women who have had a previous cesarean delivery and methods of cervical ripening are reviewed separately.

These are discussed in additional topics on management of specific maternal and fetal disorders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Elective induction at 39 weeks or more</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most patients at &ge;39 weeks of gestation, we suggest avoiding elective induction of labor. The major concerns associated with elective (&quot;social&quot;) induction at full term are the potentially increased length of labor, the potential for <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/provider</span> impatience and cesarean delivery during a long latent phase, cost, and neonatal morbidity if gestational age is actually less than 39 weeks of gestation, which is the minimum gestational age that elective induction should be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-of-labor-with-oxytocin/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In the US, the Joint Commission established a new perinatal care core measure set in 2010: number of elective deliveries performed at &gt;37 and &lt;39 weeks of gestation completed, to discourage elective early term delivery.</p><p>There are, however, potential advantages to scheduled induction of labor at full term, such as reductions in stillbirth and further fetal growth leading to macrosomia and its consequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-of-labor-with-oxytocin/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. In addition, the risk of delivery en route to the hospital is reduced among patients with a history of rapid labor or who live far from the hospital. Elective induction also reduces the chance of sudden disruption of the patient's (and provider's) work and non-work related responsibilities.</p><p>Contrary to long-standing belief, a systematic review of five randomized trials found that the cesarean rate was not increased by induction at full term, whether or not the cervix is favorable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-of-labor-with-oxytocin/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Although many retrospective cohort studies of nulliparous women with vertex, singleton term pregnancies report that the rate of cesarean delivery is increased approximately two-fold in women who undergo elective or medical induction of labor compared with those who experience spontaneous labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-of-labor-with-oxytocin/abstract/8-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-15</a>], women in spontaneous labor are not an appropriate control group for these studies. Using these women as controls biases differences in cesarean rates to favor the control group because it excludes patients managed expectantly who went on to have an indicated scheduled cesarean delivery rather than spontaneous labor. When cesarean delivery rates at term (&ge;37 weeks) for electively induced nulliparous or multiparous women are compared with rates for nulliparous or multiparous women at the same gestational age managed expectantly, there is no convincing evidence that elective induction is associated with a substantial increase in rate of cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-of-labor-with-oxytocin/abstract/5,16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,16-20</a>]. The lack of increase in cesarean delivery is observed even when the cervix is unfavorable. In a secondary analysis of data from the HYPITAT trial (pregnancies complicated by hypertension) and DIGITAT trial (pregnancies complicated by fetal growth restriction), induction of labor at or near term (36 to 41 weeks) in women with a median Bishop score of 3 (range 1 to 6) was not associated with a higher rate of cesarean delivery than expectant management, and approximately 85 percent of women in both groups achieved a vaginal delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-of-labor-with-oxytocin/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Prostaglandins or a balloon catheter was used for cervical ripening.</p><p>If elective induction is performed, there is expert consensus that it should not be performed before 39 weeks of gestation. Optimal candidates are women with favorable cervixes (eg, Bishop score &ge;8) and well-dated pregnancies &ge;39 weeks, as these women are not at increased risk of long labor and iatrogenic prematurity.</p><p>More controversial is whether elective induction at &ge;39 and &lt;41 weeks of gestation (when the risks of neonatal morbidity and mortality are low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-of-labor-with-oxytocin/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]) improves neonatal outcome compared with expectant management. At present, no clinical data support this active intervention approach to childbirth. In a randomized trial including over 600 women of advanced maternal age, labor induction at 39<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">0/7ths</sup></span> to 39<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">6/7ths</span> </sup>weeks and expectant management resulted in similar rates of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes, but the trial was not adequately powered to assess differences in stillbirth and other low-frequency serious perinatal outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-of-labor-with-oxytocin/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Randomized trials with adequate statistical power are needed to evaluate maternal and neonatal risks and determine how many unexplained fetal deaths and neonatal deaths may be prevented by elective induction at term versus waiting for spontaneous labor to begin. <span class=\"nowrap\">Cost-effectiveness/cost-benefit</span> analyses are also needed to clarify the costs, advantages, and disadvantages of the two approaches.</p><p>Although some providers may consider elective induction at &ge;39 weeks for the reasons discussed above, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has stated that these are not appropriate indications for induction in the early term period (ie, at 37 or 38 weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-of-labor-with-oxytocin/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In particular, maternal anxiety or discomfort related to normal pregnancy; the distance the mother lives from the hospital; or a previous pregnancy with labor abnormalities, shoulder dystocia, or rapid labor are not appropriate indications for elective early term induction. Early term newborn infants (37<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">0/7ths</span> </sup>to 38<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">6/7ths</sup>)</span> have greater neonatal morbidity and healthcare utilization during their entire first year of life than<sup> </sup>those born at 39 to 40 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-of-labor-with-oxytocin/abstract/24-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10700886\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In each of the following settings, there is general consensus that the <span class=\"nowrap\">maternal/fetal</span> risks associated with labor and vaginal delivery, and therefore induction, are greater than the risks associated with cesarean delivery; therefore, induction of labor is contraindicated.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior classical or other high risk cesarean incision (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-the-route-of-delivery-after-cesarean-birth#H2445414913\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choosing the route of delivery after cesarean birth&quot;, section on 'Prior transfundal uterine incision'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior uterine rupture (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-the-route-of-delivery-after-cesarean-birth#H2451110039\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choosing the route of delivery after cesarean birth&quot;, section on 'Prior uterine rupture'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior transmural uterine incision entering the uterine cavity (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-in-women-with-uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids#H6625513\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy in women with uterine leiomyomas (fibroids)&quot;, section on 'Management of patients with prior myomectomy'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Active genital herpes infection (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-and-pregnancy#H14710206\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genital herpes simplex virus infection and pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Route of delivery'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Placenta previa or vasa previa (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placenta-previa-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placenta previa: Management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Velamentous umbilical cord insertion and vasa previa&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Umbilical cord prolapse or persistent funic presentation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=umbilical-cord-prolapse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Umbilical cord prolapse&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transverse fetal lie (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transverse-fetal-lie\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transverse fetal lie&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Invasive cervical cancer (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-cancer-in-pregnancy#H109748606\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical cancer in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Considerations about delivery'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Category III fetal heart rate tracing (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-intrapartum-category-i-ii-and-iii-fetal-heart-rate-tracings#H11183979\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of intrapartum category I, II, and III fetal heart rate tracings&quot;, section on 'Category III tracings: definition and management'</a>)</p><p/><p>Some clinical scenarios (eg, previous low transverse or low vertical incision for cesarean delivery, nonreactive nonstress test) may be associated with an increased risk of maternal or fetal morbidity during induction.

This system tabulates a score based upon the station of the presenting part and four characteristics of the cervix: dilatation, effacement, consistency, and position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65320\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65320 \">table 1</a>). Cervical scoring systems other than the Bishop score exist, but are rarely used for predicting labor outcome (eg, Fields system; Burnett, Caldor, and Friedman modifications of the Bishop system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-of-labor-with-oxytocin/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]).</p><p>Most evidence supports the concept that women with a high Bishop score (we use &ge;8) have a similar likelihood of vaginal delivery whether labor begins spontaneously or is induced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-of-labor-with-oxytocin/abstract/11,33,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,33,35,36</a>]. On the other hand, when the Bishop score is low (we use &le;6), induction is less likely to be successful than spontaneous labor and associated with a higher rate of cesarean delivery.</p><p>Although a high Bishop score remains useful as an objective measure of cervical ripeness and performs well for predicting likelihood of vaginal delivery, a low Bishop score does not perform as well for predicting the likelihood of cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-of-labor-with-oxytocin/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. This is because cervical ripening agents improve the likelihood of vaginal delivery in women whose Bishop score is low, the optimum thresholds for high and low Bishop score are not well-defined (high may be &ge;4 or &ge;6 or &ge;8; low may be &le;3 or &le;6), the cervical consistency component of the score is a subjective assessment, and factors other than cervical ripeness affect the likelihood of cesarean delivery. Historically, studies compared the likelihood of cesarean delivery with induction versus that with spontaneous labor whereas the true clinical decision-making comparator should be pregnancies managed expectantly. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Elective induction at 39 weeks or more'</a> above.)</p><p>Of note, a simplified Bishop scoring system appears to be as predictive as the original system.

The optimum dosing regimen for oxytocin administration is controversial and no protocol has been subjected to the scientific scrutiny necessary to demonstrate its superiority in both efficacy and safety over another. Protocols differ as to initial dose (0.5 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">milliunits/min),</span> time period between dose increments (10 to 60 minutes), and maximum dose (16 to 64 <span class=\"nowrap\">milliunits/minute)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-of-labor-with-oxytocin/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>], but success rates for varying protocols are strikingly similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-of-labor-with-oxytocin/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In a 2014 systematic review of nine randomized trials of high- versus low-dose oxytocin regimens for induction of labor, high-dose oxytocin reduced the induction to delivery interval in high-quality trials but did not decrease the frequency of cesarean delivery compared with low-dose therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-of-labor-with-oxytocin/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. High-dose regimens were associated with a higher rate of tachysystole than low-dose regimens, but maternal and perinatal complication rates were similar for both regimens.</p><p>In both low and high dose protocols, the dose is typically increased until labor progress is normal, or strong contractions occur at two- to three-minute intervals, or uterine activity reaches 200 to 250 Montevideo units (ie, the peak strength of contractions in mmHg measured by an internal monitor multiplied by their frequency per 10 minutes). There is no benefit to increasing the dose after one of these endpoints has been achieved. There is no consensus about whether the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> infusion needs to be maintained or can be <span class=\"nowrap\">lowered/discontinued</span> when a desirable labor pattern and progress have been achieved, either approach is appears to be reasonable. In a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing discontinuation of oxytocin when the active phase was reached with continuation until delivery (nine trials, n = 1538 singleton cephalic term pregnancies), discontinuation resulted in lower rates of cesarean delivery (9.3 versus 14.7 percent; relative risk [RR] 0.64, 95% CI 0.48-0.87) and tachysystole (6.2 versus 13.1 percent; RR 0.53, 95% CI 0.33-0.84) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-of-labor-with-oxytocin/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Discontinuation increased the duration of the active phase (mean difference 28 minutes, 95% CI 4-51 minutes), but the duration of the second stage was similar in both groups. Approximately 30 percent of women had oxytocin restarted because of arrest of labor. These results are provocative, but limited by small sample size, heterogeneity of oxytocin administration regimes, missing data on common safety measures, and differences in clinical definitions (eg, most but not all trials defined the active phase as &ge;5 cm cervical dilation). Based on these findings, it is reasonable for clinicians to either continue or discontinue oxytocin during the active phase, but further research to determine the best approach for oxytocin management is needed.</p><p>Although rarely used, pulsatile administration of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> at 6- to 10-minute intervals is also effective and may better simulate normal labor than continuous oxytocin administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-of-labor-with-oxytocin/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>]. Advantages of pulsatile administration include significantly lower total doses of oxytocin and less hyperstimulation. However, pulsatile administration does not reduce the rate of failed vaginal birth. The time from the start of the infusion to delivery is not shortened, and may be longer than with continuous oxytocin administration. Pulsatile oxytocin administration requires special equipment and is rarely used in contemporary obstetric practice.</p><p>There is no maximum cumulative dose limit for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H326095471\"><span class=\"h4\">Tolerance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oxytocin-induced desensitization of the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> receptor has been demonstrated in vitro, but the clinical relevance of this finding in women who receive prolonged oxytocin stimulation is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-of-labor-with-oxytocin/abstract/64-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-66</a>]. Although it has been hypothesized that stopping oxytocin if labor is not progressing and then restarting the drug several hours later will improve myometrial contractility, no clinical evidence supports this theory. Discontinuing oxytocin during labor may not allow adequate time for the myometrium to respond effectively to subsequent oxytocin stimulation, and additional factors are likely involved in myometrial contractility.

Although some studies have not observed a statistically significant increase in excessive uterine activity with concurrent use, this is likely due to the small numbers of patients in these studies, differences in methodology (eg, uterine activity was not continuously monitored), and the relatively low frequency of adverse events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/induction-of-labor-with-oxytocin/abstract/123-127\" class=\"abstract_t\">123-127</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Elective induction at 39 weeks or more'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has published a <a href=\"http://www.acog.org/Resources-And-Publications/Patient-Safety-Checklists/Scheduling-Induction-of-Labor&amp;token=Yk0OKy2CFyBWx+Q70usMXFS/KGC9vcF2X8CrFBOtdNiwq0+oqd0HnOPC2N/TO3KfEDKySuk4Px8VsFiVFbR0IMqErFHY860aQfnzNmsDkwB91PUdmT8UHhj/1CftOzCO2IfRGi2vXWY3msUbBMDQeQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=4476\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">patient safety checklist</a> to help with preinduction assessment. Our preinduction evaluation includes reviewing the estimate of gestational age, determining fetal presentation, estimating fetal size and potential for shoulder dystocia, performing a cervical examination to decide whether a cervical ripening agent is indicated, evaluating the fetal heart rate pattern to ensure that the fetus will tolerate initiation of labor, and reviewing the patient's pregnancy and medical history for risk factors for potential problems that may develop during labor and delivery (eg, risk factors for postpartum hemorrhage). (See <a href=\"#H1088274350\" class=\"local\">'Preinduction assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An induction is considered successful when it results in an uncomplicated vaginal birth within 24 hours of beginning <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a>. (See <a href=\"#H2157023758\" class=\"local\">'Definition of success'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cervical status immediately before <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> administration is a key factor for predicting the likelihood of successful induction and the Bishop score (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65320\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65320 \">table 1</a>) is the best available tool for assessing cervical status. Women with a high score (&ge;8) have a similar likelihood of vaginal delivery whether labor begins spontaneously or is induced. When the Bishop score is low (eg, &le;3 to &le;6), induction is less likely to be successful than spontaneous labor and associated with a higher rate of cesarean delivery. (See <a href=\"#H2415652634\" class=\"local\">'Bishop score'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with favorable cervixes (we use Bishop score &ge;8) undergoing induction, we suggest administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> with early amniotomy rather than amniotomy alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We use a low-dose oxytocin protocol, but other regimens are reasonable (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69023\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69023 \">table 3</a>). Oxytocin is administered intravenously by an infusion pump to allow continuous, precise control of the dose administered. A common regimen is to make a solution of 60 units oxytocin in 1000 mL crystalloid (60 milliunits in one mL) to allow the infusion pump setting <span class=\"nowrap\">(mL/hour)</span> to match the dose administered <span class=\"nowrap\">(milliunits/minute),</span> eg, a pump infusion rate of 1 mL per hour equals 1 milliunit per minute. Implementation of a standardized oxytocin induction protocol can minimize errors in oxytocin administration, as well as complications from oxytocin administration. (See <a href=\"#H89181095\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above and <a href=\"#H512030220\" class=\"local\">'Dose titration and maintenance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> regimens decrease the time from admission to vaginal delivery, but do not appear to decrease the incidence of cesarean delivery compared to low-dose therapy. High-dose regimens are associated with a higher rate of tachysystole than low-dose regimes, but no significant difference in neonatal outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H512030220\" class=\"local\">'Dose titration and maintenance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We believe it is reasonable for clinicians to either continue or discontinue <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> during the active phase, and further research is needed to determine the best approach. (See <a href=\"#H512030220\" class=\"local\">'Dose titration and maintenance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with unfavorable cervixes (we use Bishop score &le;6), preinduction cervical ripening increases the likelihood of a successful induction. We use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> 25 mcg every three to four hours administered vaginally, but several safe and effective alternatives are available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=techniques-for-ripening-the-unfavorable-cervix-prior-to-induction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Techniques for ripening the unfavorable cervix prior to induction&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common side effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> is tachysystole (&gt;5 contractions in 10 minutes, averaged over a 30-minute window. The presence or absence of associated fetal heart rate changes should also be noted. There may also be an increased risk of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Rare side effects include hyponatremia and hypotension. High doses of oxytocin should not be administered in hypotonic solutions, as this can lead to excessive water retention and dilutional hyponatremia. (See <a href=\"#H93529084\" class=\"local\">'Side effects'</a> above and <a href=\"#H77876583\" class=\"local\">'Tachysystole'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If tachysystole with fetal heart rate changes occurs, uterotonic drugs should be stopped. If there is no prompt response to discontinuation of the uterotonic and supportive measures (eg, left lateral position, intravenous fluid bolus), we administer a tocolytic, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=terbutaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">terbutaline</a> 250 mcg subcutaneously or intravenously or atosiban 6.75 mg intravenously over one minute for fetal resuscitation. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Nitroglycerin</a> 60 to 90 mcg intravenously is usually successful in recalcitrant cases. (See <a href=\"#H77876583\" class=\"local\">'Tachysystole'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women who wish to avoid medical induction, we suggest amniotomy for induction of labor as long as the vertex is well-applied (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3332548077\" class=\"local\">'Amniotomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women &ge;39 weeks of gestation who wish to hasten the onset of spontaneous labor and avoid formal induction, we offer membrane stripping. Weekly membrane stripping at term shortens the time to onset of spontaneous labor. (See <a href=\"#H2824912531\" class=\"local\">'Membrane stripping'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The average duration of the latent phase of labor is significantly longer in induced labor compared with spontaneous labor, primarily due to a higher proportion of unfavorable cervixes among women who are induced. Once induced women enter active labor (cervical dilation 6 cm), progression appears to be comparable to progression in women with spontaneous active labor, or faster. The duration of the second stage is similar in induced and spontaneous labors. Therefore, active phase and second stage protraction disorders and arrest are diagnosed and managed the same as in women in spontaneous labor. (See <a href=\"#H468254821\" class=\"local\">'Progress in induced labors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no universal standard for defining a failed induction. It is important to allow adequate time for cervical ripening (latent phase) and development of an active labor pattern before determining that an induction has failed. We agree with a United States guideline that proposed that failed induction be defined by the following criteria:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Membranes should be artificially ruptured, if safe and feasible. After rupture of membranes, the induction may be considered a failure if regular contractions and cervical change do not occur after at least 12 hours of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> administration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If membranes are intact, induction may be considered a failure if regular contractions approximately every three minutes are not generated and cervical change does not occur after at least 24 hours of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> administration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The time devoted to cervical ripening is not included when calculating the length of induction or diagnosing failed induction.
