The organism inhabits the intestinal tracts of a wide range of animal hosts, notably poultry; contamination from these sources can lead to foodborne disease. <em>Campylobacter</em> infection can also be transmitted via water-borne outbreaks and direct contact with animals or animal products.</p><p>Issues related to clinical manifestations, diagnosis and treatment of <em>Campylobacter</em> infection will be reviewed here. Issues related to microbiology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology of <em>Campylobacter</em> infection are discussed separately, as are issues related to less-common <em>Campylobacter</em> species. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-campylobacter-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology of Campylobacter infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infection-with-less-common-campylobacter-species-and-related-bacteria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infection with less common Campylobacter species and related bacteria&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features of <em>Campylobacter</em> enteritis due to <em>C. jejuni</em> and <em>C. coli</em> are clinically indistinguishable from one another and from illness due to other bacterial pathogens, such as Salmonellae or Shigellae.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2642806\"><span class=\"h2\">Adults</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mean incubation period is three days (range one to seven days) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F55054\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55054 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Early symptoms include abrupt onset of abdominal pain and diarrhea. In about one-third of cases, a prodromal period characterized by high fever accompanied by rigors, generalized aches, dizziness, and delirium is observed. It may last for one day (rarely two or three days) prior to onset of gastrointestinal symptoms. Patients presenting with prodromal symptoms tend to have more severe disease than those presenting with diarrhea.</p><p>The acute illness is characterized by cramping, periumbilical abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Patients frequently report ten or more bowel movements per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Bloody stools are observed on the second or third day of diarrhea in about 15 percent of patients; infection with an organism containing plasmid pVir may be correlated with more severe invasive disease and higher likelihood of bloody diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Abdominal pain also may occur without diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The pain may become continuous and radiate to the right iliac fossa, mimicking acute appendicitis. Nausea is common; approximately 15 to 25 percent of patients report vomiting. </p><p>Transient bacteremia may be present in the early stages of infection. In the US and Europe, bacteremia has been reported to occur in 0.1 to 1 percent of <em>Campylobacter</em> cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. Bacteremia appears to occur more frequently among immunosuppressed patients or those with other comorbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/9,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12</a>], although a surveillance study in Finland noted that 53 of 76 cases of bacteremia (70 percent) occurred in patients without any underlying disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. A mild neutrophilic leukocytosis with bandemia is common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], although mild, transient leukopenia has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Diarrhea is self-limited and lasts for a mean of seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Abdominal pain may persist after resolution of diarrhea, and weight loss of 5 kg or more may be observed. Organisms may be excreted in the feces for several weeks after clinical recovery. One study reported a mean excretion period of 38 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Chronic carriage can occur in patients with immune deficiency, although follow-up cultures are not necessary in the absence of clinical symptoms Relapse may occur in 5 to 10 percent of patients.</p><p>The case fatality rate is low and most deaths occur in the elderly or others with comorbid conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/8,12,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical manifestations in children include diarrhea, fever, abdominal pain, and vomiting. Bloody stools may be present in more than half of children. Fever tends to be pronounced in children over one year of age and convulsions may occur. In a large milk-borne outbreak of <em>Campylobacter</em> enteritis affecting 2500 children, 9 were hospitalized with grand mal seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The seizures arose prior to onset of diarrhea and their illnesses were unusually severe. Meningismus and encephalopathy have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>In infants, vomiting and bloody stools are frequently observed; abdominal pain and fever are less common than in older children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The presentation of bloody stools in the absence of diarrhea or fever can mimic intussusception. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intussusception-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intussusception in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Among neonates with <em>C. jejuni</em> infection, grossly bloody stools or fever may be the only manifestations of infection. Neonatal infection is usually acquired at the time of birth from a mother who is excreting <em>Campylobacter</em> organism in her stools (with or without a history of recent diarrhea). Nosocomial infection in neonatal nurseries has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2643607\"><span class=\"h2\">HIV coinfection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is an increased incidence of <em>Campylobacter</em> infection in patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Long-term carriage can occur, which can be associated with recurrent episodes of enteritis and bacteremia. <em>Campylobacter</em> infection in patients with HIV infection has been associated with severe, debilitating illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) may reduce the risk of <em>Campylobacter</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Unique manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with <em>Campylobacter</em> infection can present with clinical manifestations mimicking other diseases (eg, &quot;pseudoappendicitis&quot; and colitis).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Pseudoappendicitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe abdominal pain prior to onset of diarrhea can mimic acute appendicitis. In some cases, diarrhea is absent (this is most frequently observed among children aged 6 to 15 years). The pain is caused by acute ileocecitis. On clinical examination, tenderness may be observed; rebound tenderness and guarding are usually absent.</p><p>Ultrasound or computed tomography examination may be useful for differentiating bacterial ileocecitis from acute appendicitis. In one series of 533 patients with suspected acute appendicitis or appendiceal mass, 61 had ultrasonographic findings indicating enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes and mural thickening of the terminal ileum and cecum, but there was no image of the appendix [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Of these 61 patients, 41 had confirmed infection (21 with <em>Yersinia enterocolitica</em> and 15 with <em>C. jejuni</em>).</p><p>Among patients with <em>Campylobacter</em> infection who undergo appendectomy, in most cases the removed appendix shows little or no inflammation, although evidence of <em>Campylobacter</em> infection has been found in up to 3 percent of inflamed appendices removed surgically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Thus, <em>Campylobacter</em>-induced appendicitis is probably a real, though uncommon, entity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Colitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Campylobacter</em> infection usually starts in the jejunum and ileum and progresses distally to affect the cecum and colon. However, some patients present with acute colitis and bloody diarrhea, which can mimic the acute colitis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Histologic examination of the rectal or colonic mucosa in patients with <em>Campylobacter </em>colitis demonstrates acute inflammation without the chronic changes and crypt distortion usually seen in IBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p>It has been suggested that <em>Campylobacter</em> infection may play a role in the pathogenesis of IBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].

The rate of reactive arthritis is fairly low (up to 2.6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/4,40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,40-42</a>], although the prevalence of joint symptoms may be as high as 9 to 13 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. The likelihood of developing reactive arthritis following <em>C. jejuni</em> infection appears to be unrelated to the severity of diarrheal illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Reactive arthritis occurs more commonly among patients with the HLA-B27 phenotype.</p><p>Joint pain and swelling typically appear one to two weeks (or occasionally several weeks) after the onset of diarrhea.

The duration of arthritis ranges from one week to several months. The prognosis is usually good; most patients remit spontaneously or with NSAID therapy within six months of onset.

It has been estimated that 30 to 40 percent of GBS illness is attributable to <em>Campylobacter</em> infection, which typically occurs between one and two weeks before the onset of neurologic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. <em>Campylobacter</em>-associated GBS is more likely to be associated with the axonal form of GBS (as opposed to the demyelinating form). GBS occurring after infection with <em>C. jejuni</em> has a worse prognosis than other forms of GBS; recovery is slower and the likelihood of residual neurologic disability is greater than with other forms of GBS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

In the United States, about 1 in 1000 patients with <em>Campylobacter</em> enteritis develops GBS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Subclinical cases of <em>Campylobacter</em> infection can also trigger GBS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. </p><p>GBS associated with <em>C. jejuni</em> infection is likely caused by antibodies formed in response to epitopes expressed by the infecting <em>Campylobacter</em> strain that are cross-reactive to GM1 ganglioside (present in high concentrations in peripheral nerve myelin) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/53-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-55</a>]. Many <em>Campylobacter</em> strains isolated from patients with GBS belong to specific serotypes, notably Penner O19 and 041 strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-58</a>]. </p><p>The production of antibodies to GM1 ganglioside may also occur due to mechanisms other than molecular mimicry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>], and many patients with <em>Campylobacter</em> infection form these antibodies in the absence of neurologic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Some studies have suggested there may be an association between certain HLA types and the likelihood of developing GBS following <em>C. jejuni</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/35,59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,59,60</a>].

Stool culture technique consists of plating on <em>Campylobacter</em>-selective media and incubation in a gas mixture of 5 to 10 percent oxygen, 1 to 10 percent carbon dioxide, and ideally some hydrogen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F69842\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69842 \">picture 1</a>). <em>Campylobacter</em> have a characteristic appearance under the microscope, as curved rods that sometimes have a gull-wing formation when located end to end. <em>Campylobacters</em> can also take on a spiral shape. Its characteristic morphology, together with detection of oxidase and catalase positivity, is sufficient for diagnosis. </p><p>Use of culture-independent techniques, such as nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT), including reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), has been rapidly expanding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. NAATs are far more sensitive than culture, yielding rates of <em>Campylobacter</em> recovery in stool that are 20 to 40 percent higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-campylobacter-infection/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>] but have significant drawbacks. These techniques detect bacterial DNA, not viable organisms, and positive tests must therefore be interpreted with a high degree of clinical correlation. A further drawback of culture-independent techniques is that they impede outbreak detection and investigation; enhanced surveillance by using traditional cultures supplemented by molecular subtyping has resulted in the prevention of thousands of illnesses in the past. Furthermore, for the individual patient, use of culture-independent diagnostic technologies fails to provide information about antimicrobial susceptibility to guide management.

It is typically caused by <em>Campylobacter jejuni</em> or <em>Campylobacter coli</em>, and is largely a foodborne disease. The organism inhabits the intestinal tracts of a wide range of animal hosts, notably poultry; contamination from these sources can lead to foodborne disease. <em>Campylobacter</em> infection can also be transmitted via water-borne outbreaks and direct contact with animals or animal products. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mean incubation period is three days (range one to seven days) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F55054\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55054 \">figure 1</a>). Early symptoms include abrupt onset of abdominal pain and diarrhea. The acute illness is characterized by cramping periumbilical abdominal pain and diarrhea. Patients frequently report ten or more bowel movements per day. Bloody stools are observed on the second or third day of diarrhea in about 15 percent of adults; in children bloody stools may be present in more than half of cases. Diarrhea is self-limited and lasts for a mean of seven days.
