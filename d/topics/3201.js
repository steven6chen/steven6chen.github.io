Normal physiologic changes associated with pregnancy, combined with pathophysiologic processes unique to pregnancy, predispose women to develop stroke during pregnancy and the puerperium.</p><p>This topic review will focus on the relationship between pregnancy and cerebrovascular disorders. Other neurologic disorders complicating pregnancy are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurologic-disorders-complicating-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurologic disorders complicating pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnant or recently pregnant women develop stroke (incidence 11 to 34 per 100,000 deliveries) more frequently than their nonpregnant counterparts (annual incidence, 10.7 per 100,000 women of reproductive age) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrovascular-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Approximately 10 percent of strokes occur in the antepartum period, 40 percent occur proximate to delivery, and 50 percent occur postpartum and after discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrovascular-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Although data are inconsistent, the incidence of stroke during the antenatal period alone, excluding stroke during the puerperium, may be similar to the incidence in nonpregnant women of childbearing age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrovascular-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Taken together, pregnancy and the postpartum period are associated with a marked increase in the relative risk and a small increase in the absolute risk of ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage, with the highest risk during the puerperium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrovascular-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/2,5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5-9</a>]. This was illustrated in a review of female hospital discharges from central Maryland and Washington, DC in 1988 and 1991 that determined the magnitude of the effect of pregnancy (including spontaneous and induced abortions) on stroke risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrovascular-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The following observations were made:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For cerebral infarction, the relative risk was 0.7 during pregnancy (a nonsignificant difference) but increased to 8.7 in the postpartum period (within six weeks of a live birth or stillbirth).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For intracerebral hemorrhage, the adjusted relative risk was 2.5 during pregnancy but increased to 28.3 in the postpartum period.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For both types of stroke, which occurred with equal frequency, the excess risk during the postpartum period was only 8.1 strokes per 100,000 pregnancies.</p><p/><p>Similar findings were reported in a large study from France [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrovascular-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] and in an analysis from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample of all pregnancy-related discharges in the United States from 2000 to 2001 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrovascular-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Data are conflicting regarding the occurrence of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage during pregnancy, delivery, and the postpartum period. Some studies have reported an increased risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrovascular-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>], while others concluded that aneurysmal rupture is not more frequent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrovascular-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Most of the available data suggest that the risk of hemorrhage from a cerebral arteriovenous malformation is not increased during pregnancy, but the issue is controversial, and no definitive data exist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrovascular-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. One of the better studies was a retrospective analysis of 451 women with a brain arteriovenous malformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrovascular-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The hemorrhage rate in pregnant women in this population was not significantly different compared with the rate for nonpregnant women (3.5 versus 3.1 percent per person-year). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for stroke related to pregnancy include cesarean delivery, pregnancy-induced hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrovascular-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], postpartum infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrovascular-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], and possibly multiple gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrovascular-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], although the latter has not been evaluated as an independent risk factor.</p><p>In addition, several conditions that are unique to pregnancy can present as either a stroke or a stroke-like event. These include <span class=\"nowrap\">preeclampsia/eclampsia,</span> postpartum cerebral angiopathy, and gestational trophoblastic disease. Amniotic fluid embolism is an important cause of pregnancy-related morbidity and mortality, but is thought to be a rare cause of focal cerebral ischemia in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrovascular-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amniotic-fluid-embolism-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Amniotic fluid embolism syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The risk factors for stroke in pregnancy also include the risk factors for nonpregnant patients, such as hypertension, smoking, arterial disease, certain types of heart disease, hyperlipidemia, thrombophilia, infection, paradoxical emboli, and substance abuse. Age over 35, migraine with aura, and black race are additional risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrovascular-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/2,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,19</a>]. Mothers with sickle cell disease are also at increased risk for thromboembolic events, including acute stroke. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-in-women-with-sickle-cell-disease#H18429428\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregnancy in women with sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'SCD course during pregnancy'</a>.)</p><p>The risk factors are similar for pregnancy-related intracerebral hemorrhage. In a study that examined a 10-year representative sample of the entire United States obstetrical population, involving nearly seven million deliveries, 423 women had pregnancy-related intracerebral hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrovascular-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Independent risk factors for intracerebral hemorrhage in this population were advanced maternal age, black race, preexisting and gestational hypertension, <span class=\"nowrap\">preeclampsia/eclampsia,</span> preexisting hypertension superimposed on <span class=\"nowrap\">preeclampsia/eclampsia,</span> coagulopathy, and tobacco abuse.</p><p>The risk of stroke in women with <span class=\"nowrap\">preeclampsia/eclampsia</span> is discussed in detail separately.

However, the major causes are the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrovascular-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemorrhagic stroke from aneurysms, arteriovenous malformations, and <span class=\"nowrap\">preeclampsia/eclampsia</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ischemic stroke from cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, <span class=\"nowrap\">preeclampsia/eclampsia,</span> and cardioembolism related to valvular heart disease</p><p/><p>In pregnant patients, ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and cerebral venous thrombosis have clinical features similar to those occurring in nonpregnant patients. In contrast, the syndromes of preeclampsia, eclampsia, and HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets) are unique to pregnancy and the postpartum period. There are also several rare causes of stroke that are seen exclusively or predominantly in pregnancy and the puerperium such as trophoblastic embolism, amniotic fluid embolism, and air embolism.</p><p>Changes in cardiovascular hemodynamics, coagulation factors, hemoconcentration, endothelial dysfunction and inflammation, and impaired cerebrovascular tone (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">preeclampsia/eclampsia,</span> reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome) are some of the important physiologic and pathophysiologic changes that render pregnant women to be at increased risk for <span class=\"nowrap\">ischemic/thrombotic</span> and hemorrhagic strokes.</p><p>Etiologies with particular relevance to pregnancy are briefly reviewed in the following sections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Preeclampsia, eclampsia, and HELLP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The syndromes of severe preeclampsia, eclampsia, and HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets) are among the most common causes of both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrovascular-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/5,6,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,21,22</a>]. However, the most frequent cerebrovascular disturbance associated with preeclampsia, eclampsia, and HELLP syndrome is a reversible encephalopathy that is similar if not identical to that which occurs in hypertensive encephalopathy and reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome. The presumed mechanism is impairment of cerebrovascular autoregulation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reversible-posterior-leukoencephalopathy-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Neurologic manifestations of the reversible encephalopathy associated with severe preeclampsia, eclampsia, and HELLP syndrome may include headache, blurred vision, scotomata, cortical blindness, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Untreated cases may progress to coma. Neuroimaging often shows vasogenic edema in subcortical white matter, predominantly in the parietal and occipital lobes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eclampsia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eclampsia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hellp-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;HELLP syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The available data regarding ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke associated with severe <span class=\"nowrap\">preeclampsia/eclampsia/HELLP</span> are limited to retrospective studies with small numbers of patients. The following observations illustrate the range of findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a report from Mexico of 240 women with pregnancy-related cerebrovascular complications, <span class=\"nowrap\">preeclampsia/eclampsia</span> was commonly associated with both ischemic stroke of arterial origin (23 of 64 cases [36 percent]) and intracerebral hemorrhage (22 of 40 cases [55 percent]) but less frequently with cerebral venous thrombosis (13 of 136 cases [10 percent]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrovascular-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a review from Maryland of 31 pregnancy-related strokes, the major causes of cerebral infarction (n = 17) were severe preeclampsia or eclampsia (n = 4), primary central nervous system vasculopathy (n = 2), and conditions such as carotid dissection and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrovascular-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. No specific cause was identified in six patients. The major causes of intracerebral hemorrhage (n = 14) were arteriovenous malformation (n = 3), severe preeclampsia or eclampsia (n = 2), cocaine use (n = 2), and primary central nervous system vasculopathy (n = 1); no cause was identified in four. Thus, severe <span class=\"nowrap\">preeclampsia/eclampsia</span> accounted for 24 percent of infarctions and 14 percent of hemorrhages.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study from France of 31 pregnancy-related strokes, eclampsia accounted for 47 percent of infarctions and 44 percent of hemorrhages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrovascular-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p>The clinical characteristics of patients with stroke in association with severe <span class=\"nowrap\">preeclampsia/eclampsia/HELLP</span> were illustrated in a review of 28 such patients with a mean age of 30 years (range 14 to 42 years) who were otherwise free of risk factors for stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrovascular-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Seven of the patients were ascertained from hospital medical records, while the other 21 were derived from forensic sources. Major findings from this retrospective series were as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the 27 patients who had intracranial imaging, the type of stroke was hemorrhagic-arterial in 25 (93 percent) and thrombotic-arterial in 2 (7 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There were more strokes in the postpartum than antepartum period (16 versus 12 [57 versus 43 percent])</p><p/><p>Since the majority of the cases reported were derived from forensic sources, these findings may not be representative of the risks to the overall population of pregnant women with severe <span class=\"nowrap\">preeclampsia/eclampsia/HELLP</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrovascular-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Preeclampsia, eclampsia, and HELLP syndrome are discussed in detail elsewhere.

Although some studies distinguish between TTP and HUS, the presenting features are similar in most patients: microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia without another apparent cause and, in many patients, neurologic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> renal abnormalities. Neurologic manifestations can include coma, confusion, seizure, transient ischemic attack, stroke, reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome, and headache.

The distinction between TTP, HUS, and severe preeclampsia or HELLP is important for therapeutic and prognostic reasons. However, the clinical and histologic features are so similar that establishing the correct diagnosis is often difficult; furthermore, these disorders may occur concurrently.

Other entities encompassed by RCVS include idiopathic thunderclap headache with vasospasm, benign angiopathy of the central nervous system, migrainous vasospasm, Call-Fleming syndrome, and drug-induced cerebral vasoconstriction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-thunderclap-headache#H58555038\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with thunderclap headache&quot;, section on 'Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndromes'</a>.)</p><p>Postpartum angiopathy usually presents with severe headache and neurologic findings that can include visual disturbance, hemiplegia, dysarthria, aphasia, numbness, ataxia, seizure, and encephalopathy, often in combination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrovascular-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Vasogenic brain edema, intraparenchymal hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, ischemic stroke (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F77149\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77149 \">image 1</a>) and even death have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrovascular-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Blood pressure may be normal or elevated. Smooth narrowing of multiple segments of intracranial arteries is seen on cerebral angiography and can be seen on magnetic resonance angiography or computed tomographic angiography (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F64318\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64318 \">image 2</a>), although these noninvasive studies may not be able to adequately image smaller arterioles that are typically involved. In addition, cerebral angiography may be normal early in the clinical course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrovascular-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The angiographic changes are reversible, but may persist for days to months.</p><p>Laboratory testing is usually normal. Cerebrospinal fluid findings are typically without abnormalities, but may show cells and elevated protein, especially if the test is done long after the onset of the clinical findings. It is important to determine if any drugs capable of causing vascular spasm have been used. Some reports suggest that sympathomimetic drugs may increase the risk of postpartum angiopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrovascular-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>The available retrospective studies are inconsistent regarding the frequency of preceding pregnancy complications (eg, eclampsia or gestational diabetes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrovascular-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/24,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26</a>]. However, the clinical, laboratory, and neuroimaging features of postpartum angiopathy and eclampsia are not strictly separated, suggesting these entities may represent different clinical expressions of the same underlying pregnancy-related disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrovascular-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. In one retrospective series that reported 18 patients with postpartum angiopathy from three tertiary care centers, pregnancy was complicated by preeclampsia or eclampsia in 7 (39 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrovascular-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The differential diagnosis of postpartum angiopathy and RCVS includes isolated or primary angiitis of the central nervous system. Findings that favor vasculitis rather than this noninflammatory vasculopathy associated with pregnancy include an insidious onset of dull headache, stepwise addition of findings, spinal fluid abnormalities, and more distal intracranial blood vessels affected on angiography.

Some cases have been linked to thrombophilias, inherited and acquired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrovascular-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Other risk factors include cesarean delivery, hypertension, and infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inherited-thrombophilias-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inherited thrombophilias in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Clinical manifestations consist of headache, vomiting, focal or generalized seizure, confusion, blurred vision, focal neurologic deficits, and altered consciousness. The headache frequently precedes other symptoms, is diffuse, and often severe. The severity of symptoms correlates with the degree of thrombosis and the vessel involved.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-assessment-and-management-of-acute-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial assessment and management of acute stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An imaging study of the brain is an essential component of the evaluation, regardless of cause. Noncontrast head CT is typically the first diagnostic study in patients with suspected stroke. The main advantages of CT are widespread access and speed of acquisition. However, MRI is safe during pregnancy.

(See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of preeclampsia, eclampsia, and HELLP'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who have had the cause of their cerebral hemorrhage treated (eg, clipping or embolization of a cerebral aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation) may undergo labor and delivery. However, there is considerable controversy regarding management of labor and delivery with ruptured aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations that have not been definitively treated. The two major alternatives are (1) prophylactic cesarean delivery and (2) regional anesthesia with instrumental delivery to eliminate cerebral hemodynamic fluctuations associated with pain and the Valsalva maneuver.</p><p>There are no data from large series or randomized trials, but it appears that maternal and fetal mortality rates are the same with both methods. As a result, cesarean delivery should be reserved for the usual obstetrical indications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrovascular-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Aneurysm rupture has occurred during elective cesarean birth; thus it is not completely protective. Therefore, regardless of the mode of delivery, it is important to control hypertension and minimize fluctuations in blood pressure.</p><p>Some experts believe that selected patients who are stable after intracranial hemorrhage can be managed supportively until the pregnancy is taken to term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrovascular-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. The lesion can then be treated by surgical or endovascular means after delivery. However, emergency surgery is indicated if there is neurologic deterioration caused by recurrent bleeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT ISSUES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Anticoagulation during pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Issues related to anticoagulation in pregnant women, including recommendations from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) regarding appropriate anticoagulation regimens, are briefly reviewed here and discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-anticoagulants-during-pregnancy-and-postpartum\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of anticoagulants during pregnancy and postpartum&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Definitive recommendations for anticoagulant therapy for stroke during pregnancy are difficult because of a lack of critical studies. In theory, anticoagulation can be given to prevent recurrent thrombosis in hypercoagulable states and to treat cerebral venous thrombosis. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Secondary prevention of ischemic stroke'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis'</a> above.)</p><p>While there are no randomized controlled trials or epidemiologic studies to guide the duration of anticoagulant therapy, many patients will require anticoagulation throughout the pregnancy and the postpartum period, after which re-evaluation of the need for treatment can take place. We typically reinitiate <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) 4 to 6 hours after vaginal delivery or 6 to 12 hours after Cesarean delivery, unless there was significant intraoperative or postpartum bleeding.</p><p>The 2012 ACCP guidelines recommend LMWH instead of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> for the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism during pregnancy, and recommend LMWH instead of vitamin K antagonist treatment antenatally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrovascular-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. The ACCP guidelines further suggest that anticoagulant therapy be continued for at least six weeks postpartum, and for a minimum total duration of three months, for pregnant women with acute venous thromboembolism.</p><p>The ACCP guidelines recommend discontinuation of LMWH or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> at least 24 hours before induction of labor, cesarean section, or expected time of neuraxial anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrovascular-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Other approaches to the management of anticoagulation and neuraxial analgesia are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adverse-effects-of-neuraxial-analgesia-and-anesthesia-for-obstetrics#H51358722\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adverse effects of neuraxial analgesia and anesthesia for obstetrics&quot;, section on 'Neuraxial analgesia and the anticoagulated patient'</a>.)</p><p>Concerns related to the different types of anticoagulants can be summarized as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Warfarin</a> is potentially teratogenic when given between the sixth and ninth weeks of gestation. In addition, when given in the second and third trimesters, warfarin can lead to central nervous system abnormalities that are thought to be due to repeated cerebral microhemorrhages.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heparin does not cross the placenta and therefore is not teratogenic and does not anticoagulate the fetus. Concerns with heparin therapy include the relative difficulty of maintaining a stable therapeutic response, the inconvenience of parenteral administration, and the complications of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and bone demineralization, which can lead to fractures in patients treated for more than six months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low molecular weight heparin does not cross the placenta and, compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a>, has the advantages of producing a more predictable anticoagulant response to fixed doses administered once or twice daily and is less likely to produce thrombocytopenia or, possibly, bone demineralization.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Stroke remote from term</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When stroke occurs in a pregnant woman who is &lt;24 weeks of gestation, the stroke should be managed as dictated by the patient's clinical condition. Every effort should be made to protect the salvageable brain tissue, prevent medical complications (eg, aspiration), control maternal physiologic factors that may worsen the stroke, such as blood pressure, and facilitate long term physical rehabilitation. Pregnancy termination is an option if thrombolytic therapy is being considered.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, some women with ischemic stroke or cerebral venous sinus thrombosis will require anticoagulation throughout the pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Anticoagulation during pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Stroke near term</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women who have a stroke between 24 and 32 weeks gestation, antenatal glucocorticoids can be administered to accelerate fetal lung maturation. A multidisciplinary approach in consultation with neurology, neurosurgery, anesthesia, neonatology, and perinatology should take place to stabilize the mother and assess fetal status. As long as maternal and fetal well-being are not deteriorating, plans can be made to continue the pregnancy with a scheduled controlled delivery between 34 to 39 weeks gestation to optimize fetal outcome.</p><p>For pregnant women diagnosed with ischemic stroke or cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, anticoagulation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a>, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), or antiplatelet therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> should be considered in consultation with neurologists throughout the remainder of the pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Anticoagulation during pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p>After 36 weeks of pregnancy, LMWH can be changed over to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> until a scheduled labor induction at 39 weeks can take place, and LMWH can resume in the postpartum period. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Aspirin</a> should be stopped within one or two weeks of a planned delivery (ie, induction of labor or cesarean delivery).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Breastfeeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A small fraction of iodinated or gadolinium contrast agents is secreted in maternal milk. Based upon these data, women who require neurovascular imaging should discontinue breast-feeding for 24 hours after receiving intravenous contrast media and discard milk expressed during that interval before resuming normal breastfeeding.</p><p>There are no contraindications to breastfeeding while being treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> or low molecular weight heparin. Similarly, nursing mothers can safely take <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> because there is no convincing evidence that warfarin exerts an anticoagulant effect on the breast-fed infant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">FUTURE PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When counseling women with a prior history of stroke, it is important to obtain a detailed history of the etiology of and the circumstances surrounding the stroke to determine the stroke type <span class=\"nowrap\">(ischemic/thrombotic</span> or hemorrhagic) and underlying mechanism. This classification will help to guide management for the impending pregnancy. Consultation with a neurologist, hematologist, or neurosurgeon may also be indicated prior to attempting conception to optimize pregnancy outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Stroke risk in future pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most women with prior stroke during pregnancy, the recurrence rate during a subsequent pregnancy and postpartum period is low (&le;1 percent), particularly if any causative vascular lesions have been repaired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrovascular-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/33,68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,68,69</a>]. However, data are sparse, and the risk in future pregnancies varies depending upon the cause of the initial stroke.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of recurrent ischemic stroke is low. This was illustrated in a review of 441 women with a history of ischemic stroke (373 with arterial ischemic stroke and 68 with cerebral venous thrombosis); during a mean follow-up of five years, there were 13 recurrent arterial ischemic strokes and no recurrences of cerebral venous thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrovascular-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. The overall risk of recurrence was 1 percent at one year and 2.3 percent at five years. The risk of recurrence during pregnancy or the puerperium was 1.8 percent (not significantly different from outside pregnancy), but the relative risk of recurrence was significantly higher during the postpartum period (risk ratio 9.7, 95 % CI 1.2-78.9). The outcome of the 187 subsequent pregnancies was similar to that expected from the general population. The authors concluded that a previous ischemic stroke is not a contraindication to a subsequent pregnancy.<br/><br/>After addressing any underlying medical disorders, low dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and low molecular weight heparin can be considered in women with prior history of <span class=\"nowrap\">ischemic/thrombotic</span> stroke for empiric prophylaxis against future thrombotic stroke during future pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrovascular-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Few studies have examined recurrence after pregnancy-related stroke associated with hypercoagulable states. The largest evaluated 12 women with a previous cerebrovascular event (infarction, transient ischemic attack [TIA], or amaurosis fugax) in the setting of thrombophilia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrovascular-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. In 15 subsequent pregnancies, there were four thromboembolic events, including two amaurosis fugax, one TIA, and one cerebral infarction. None of the patients had persistent neurologic deficits.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are insufficient data to assess the risk of recurrent cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVT), and the role of antithrombotic prophylaxis during subsequent pregnancies is unproven in women with a history of CVT. There is no consensus regarding this issue. Many experts believe that antithrombotic prophylaxis during pregnancy is probably unnecessary unless a prothrombotic condition or a previous thromboembolism (ie, a previous CVT or deep venous thrombosis before the index CVT) has been identified. However, other experts would prefer to treat with intravenous heparin or subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin during the late third trimester <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> up to eight weeks postpartum. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cerebral-venous-thrombosis-treatment-and-prognosis#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cerebral venous thrombosis: Treatment and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Subsequent pregnancy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Untreated vascular malformations are prone to rebleeding whether or not the patient becomes pregnant. In one study, the annual rate of recurrent hemorrhage in women with a brain arteriovenous malformation was estimated to be 31 percent in the first year following an initial hemorrhage and 6 percent in subsequent years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebrovascular-disorders-complicating-pregnancy/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Therefore, vascular malformations should be definitively treated by surgical excision or endovascular embolization in women before reattempting pregnancy, if possible.
