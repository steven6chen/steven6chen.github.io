This is best accomplished by performing a thorough evaluation, and by listening to them, validating that their pain is &quot;real,&quot; offering explanations and reassurance, and making a commitment to try to help [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Most patients are able to understand that there are no &quot;magic bullets&quot; or instant cures and are satisfied with the knowledge that their physicians will make an honest effort to help them in a gradual and stepwise fashion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Usually the history and physical examination suggest one or more diagnoses or disorders (&quot;pain generators&quot;) that seem to cause or exacerbate CPP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F58699\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58699 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of chronic pelvic pain in women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of chronic pelvic pain in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p>To decide on the best therapeutic plan for an individual patient, the physician and patient should have a thorough discussion of her preferences and values regarding testing, medical versus surgical treatment, and childbearing plans. For many patients, the optimal approach involves a combination of treatments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Empiric trial of therapy based on diagnostic probabilities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One approach to managing women with CPP is to prescribe sequential drug treatments for disorders that are the most likely causes of the patient's CPP. As an example, endometriosis is the most common gynecological cause of CPP. If endometriosis seems a likely diagnosis based upon the history and physical examination, then a medical therapy for endometriosis is given for a trial period (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Endometriosis'</a> below). If this is not successful, then a trial of another medical therapy is initiated. If one of these treatments relieves the pelvic pain, then the likelihood that endometriosis is the cause of CPP increases. However, it is important to note that improvement in symptoms is not absolute confirmation of a diagnosis since treatment effects are often not specific. As an example, hormonal treatment of endometriosis may also improve pelvic congestion syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, or interstitial <span class=\"nowrap\">cystitis/painful</span> bladder syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Intensive diagnostic evaluation followed by targeted therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A different approach is to use intensive diagnostic testing in an attempt to identify the specific cause of the patient's CPP, if possible, before starting specific therapy. Although therapy targeted specifically to the patient's diagnosis might appear ideal, arriving at a diagnosis may involve costly laboratory and imaging tests, and often requires exploratory surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonspecific analgesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A third option is treatment directed at pain, rather than at a specific diagnosis.

As discussed above, a satisfactory response to empiric treatment cannot be construed as definitive confirmation or exclusion of the diagnosis of endometriosis. Definitive diagnosis requires histological confirmation of ectopic endometrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>First line agents employed sequentially include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) prescribed at maximal doses (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> 800 mg orally every eight hours).

This conclusion was supported by the following randomized controlled trials:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one trial, 48 women with CPP were randomly assigned to surgical adhesiolysis of abdominopelvic adhesions or expectant management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Prior to randomization, all women had a laparoscopy procedure to stage the severity of the adhesions using the criteria of Kapur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Pain was assessed using the McGill pain questionnaire [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Women with previous malignant pelvic disease, hormonal treatment for pelvic pain, or psychiatric treatment during the previous two years were excluded.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">One year later, approximately 50 percent of women in both groups reported improvement in their pain. However, a post-hoc analysis revealed that women with dense vascularized adhesions involving the bowel and peritoneum had a significantly greater degree of pain relief with adhesiolysis than with expectant management.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lack of benefit of adhesiolysis was confirmed in another trial in which 100 patients with laparoscopically documented adhesions and chronic abdominal (not pelvic) pain were randomly assigned at the time of diagnostic laparoscopy to either adhesiolysis or no adhesiolysis (controls) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Patients were not told of their assignment until the study was over, 12 months after the surgical procedure. Assessors unaware of the patient's allocation evaluated pain using a visual analogue score (VAS) score (scale 0 to 100), pain change score, use of analgesics, and quality of life score.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Fewer patients in the adhesiolysis group than the control group reported no change or worsened pain (43 versus 58 percent), but the difference did not reach statistical significance. There was no difference between groups in quality of life or VAS scores after one year.</p><p/><p>These randomized clinical trials suggest that surgical adhesiolysis is not likely to benefit women with CPP, except possibly those with dense vascularized adhesions, especially when involving bowel. The absence of a significant benefit from adhesiolysis may be due to the high rate (greater than 70 percent) of <span class=\"nowrap\">reformation/new</span> formation of adhesions after the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>], or it may be because adhesions are not the source of the patient's pain. Since adhesiolysis can have significant complications, such as bowel perforation and postoperative new adhesiogenesis, its use as a treatment for CPP is not generally recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Myofascial pain syndrome (trigger point pain)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although abdominal and pelvic myofascial pain and focal tender points consistent with trigger points are often noted in patients with CPP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], treatment of this condition is based on anecdotal clinical experience, not rigorous clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

A randomized clinical trial comparing myofascial physical therapy to a control group treated with global therapeutic massage for the treatment of urological CPP reported response rates of 57 and 21 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Usually the dose is 1 to 5 mL of a local anesthetic (eg, 1 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> or 0.25 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a>) at each trigger point, with or without glucocorticoid (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> 10 to 40 mg per trigger point) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/29,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,31,32</a>]. The trigger point can often be felt as a taut band under the skin or a very localized area of intense tenderness; it may twitch involuntarily when touched (called a jump sign). Most patients respond after one or two treatments, but several injections every few days to fortnightly may be needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Dry needling, saline injection, and botulinum toxin type A injection have also been used for trigger point injections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local anesthetic patches &mdash; Efficacy of a 5 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> patch at the area of trigger point pain has been supported by at least one placebo-controlled randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The trial compared three treatments in patients with myofascial pain syndrome: a lidocaine patch applied to the trigger point for four days, a placebo patch applied to the trigger point for four days, and infiltration of the trigger point with two 1-mL injections of 0.5 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bupivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bupivacaine</a> hydrochloride given two days apart.

The authors concluded that direct needling of these sites appears to be effective, but it is unclear whether the response is due to a specific or non-specific therapeutic effect. However, trials using non-penetrating sham devices, which adequately control for placebo-effects, have generated negative results, implying that most of the therapeutic response after acupuncture is due to placebo effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

Heat acts as an analgesic in part by increasing blood flow and decreasing joint stiffness. It also may induce a state of mental relaxation.

Neuropathic pain refers to pain due to dysfunction of the nervous system in the absence of ongoing tissue damage. The pain is characterized as sharp, shooting, or burning, and is usually felt in an area of sensory deficit. It is worsened by mild stimuli that normally would not produce pain, such as light touch or cool air. The pain tends to be chronic and causes considerable patient discomfort.</p><p>Neuropathic pain can be treated with low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nortriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nortriptyline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a>, or narcotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. One trial, which randomly assigned 56 women with CPP to gabapentin (maximum daily dose 3600 mg), amitriptyline (maximum daily dose 150 mg), or both, reported significant symptom improvement in all three groups over two years follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Pain relief was significantly better in patients who received gabapentin alone or in combination with amitriptyline than in those receiving amitriptyline alone. There are no large-scale randomized clinical trials of the use of these agents to treat CPP.</p><p>The use of NSAIDs, opioids, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and adjuvant therapies for treatment of chronic pain of any etiology is discussed separately.

Both prospective and retrospective cohort studies suggest that hysterectomy significantly relieves or eliminates CPP in 78 to 96 percent of women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/59-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-63</a>]. A large prospective cohort study of women undergoing hysterectomy for benign conditions reported reductions in pain among women with both pain and depression preoperatively, and among women with pain only [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. The prevalence of pain in the two groups 24 months after surgery was 19 and 9 percent, respectively. Although fewer depressed women with pelvic pain improved after surgery than women without depression, the prevalence of pain was still significantly and substantially reduced from baseline in the group with depression.</p><p>Supracervical hysterectomy is performed more commonly than in the past, but it is not clear if subtotal or supracervical hysterectomy is an appropriate alternative option to total hysterectomy in women with CPP. One report of 70 women who underwent supracervical hysterectomy, 31 of whom had previously been treated for endometriosis, found that 17 subsequently required removal of the cervix [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Of those 17 women, 14 had been previously treated for endometriosis associated pelvic pain. These data suggest that 45 percent of women with a history of endometriosis who are treated by subtotal hysterectomy may require subsequent removal of the cervix.</p><p>Hysterectomy is not a good choice for the management of CPP in women who have not completed their family. Factors such as young age (less than 30 years of age) and a history of chronic pelvic inflammatory disease are associated with a relatively high chance of persistent pain symptoms following hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Nerve transection procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a few high quality clinical trials examining the efficacy of nerve transection procedures for the treatment of CPP. Laparoscopic uterosacral nerve ablation (LUNA) and presacral neurectomy (PSN) are the procedures studied most intensively. There is evidence that LUNA is not effective in the treatment of CPP and more evidence is needed before laparoscopic PSN can be recommended for treatment of CPP. The success of PSN may depend, in part, on the experience of the surgeon.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laparoscopic uterosacral nerve ablation &mdash; LUNA involves the destruction of the uterine nerve fibers that exit the uterus through the uterosacral ligament. Most surgeons destroy approximately 2 cm of uterosacral ligament near its attachment to the uterus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presacral neurectomy &mdash; PSN refers to interruption of the sympathetic innervation of the uterus at the level of the superior hypogastric plexus. PSN is performed by incising the pelvic peritoneum over the sacrum and identifying the sacral nerve plexus, which is then transected. The right and left ureters are the lateral margins of the dissection. The procedure can be performed via laparoscopy or laparotomy. PSN is technically more challenging than LUNA because of the presence of large vessels and the ureters near the field of dissection. PSN is considered most effective for relieving midline pelvic pain, but is not thought to be as effective for relieving pelvic pain in the right and left lower quadrants.</p><p/><p>A systematic review of two small randomized trials found some evidence of the effectiveness of LUNA for relief of primary dysmenorrhea at 12 months when compared to untreated controls (OR 6.12, 95% CI 1.78-21.03) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. However, the wide confidence intervals indicate that the efficacy of this surgical approach is uncertain and more data are needed. In women with endometriosis, a comparison of LUNA combined with surgical treatment of endometriosis versus surgical treatment of endometriosis alone found the addition of LUNA did not improve pain relief.</p><p>LPSN appeared to be more effective than LUNA, although data were limited to one small randomized trial. In this trial, patients undergoing LPSN were significantly more likely to have relief of primary dysmenorrhea at 12 months than those who underwent LUNA (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.03-0.32). In addition, PSN combined with surgical treatment of endometriosis was more effective than surgical treatment of endometriosis alone (OR 3.14, 95%CI 1.59-6.21). However, all of the procedures were performed by a single, highly experienced surgeon, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. The authors also commented that the efficacy of PSN may be specific to laparoscopic procedures and for midline abdominal pain only.</p><p>A subsequent large randomized trial not included in the systematic review found that LUNA did not improve pain, dysmenorrhea, or dyspareunia compared with laparoscopy without pelvic denervation in patients with CPP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>For both LUNA and LPSN, observational series have shown that success rates declined rapidly over time (years), possibly due to regrowth of nerves or pain signals being transferred via alternative routes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Sacral nerve root neuromodulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, neuromodulation for CPP has not been well-studied. Sacral nerve root neuromodulation for bladder related symptoms and pain is the best studied technique, but all trials are observational. A review of published case series suggests a 40 to 60 percent rate of improvement in pelvic pain symptoms after placement of either unilateral or bilateral lead placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-chronic-pelvic-pain-in-women/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].
