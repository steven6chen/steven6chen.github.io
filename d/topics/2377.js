Most of the time, bursitis happens around the shoulder, elbow, hip, or knee. It can also happen around other joints in the body.</p><p>A &quot;bursa&quot; is a small fluid-filled sac that sits near a bone. It cushions and protects nearby tissues when they rub on or slide over bones. These sacs, called &quot;bursae,&quot; are found in many places throughout the body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F65477\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65477 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F59257\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59257 \">figure 2</a>). Bursitis happens when a bursa gets irritated and swollen. This can happen when a person:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moves a joint over and over again in the same way, over a short period of time</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sits on a hard surface or stays in a position that presses on the bursa for a long time</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has certain kinds of arthritis, such as gout or rheumatoid arthritis, that can affect their joints and bursae</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gets hurt near a bursa</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has an infection that spreads to a bursa</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1472858861\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of bursitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of bursitis can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain or tenderness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble moving the joint</p><p/><p>A bursa can get infected if a person gets a cut on the skin nearby. An infected bursa can cause a fever and the area around the bursa to be:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Red</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swollen</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Warm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Painful</p><p/><p>If you have any of the symptoms of an infected bursa, let your doctor or nurse know as soon as possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1472858868\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for bursitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms and do an exam.</p><p>If you have symptoms of an infected bursa, your doctor might use a needle to remove some fluid from the bursa. Then he or she can do lab tests on the fluid to find out what is causing the bursitis, and if you need antibiotics.</p><p>He or she might also order imaging tests, such as an MRI scan or ultrasound. Imaging tests can create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1472858875\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to treat my bursitis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To treat your bursitis, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rest, cushion, and protect the area &ndash; Try not to irritate the area that hurts. For example, people with very painful shoulder bursitis might need to avoid lifting or carrying heavy things for a while. They might also need to wear an arm sling. People with bursitis behind the heel might need to use a thick heel pad. This can raise the heel so that it does not rub against the back of the shoe.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid positions that put pressure on the area &ndash; For example, people with bursitis in the front of the knee should avoid kneeling.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put ice on the area to reduce pain &ndash; Use a frozen bag of peas or a cold gel pack a few times a day for 20 minutes each time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put heat on the area to reduce pain and stiffness &ndash; Do not use heat for more than 20 minutes at a time. Also, do not use anything too hot that could burn your skin.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1472858882\"><span class=\"h1\">What other treatments might I have?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse might use other treatments, depending on your symptoms and where your bursitis is. Treatments can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain-relieving medicines called &quot;nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs&quot; or &quot;NSAIDs&quot; &ndash; NSAIDs include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve). These medicines can reduce pain and prevent the bursae from getting swollen and painful.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Steroid injections &ndash; Steroid medicines help reduce inflammation. These are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally. Doctors can inject steroids into the area of the bursitis to help reduce symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercises and stretches &ndash; Your doctor or nurse might recommend that you work with a physical therapist. A physical therapist can teach you stretches and exercises to help reduce your symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; A doctor can do surgery if other treatments do not work and you have had symptoms for a long time.</p><p/><p>People with an infected bursa might also have treatment that includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having the fluid in the bursa drained &ndash; A doctor can drain the fluid using a needle and syringe, or by doing surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1472858889\"><span class=\"h1\">Can bursitis be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To help reduce the chance that you get bursitis, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use cushions or pads to avoid putting too much pressure on joints &ndash; For example, people who garden can kneel on a kneeling pad. People who sit for a long time can sit on a cushioned chair.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take breaks, if you are using a certain joint too much</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop an activity or change the way you are doing it, if you feel pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lose weight, if you are overweight </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use good posture</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1472858896\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hip-pain-in-older-people-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hip pain in older people (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoarthritis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Osteoarthritis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=weight-loss-treatments-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Weight loss treatments (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gout-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Gout (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=knee-pain-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Knee pain (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=arthritis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Arthritis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=elbow-tendinopathy-tennis-and-golf-elbow-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Elbow tendinopathy (tennis and golf elbow) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
