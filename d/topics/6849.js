A successful kidney transplant improves quality of life and reduces the mortality risk for the majority of patients when compared with maintenance dialysis.</p><p>Patients with ESRD often have significant comorbidities. It is important that potential kidney transplant recipients are carefully evaluated in order to detect and treat coexisting illnesses, which may affect perioperative risk and survival after transplantation, as well as transplant candidacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-potential-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-survival-after-renal-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient survival after renal transplantation&quot;</a>.) The evaluation should be as efficient and cost effective as possible.</p><p>This topic will review the evaluation of a potential renal transplant recipient. The evaluation of the renal transplant donor is discussed separately.

Although no form of renal replacement is indicated at this level of kidney function, this early referral allows sufficient time for a complete evaluation and for interventions that may be required to address relative contraindications prior to transplantation, both of which can be time consuming. It also allows an opportunity for the candidate to explore <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> potential living-donor options in a timely manner, which may facilitate a transplant before needing dialysis. It is difficult to predict with accuracy the rate of deterioration of kidney function, and, ideally, the transplant should take place before dialysis is required. Studies have reported improved patient and graft survival when patients receive their first transplant before the need for maintenance dialysis, although this is not the case for patients who are receiving a second transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-potential-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dialysis-issues-prior-to-and-after-renal-transplantation#H63438807\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dialysis issues prior to and after renal transplantation&quot;, section on 'Timing of transplantation'</a>.)</p><p>The optimal timing of transplantation is not known with certainty. Patients should not undergo renal transplantation until renal function has irreversibly deteriorated beyond a threshold level of clearance. This absolute level remains unclear but should represent a degree of renal function not associated with signs or symptoms of uremia. Transplantation at higher levels of renal function does not confer superior outcomes than transplantation at lower levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-potential-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The 2005 Canadian Society of Transplantation (CST) consensus guidelines suggest that transplantation should not be performed unless the GFR is &lt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute</span> and there is evidence of progressive, irreversible deterioration over a period of 6 to 12 months (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F54575\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54575 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-potential-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. An exception may be made in cases in which the combination of kidney and nonrenal solid organ transplantation is being considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-function-and-nonrenal-solid-organ-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal function and nonrenal solid organ transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the United States, candidates can accrue wait time on the deceased-donor waitlist when the GFR is &le;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute</span> or when they are receiving chronic dialysis therapy. Candidates for combined kidney-pancreas transplant must also meet the same qualifications (GFR &le;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute</span> <strong>or</strong> receiving chronic dialysis therapy). For patients who are listed after initiation of chronic dialysis, preregistration dialysis time is included retroactively in wait time. Early referral thus remains important, particularly for predialysis patients who can accrue wait time prior to dialysis initiation. Pediatric candidates must be listed prior to their 18<sup>th</sup> birthday to receive pediatric priority.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial evaluation of the potential recipient should include a thorough medical, surgical, and psychosocial history and a detailed physical examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-potential-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/5,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9-11</a>]. Potential sensitization risks should be evaluated, including history of blood or platelet transfusion, pregnancies, and previous transplants. Special attention is directed at the cardiopulmonary exam, dentition, and peripheral arterial pulses. A careful examination of the abdomen for previous abdominal operations is also important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-potential-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/5,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,11,12</a>].</p><p>As noted above, the purpose of the evaluation is to identify comorbidities that could affect candidate survival after the transplantation. The evaluation also determines whether transplantation is technically feasible and may guide post-transplantation immunosuppression. Comorbidities that significantly shorten survival may render a candidate ineligible for transplantation because of the decrease in the absolute survival benefit conferred by transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-potential-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. There are a few generally accepted absolute contraindications to transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-potential-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H194691515\" class=\"local\">'Absolute contraindications'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition, there are multiple factors that may render a candidate ineligible for transplantation. Clinical practice guidelines for the evaluation of the renal transplant recipient have been published by several societies, organizations, and workgroups globally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-potential-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/4,5,8-10,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,8-10,16</a>]. Significant variability exists among these guidelines with regards to eligibility criteria (eg, age, body mass index [BMI]) and work-up (eg, cardiovascular testing) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-potential-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This variability has raised concern regarding equitable access to kidney transplantation. Generally accepted relative contraindications are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H194691615\" class=\"local\">'Relative contraindications'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194691515\"><span class=\"h2\">Absolute contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Absolute contraindications to renal transplantation include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Active infections.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Active malignancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Active substance abuse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reversible renal failure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uncontrolled psychiatric disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Documented active and ongoing treatment nonadherence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A significantly shortened life expectancy. There is no universally accepted life expectancy below which an individual is ineligible for renal transplantation, although a life expectancy of less than one year posttransplant precludes the possibility of transplantation at virtually all centers. Some centers are hesitant to transplant an individual with a life expectancy of less than five years since that is generally the expected half-life of the allograft. However, in other centers, individuals with much shorter life expectancy may be eligible for transplantation, depending upon the nature of the chronic illness.</p><p/><p>Recipient age alone is not a contraindication to transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-potential-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Many patients &gt;60 years of age and selected patients &gt;70 years have been transplanted safely and with an acceptable rate of long-term graft function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-potential-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. In the 2012 Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) report, recipients &ge;65 years of age comprised 18 percent of deceased-donor recipients and 20 percent of living-donor recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-potential-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, in order to be evaluated for transplantation, patients should have an estimated life expectancy exceeding the anticipated waiting time for a kidney, and kidney transplantation should not be pursued in cases where limited life expectancy minimizes the potential benefit of transplantation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194691615\"><span class=\"h2\">Relative contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many relative contraindications are identified by history, physical, and a targeted evaluation. These are discussed below.

These include malnutrition, primary oxalosis, and active systemic diseases that may have caused kidney failure (such as antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody [ANCA]-associated vasculitides or systemic lupus erythematosus). Some centers exclude patients with severe hyperparathyroidism, although the European Renal Best Practice kidney recipient evaluation guidelines recommend not refusing a recipient on the basis of uncontrolled hyperparathyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-potential-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Patients with severe hyperparathyroidism may be referred for parathyroidectomy prior to transplantation.

Proven habitual medical noncompliance or insurmountable psychosocial barriers to posttransplant compliance are a relative contraindication to transplantation. Patients with alcohol <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> substance abuse or those noncompliant with dialysis treatment need to be rehabilitated prior to transplantation. We require that such patients enroll in a rehabilitation program and remain drug or alcohol free, confirmed by random drug testing, and compliant with the dialysis treatment for at least one year before becoming active on the transplant list. Some centers require patients to abstain from tobacco, particularly patients with known cardiovascular disease or those at high risk (eg, diabetics). Additionally, some centers consider marijuana use a contraindication to transplant.</p><p>Social workers and psychologists trained in the evaluation of transplant candidates perform the psychosocial assessment, with referral for neuropsychiatric assessment if needed. Patients must be able to demonstrate understanding of the potential risks and benefits of transplantation, the need for lifelong immunosuppressive therapy, and the need for compliance with medication and follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-potential-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>]. Patients with severe cognitive impairment may be acceptable candidates for transplantation, provided that adequate caregiver support and supervised medication administration are guaranteed. Patients with mood, anxiety, or personality disorders should be referred to psychiatry for treatment in order to improve access to and success after transplantation.</p><p>Given the high costs of immunosuppressive therapy, financial resources and insurance coverage for each transplant candidate should be reviewed.

Despite this strong association, there is no consensus on whether or not and how to perform a functional assessment of the potential transplant recipient. Given the increasing age of kidney transplant recipients, we believe that a comprehensive functional assessment including functional status, physical performance, and frailty score should be performed in candidates older than 60 years of age. The best test remains to be elucidated, but some of the proposed ones include six-minute walk test, gait-speed test, get up and go test, grip strength, and frailty score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-potential-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>].

Recurrent disease, particularly if rapid, may influence whether to use a living donor in retransplant attempts. As an example, among patients with primary focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), recipients who develop recurrent disease in the first transplant are at very high risk (up to 75 percent) for recurrence in subsequent allografts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-potential-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/73,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,74</a>]. If the first graft is lost to recurrent FSGS, the chance of recurrence in subsequent transplant attempts markedly increases. Among such patients, both the potential donor and recipient should be advised of the increased risk of recurrent disease.</p><p>Although a history of prior graft loss from BK virus poses a particular concern because of the risk of recurrence, retransplant may be performed in selected patients. We recommend confirming the absence of viral replication prior to retransplant, although two successful cases of retransplant during active viremia have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-the-potential-renal-transplant-recipient/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

A successful kidney transplant improves the quality of life and reduces the mortality risk for the majority of patients when compared with maintenance dialysis. Candidates for kidney transplant recipients should be carefully evaluated in order to detect and treat coexisting illnesses, which may affect survival after transplantation, as well as transplant candidacy (see <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above). The evaluation should be as efficient and cost effective as possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who are interested in transplantation and who have no known contraindications should be referred to a transplantation program when the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>. This early referral allows sufficient time for a complete evaluation and for interventions that may be required to address relative contraindications prior to transplantation and allows time to recruit a live donor. (See <a href=\"#H255110068\" class=\"local\">'Timing of transplantation referral'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial evaluation of the recipient should include a thorough medical, surgical, and psychosocial history; a detailed physical examination; and laboratory evaluation. Potential sensitization risks should be evaluated, including history of blood or platelet transfusion, pregnancies, and previous transplants. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Initial evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contraindications to transplantation include current infection, active malignancy, chronic illness with shortened life expectancy, active substance abuse, and reversible renal failure. In addition, there are numerous relative indications that require careful evaluation.
