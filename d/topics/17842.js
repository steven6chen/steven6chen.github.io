Nodal evaluation of endometrial cancer is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometrial carcinoma: Pretreatment evaluation, staging, and surgical treatment&quot;, section on 'Staging and primary surgical treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H401861070\"><span class=\"h2\">Lower uterine segment involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We do not exclude women with cancer that involves the lower uterine segment from the low-risk group, although some experts do. While lower uterine segment involvement appears to be associated with worse survival outcomes, it may be due to the strong association of lower uterine segment involvement with lymph node involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-low-risk-endometrial-cancer/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. In this topic, women with lower uterine segment involvement can often be included in the low-risk disease population. This differs slightly from the guidelines of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) in which involvement of the lower uterine segment is considered as part of the group with intermediate-risk endometrial cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-low-risk-endometrial-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H367295881\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical staging with total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO), lymph node evaluation, and evaluation for extrauterine disease is the standard initial approach to women with newly diagnosed endometrial cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometrial carcinoma: Pretreatment evaluation, staging, and surgical treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, women who desire fertility preservation may be candidates for medical therapy. (See <a href=\"#H401861436\" class=\"local\">'Fertility preservation'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fertility-preservation-in-women-with-endometrial-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fertility preservation in women with endometrial carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H401861076\"><span class=\"h1\">IS THERE A ROLE FOR POSTOPERATIVE TREATMENT?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following surgery, the primary risk in patients with low-risk endometrial cancer is local recurrence (eg, at the vaginal vault). However, the risk is &le;5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-low-risk-endometrial-cancer/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. Therefore, we recommend that all patients initiate surveillance following surgery for pathologically confirmed low-risk endometrial cancer. We do not recommend postoperative (or adjuvant) therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-approach-to-endometrial-cancer-survivors#H202081543\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of approach to endometrial cancer survivors&quot;, section on 'Follow-up post-treatment'</a>.)</p><p>The rationale against adjuvant treatment is as follows:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8329889\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While radiation therapy (RT) can reduce the risk of local recurrence, it does not improve overall survival. Studies show that pelvic external beam RT (EBRT) may increase the risk of death and exposes women to a high risk of secondary cancers and treatment-related complications. While vaginal brachytherapy (VBT) is associated with less toxicity, there are no benefits to treatment to warrant its use.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 2012 meta-analysis of eight trials that evaluated RT for stage I endometrial cancer, among women with low-risk endometrial cancer (n = 517), RT was associated with an increased risk of death related to endometrial cancer compared with observation (relative risk 2.64, 95% CI 1.05-6.66) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-low-risk-endometrial-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study reinforces the lack of benefits and the heightened risks associated with EBRT for long-term survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-low-risk-endometrial-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In this study, 560 women with uterine-confined endometrial cancer were enrolled between 1968 and 1974. All patients underwent brachytherapy and were randomly assigned to pelvic EBRT versus no further treatment. In the main outcomes reported after a median follow-up of 20.5 years, EBRT was associated with:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>No survival benefit compared with observation (hazard ratio [HR] for mortality 1.13, 95% CI 0.96-1.35). However, among women under 60 years, EBRT was associated with a higher mortality risk (HR 1.36, 95% CI 1.06-1.76).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A higher risk of secondary malignancies (HR 1.42, 95% CI 1.01-2.0), which appeared greatest in women under 60 years (HR 2.02, 95% CI 1.3-3.15).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A higher rate of serious complications, including moderate (grade 2) events (27 versus 5 percent) and serious (grade 3 or 4) events (3 versus 0 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a multi-institutional European study, 645 women with grade 1 to 2 endometrioid endometrial cancer invading less than half of the myometrium (surgical stage IA) were allocated to either surgical treatment alone or to surgery plus VBT (three to six fractions were administered over 4 to 15 days. The dose per fraction ranged between 3.0 and 8.0 Gy, depending upon the number of fractions administered. Total dose administered was 18.0 to 24.0 Gy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-low-risk-endometrial-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. There were no differences in cancer-specific or overall survival. However, VBT was associated with an increase in genitourinary symptoms (eg, dysuria, frequency, incontinence) (2.8 versus 0.6 percent).</p><p/><p>These data show there are more risks than benefits associated with RT for patients with low-risk endometrial cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8329896\"><span class=\"h2\">Progestin therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because endometrial cancer is associated with excess estrogen production, progestin therapy has been used as an adjuvant treatment. However, we do not recommend adjuvant progestin therapy for women with low-risk endometrial cancer. In a meta-analysis of four trials, there was no difference in the risk of death at five years between adjuvant progestin therapy compared with no further treatment (relative risk 1.00, 95% CI 0.85-1.18) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-low-risk-endometrial-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Progestin therapy is an option for women are willing to take the risk of less effective therapy to achieve fertility preservation. (See <a href=\"#H401861436\" class=\"local\">'Fertility preservation'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fertility-preservation-in-women-with-endometrial-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fertility preservation in women with endometrial carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H401861436\"><span class=\"h1\">FERTILITY PRESERVATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reproductive-age women with low-risk endometrial carcinoma should be asked about whether they wish to preserve fertility. For women who are candidates for fertility preservation, the most common approach is progestin therapy and deferral of surgical staging (including hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy [BSO]) until after completion of childbearing. Use of this approach is limited to only women with low-risk disease, and the risk of recurrent or persistent disease is likely higher than with hysterectomy. Women who are candidates should be counseled about the risks and benefits so they can make an informed decision.</p><p>Fertility-sparing therapy for endometrial carcinoma is discussed in detail separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-endometrial-carcinoma#H4679282\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of endometrial carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a>.)</p><p>Because of the excellent prognosis with low-risk endometrial cancer, non-cancer-directed interventions may be a particularly effective means of improving outcome in this group of patients. Most women with low-risk endometrial cancers will die of another cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-low-risk-endometrial-cancer/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. The risk of both cancer and non-cancer-related death following endometrial cancer is elevated in diabetics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-low-risk-endometrial-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], and the leading cause of death among endometrial cancer patients is cardiovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-low-risk-endometrial-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. An association of the metabolic syndrome with endometrial cancer has been reported as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-low-risk-endometrial-cancer/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Although there are no data demonstrating that outcomes can be improved by more effective management of associated medical conditions, the provision of a survivorship care plan is indicated in low-risk endometrial cancer patients. These and other issues regarding survivorship for patients who have completed treatment for endometrial cancer are discussed separately.
