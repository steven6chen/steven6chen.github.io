They are the most common cause of moderate to severe diarrhea among children in Asia and Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-treatment-and-prevention-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In the United States, the incidence of <em>Shigella</em> infections is approximately 4 to 8 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-treatment-and-prevention-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The mortality in resource-rich countries is less than 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-treatment-and-prevention-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>The treatment and prevention <em>Shigella</em> infection in adults will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of <em>Shigella</em>, as well as the management of <em>Shigella</em> infection in children, are discussed separately.

In the absence of specific antibiotic treatment, patients with <em>Shigella</em> gastroenteritis may shed the organism for up to six weeks after the resolution of symptoms; risk factors for asymptomatic shedding are not known. </p><p>Complications of <em>Shigella</em> gastroenteritis, including bacteremia and severe colonic disease that results in obstruction or perforation, are uncommon in adults. However, individuals with underlying immunodeficiency (including HIV infection) or malnutrition are at increased risk for complications of and worse outcomes with <em>Shigella</em> infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-treatment-and-prevention-in-adults/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>].

Thus, antibiotic susceptibility testing is essential for management of all patients with <em>Shigella</em> infection. This is particularly important in patients who are at risk of infection with a resistant isolate, including patients with infections in Asia and Africa, those who report international travel, HIV-infected individuals, and men who have sex with men (MSM).</p><p>High rates of antimicrobial resistance were first reported in Asia, Africa, and South America, and antimicrobial resistance has spread rapidly to resource-rich countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-treatment-and-prevention-in-adults/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. In Asia and Africa, 65 to 85 percent of isolates are resistant to nalidixic acid (a quinolone) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a>, and 20 to 30 percent are resistant to fluoroquinolones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-treatment-and-prevention-in-adults/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Resistance to nalidixic acid has also been reported in England [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-treatment-and-prevention-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Increasing levels of resistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> have been reported in Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-treatment-and-prevention-in-adults/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>] and France [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-treatment-and-prevention-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A clone that has spread through parts of Vietnam displays resistance to third generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-treatment-and-prevention-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>In the United States, antimicrobial resistance is also an increasing problem. Clusters of ciprofloxacin-resistant <em>Shigella sonnei</em> have been reported throughout the United States, likely introduced by international travelers with subsequent domestic spread [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-treatment-and-prevention-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Furthermore, an increasing proportion of <em>Shigella</em> isolates in the United States have a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 0.12 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL,</span> which is not categorized as resistant but suggests the presence of a fluoroquinolone resistance gene associated with decreased susceptibility to fluoroquinolones in Enterobacteriaceae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-treatment-and-prevention-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Decreased susceptibility to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> (MIC &ge;32 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL)</span> has also been detected in several <em>S. sonnei</em> outbreaks and sporadic cases throughout the United States, predominantly among MSM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-treatment-and-prevention-in-adults/abstract/21-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-25</a>]. Scattered infections across several states with extremely drug-resistant isolates that are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> resistant and have decreased susceptibility to azithromycin have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-treatment-and-prevention-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. These isolates retain susceptibility to third generation cephalosporins (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefixime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefixime</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-treatment-and-prevention-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. There had been earlier reports of <em>Shigella flexneri</em> strains resistant to ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-treatment-and-prevention-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Since 1999, the National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System (NARMS) for Enteric Bacteria has tested every 10<sup>th</sup> (through 2002) or 20<sup>th</sup> (since 2003) <em>Shigella</em> isolate submitted from public health laboratories across the United States for antimicrobial susceptibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-treatment-and-prevention-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Among the 531 isolates tested during 2014 (mainly <em>S. flexneri</em> and <em>S. sonnei</em>), the following proportions of resistant isolates were reported: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ciprofloxacin</a> &ndash; 2.4 percent resistant (of note, this does not include those isolates that have suspected decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin [ie, MIC 0.12 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL])</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ceftriaxone</a> &ndash; 0.4 percent resistant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Azithromycin</a> &ndash; 4.7 percent with MIC &ge;16 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> for <em>S. flexneri</em> or MIC &ge;32 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> for all other <em>Shigella</em> species.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (TMP-SMX) &ndash; 41 percent resistant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ampicillin</a> &ndash; 34 percent resistant.

(See <a href=\"#H1111772052\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic selection'</a> below.)</p><p>As above, some cases of drug-resistant <em>Shigella</em> in the United States have been associated with international travel or adoption. As an example, in an analysis of data on 1118 <em>Shigella</em> isolates reported to the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and tested through NARMS between 2000 and 2010, strains isolated from individuals with a history of international travel within the preceding week were more likely to be resistant to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (75 versus 39 percent of isolates from those without such travel) or resistant to at least five antibiotic classes (13 versus 4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-treatment-and-prevention-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p>Decreased susceptibility to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> in the United States has been associated with infections among individuals who are HIV infected or with MSM. In an analysis of cases of <em>Shigella</em> infection with decreased susceptibility to azithromycin identified through NARMS or public health reporting, among those adults for whom information was available, 13 of 16 were HIV infected, 11 of 14 were MSM, and none of 29 had reported international travel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-treatment-and-prevention-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>The major route for dissemination of resistance to multiple agents is horizontal transfer of plasmids carrying antibiotic resistance genes (R-plasmids). A commonly isolated plasmid carries resistance against <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloramphenicol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloramphenicol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a>, sulfonamides, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=streptomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">streptomycin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-treatment-and-prevention-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Plasmid-mediated fluoroquinolone resistance genes have been implicated in cases of multidrug-resistant <em>Shigella</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-treatment-and-prevention-in-adults/abstract/20,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,31</a>], and macrolide resistance genes are also commonly plasmid encoded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-treatment-and-prevention-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Ampicillin resistance is mediated by beta-lactamases, most frequently OXA-1 and TEM-1.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8687025\"><span class=\"h2\">Supportive therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hydration is important to compensate for fluid loss from the gastrointestinal tract; oral rehydration is sufficient in most cases. Intestinal antimotility drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paregoric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paregoric</a>, diphenoxylate (Lomotil), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loperamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loperamide</a> (Imodium) should be avoided because of concerns about prolongation of fever, diarrhea, and bacterial shedding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-treatment-and-prevention-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-rehydration-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oral rehydration therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintenance-and-replacement-fluid-therapy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintenance and replacement fluid therapy in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotic treatment</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1111772046\"><span class=\"h3\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For symptomatic adult patients with documented <em>Shigella </em>infection, we suggest antibiotic therapy. Antibiotics are effective in shortening the duration of fever and diarrhea caused by <em>Shigella</em> infection by about two days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-treatment-and-prevention-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Antibiotic treatment also shortens the duration of pathogen shedding in stool, which is expected to reduce the risk of person-to-person spread, although this secondary outcome has not been definitively demonstrated. However, because most individuals will clear the infection spontaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-treatment-and-prevention-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], antibiotic treatment is not essential. We do not give antibiotics to patients with documented <em>Shigella</em> who become asymptomatic without treatment (eg, while awaiting susceptibility testing) unless there are public health issues (ie, if the patient is a food handler and may asymptomatically shed <em>Shigella</em> organisms for a prolonged period). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Natural history of infection'</a> above.) </p><p>In response to increasing minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to fluoroquinolones among <em>Shigella</em> isolates in the United States (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Antimicrobial resistance'</a> above), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended reserving antibiotic treatment for individuals with more severe symptoms, abnormal hosts, and special circumstances, including the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-treatment-and-prevention-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who are immunocompromised (including HIV-infected patients).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have severe disease characterized by bacteremia, intestinal or extraintestinal complications, or the need for hospitalization.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals who are food handlers, childcare providers, residents of nursing homes, or otherwise in settings that have the potential to spread the disease.</p><p/><p>Nevertheless, we continue to suggest antibiotic therapy for most symptomatic adults for the following reasons: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The secondary household attack rate for <em>Shigella </em>infection is approximately 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-treatment-and-prevention-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]; thus, although data are limited, there may be public health benefit to <em>Shigella </em>treatment. By shortening the duration of diarrhea, antibiotic therapy may reduce spread. Small randomized, placebo-controlled trials in adults and children with <em>Shigella </em>infection demonstrate reductions in diarrhea frequency and duration (by approximately 50 percent and two days, respectively), fever duration (by approximately one day), and bacterial shedding (two to five days versus up to four weeks with placebo) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-treatment-and-prevention-in-adults/abstract/33,35-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,35-38</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additionally, there are no data yet that indicate that elevated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> MICs that still remain under the breakpoint for susceptibility (ie, MICs of 0.12 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL)</span> are associated with worse outcomes with <em>Shigella</em> infections. In fact, in a large study of pediatric diarrhea due to <em>Shigella</em>, which included isolates that had elevated fluoroquinolone MICs, the failure rate with fluoroquinolone treatment was only 7.6 percent, and failure was not associated with an elevated MIC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-treatment-and-prevention-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p/><p><em>Shigella dysenteriae </em>type 1 produces a Shiga toxin that is structurally identical to one of the Shiga toxins produced by enterohemorrhagic <em>Escherichia coli</em> (EHEC) and is associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Unlike EHEC-associated HUS, antibiotic treatment of <em>S. dysenteriae</em> infection has not been observed to increase the incidence of HUS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-treatment-and-prevention-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], potentially because the mechanism that controls Shiga toxin production in <em>S. dysenteriae</em> is distinct from that in EHEC. Thus, risk of precipitating HUS should not be a consideration when deciding whether to initiate antibiotic therapy in a patient with <em>S. dysenteriae</em> infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-enterohemorrhagic-escherichia-coli-ehec-infection#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis and treatment of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) infection&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p>While culture data are pending, the choice to initiate empiric antibiotic therapy in the setting of diarrheal illness depends on the severity of illness and the presence of host factors that predispose to severe infection. This is discussed in detail elsewhere.

(See <a href=\"#H2223623723\" class=\"local\">'Directed therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>If initiation of antibiotic therapy is warranted prior to receipt of antimicrobial susceptibility testing results or if susceptibility testing is not available, the choice among agents typically active against <em>Shigella</em> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F68382\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68382 \">table 1</a>) should be informed by the risk of resistance based on patient demographics and the local prevalence of resistance. As an example, there is widespread resistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> in the Asian subcontinent and Africa, so infections acquired in these regions have a high risk of multidrug resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-treatment-and-prevention-in-adults/abstract/15,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,18</a>]. There is also a pocket of resistance to third generation cephalosporins in Vietnam. Additionally, in the United States, infections with isolates that are resistant to ciprofloxacin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> have reduced susceptibility to azithromycin have been mainly reported among HIV-infected individuals and men who have sex with men (MSM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-treatment-and-prevention-in-adults/abstract/21,23,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,23,26</a>]. For patients who have no clear risk factors for drug resistance, a fluoroquinolone is a reasonable empiric option. Empiric treatment for individuals at high risk of having a multidrug-resistant isolate can include a third generation cephalosporin (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefixime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefixime</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a>) until susceptibilities are available.

Although MICs in the 0.12 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> range will be reported as susceptible, such MIC values have been associated with quinolone resistance genes that confer reduced susceptibility to Enterobacteriaceae. The clinical significance of these MIC values in <em>Shigella</em> is unknown. In a large study of pediatric diarrhea due to <em>Shigella</em>, which included isolates that had elevated fluoroquinolone MICs, the failure rate with fluoroquinolone treatment was only 7.6 percent, and failure was not associated with an elevated MIC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-treatment-and-prevention-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]; however, treatment of enteric fever due to <em>Salmonella </em>Typhi and <em>Salmonella </em>Paratyphi isolates with MICs in this range has been associated with an increased rate of clinical failure with fluoroquinolone treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-treatment-and-prevention-in-adults/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. Given the possibility of impaired responses with an elevated MIC, when an alternative antibiotic is an option, it should be used instead. If a fluoroquinolone is given for treatment of <em>Shigella</em>, the duration is three days; five to seven days of therapy should be administered to patients with infection due to <em>S. dysenteriae</em> type 1 or with HIV coinfection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-treatment-and-prevention-in-adults/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Azithromycin</a> is an additional treatment option, but many clinical laboratories do not routinely test <em>Shigella</em> isolates for azithromycin susceptibility because there is no standardized testing for this. Some laboratories can perform azithromycin susceptibility testing when requested. When available, susceptibility testing to azithromycin should be performed, especially for isolates from patients who are MSM. Azithromycin should be avoided for <em>S. flexneri</em> isolates with MIC &ge;16 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> and other <em>Shigella</em> isolates with MIC &ge;32 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span>.</p><p>For management of infections due to multidrug-resistant <em>Shigella</em>, infectious disease consultation is advised.</p><p>Fluoroquinolones, macrolides, beta-lactams, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> all have established efficacy for <em>Shigella</em> when isolates are susceptible. In a systematic review of 16 trials evaluating these different antibiotic regimens, there was no consistent evidence that one particular agent was superior to the others, although the overall quality of the data was low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-treatment-and-prevention-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4159318759\"><span class=\"h3\">Follow-up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Improvement (eg, fewer stools, less blood in the stools, lower fever, improved appetite) is expected within one to two days if <em>Shigella</em> infection is treated with an antibiotic to which the isolate is susceptible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shigella-infection-treatment-and-prevention-in-adults/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. Patients who are treated with antibiotics should be evaluated for improvement of symptoms soon after this time frame. For patients empirically treated with antibiotics, if symptoms persist or worsen despite three days of antibiotic therapy, stool culture and susceptibility testing should be performed to evaluate for microbiologic failure and resistance. The antibiotic regimen should be adjusted to these susceptibility testing results. </p><p>In the unusual circumstance that symptoms persist despite treatment with an antibiotic to which the isolate has demonstrated in vitro susceptibility, other potential causes of the symptoms (eg, inflammatory bowel disease) should be considered, and switching to another antibiotic is reasonable.

Given the outbreaks of <em>Shigella</em> among men who have sex with men, such men should be particularly aware to avoid sex if they or their partners have or are recovering from diarrhea; to wash hands, genitals, and anus before and after sex; and to use barriers such as condoms and gloves during anal or oral sex.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Natural history of infection'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=shigella-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Shigella infection: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For adults with documented symptomatic <em>Shigella</em> infection, we suggest antibiotic therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We do not give antibiotics to patients who become asymptomatic without treatment (eg, while awaiting susceptibility testing) unless there are public health issues, such as in food handlers. Antibiotics have been shown to decrease the duration of fever and diarrhea by about two days. Shortening the duration of bacterial shedding with antibiotic treatment is also expected to reduce the risk of person-to-person spread. (See <a href=\"#H1111772046\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The increasing antimicrobial resistance of <em>Shigella</em> species is a major problem worldwide. Stool culture with antibiotic susceptibility testing is essential for management of all patients with suspected or documented <em>Shigella</em> infection. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Antimicrobial resistance'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=shigella-infection-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H428318760\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Shigella infection: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Susceptibility testing'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotic selection should be guided, if possible, by results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing.

(See <a href=\"#H1111772052\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If initiation of therapy is warranted prior to receipt of antimicrobial susceptibility testing results or if susceptibility testing is not available, the choice among these agents should be informed by the risk of resistance based on patient demographics and the local prevalence of resistance. For patients without risk factors for resistant infection, we suggest a fluoroquinolone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For patients with risk factors for multidrug-resistant infection (such as infection acquired in Asia or Africa, in HIV-infected individuals, and in men who have sex with men), we suggest a third generation cephalosporin (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1111772052\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hydration is important to compensate for fluid loss from the gastrointestinal tract; oral rehydration is sufficient in most cases. We suggest not using intestinal antimotility agents for symptomatic therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H8687025\" class=\"local\">'Supportive therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-rehydration-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oral rehydration therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frequent handwashing with soap and water is important for prevention, particularly after using the restroom and prior to food preparation.
