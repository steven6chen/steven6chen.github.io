It is composed of long polymers of a 1-4 linked glucose, interrupted by a 1-6 linked branch point every 4 to 10 residues. Glycogen is formed in periods of dietary carbohydrate loading and broken down when glucose demand is high or dietary availability is low (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81164\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81164 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>There are a number of inborn errors of glycogen metabolism that result from mutations in genes for virtually all of the proteins involved in glycogen synthesis, degradation, or regulation. Those disorders that result in abnormal storage of glycogen are known as glycogen storage diseases (GSDs). They have largely been categorized by number, according to the chronology of recognition of the responsible enzyme defect (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54417\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54417 \">table 1</a>). The age of onset varies from in utero to adulthood.</p><p>Glycogen is most abundant in liver and muscle, which are most affected by these disorders. The physiologic importance of a given enzyme in liver and muscle determines the clinical manifestations of the disease.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main role of glycogen in the liver is to store glucose for release to tissues that are unable to synthesize significant amounts during fasting. The major manifestations of disorders of glycogen metabolism affecting the liver are hypoglycemia and hepatomegaly. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiologic response to hypoglycemia in normal subjects and patients with diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glycogen is the primary source of energy for high-intensity muscle activity by providing substrates for the generation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The major manifestations of disorders of glycogen metabolism affecting muscle are muscle cramps, exercise intolerance and easy fatigability, and progressive weakness.</p><p/><p>Glycogen branching enzyme (GBE) deficiency (GSD IV, MIM #232500) is also known as Andersen disease. This topic will review GBE deficiency (GSD IV). An overview of GSD is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-inherited-disorders-of-glucose-and-glycogen-metabolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of inherited disorders of glucose and glycogen metabolism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GBE (amylo [1,4 to 1,6] transglucosidase) catalyzes the attachment of short glucosyl chains to a naked peripheral chain of nascent glycogen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81164\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81164 \">figure 1</a>). Deficiency results in abnormal structure of glycogen (similar to amylopectin), known as polyglucosan, with fewer branch points and longer alpha-1-4-linked glucose polymers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GBE deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the <em>GBE1</em> gene, located at 3p14. Although the enzyme is broadly expressed, the specific mechanisms that account for the variable clinical presentations are uncertain. However, absent enzyme activity is associated with severe disease, while milder phenotypes have residual enzyme activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycogen-branching-enzyme-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-iv-andersen-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Multiple mutations of the GBE gene have been associated with the neuromuscular form of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycogen-branching-enzyme-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-iv-andersen-disease/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Truncating <em>GBE1</em> mutations cause a spectrum of disease severity ranging from intrauterine hydrops to fatal perinatal hypotonia and cardiomyopathy, resulting in death during the first months of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycogen-branching-enzyme-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-iv-andersen-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Affected patients typically present in early infancy with hepatosplenomegaly and failure to thrive. Hypoglycemia is not a feature until late in the course of the disease, when it is associated with cirrhosis, esophageal varices, and ascites. Hepatocellular carcinoma may develop [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycogen-branching-enzyme-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-iv-andersen-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

These patients have symptoms and signs of upper and lower motor neuron involvement. In a review of 50 cases of APBD, the typical first manifestation was bladder incontinence, followed by gait disturbance and lower limb paresthesias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycogen-branching-enzyme-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-iv-andersen-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Some patients have an atypical form of APBD, with onset in early adulthood, a history of liver involvement in infancy, and a subacute relapsing-remitting course similar to multiple sclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycogen-branching-enzyme-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-iv-andersen-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">GBE activity ranges from 8 to 25 percent, depending upon the specific genetic defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycogen-branching-enzyme-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-iv-andersen-disease/abstract/18,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,22,23</a>]. Neuropathologic examination reveals accumulation of polyglucosan bodies (PBs) in the cortex (processes of neurons) and white matter (astrocytes and microglial cells) of the whole brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycogen-branching-enzyme-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-iv-andersen-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

In addition to the normal-appearing glycogen arranged in alpha and beta particles, fibrillar aggregations of glycogen are detected by electron microscopy. Fibrosis and cirrhosis are invariably present in the classic form of the disease. The diagnosis is confirmed by absent branching enzyme activity in skin fibroblasts, muscle, or liver <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mutation analysis of the entire coding region of the GBE gene (<em>GBE1</em>). In genetically confirmed cases, prenatal diagnosis can be performed accurately in subsequent pregnancies by analysis of DNA from chorionic villi or cultured amniocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycogen-branching-enzyme-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-iv-andersen-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Polyglucosan bodies (PBs) have also been detected in placenta at 25 and 35 weeks of gestation in two genetically confirmed cases, raising the possibility of prenatal diagnosis by histologic evaluation of placental biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycogen-branching-enzyme-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-iv-andersen-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>In patients with neuromuscular disease, the serum creatine kinase level is usually elevated. Elevated chitotriosidase, a marker of activated macrophages that is also increased in various lysosomal storage disorders, has been observed in several patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycogen-branching-enzyme-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-iv-andersen-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Muscle biopsy reveals the storage of periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain-positive material that resists digestion with diastase. The glycogen particles appear abnormal by electron microscopy, but they are often associated with normal beta particles. PBs are also observed in genetically distinct disorders, in particular deficiencies of the muscle isoform of glycogen synthase (GYS1), the autoglycosylating protein glycogenin-1 (GYG1) that serves as the building block for glycogen synthesis, and the ubiquitin ligase RBCK1. The progressive neurologic disorder, Lafora disease, also accumulates PBs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/glycogen-branching-enzyme-deficiency-glycogen-storage-disease-iv-andersen-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No specific treatment is available.
