Four categories of child maltreatment are commonly described: physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, and child neglect. Child neglect and emotional abuse will be reviewed here.

Child neglect is defined by the National Center of Child Abuse and Neglect as failure to provide for a child's basic physical, emotional, educational, or medical needs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-neglect-and-emotional-maltreatment/abstract/2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6</a>]. Specific types of neglect are defined as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Physical neglect</strong> &ndash; Failure to provide adequate food, clothing, shelter, hygiene, protection; inadequate supervision with risk of harm to the child.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Emotional neglect</strong> &ndash; Failure to provide love, affection, security, and emotional support; failure to provide psychological care when needed; spouse abuse in presence of the child.

The harm may be physical or psychological and may occur in the short- or long-term. Child neglect can be attributed to factors related to the child (eg, does not tell the parent about an injury), parent (eg, depression), family (eg, social isolation, religious beliefs), or community (eg, poor access to services) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53333\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef53333 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-neglect-and-emotional-maltreatment/abstract/4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7</a>].</p><p>Some authors define child neglect as the &quot;neglectful failure to supply the needs of the child&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-neglect-and-emotional-maltreatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Thus, neglect is a nondeliberate act and distinguished from the deliberate or malicious failure to supply the needs of the child, which they call &quot;deprivational abuse&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-neglect-and-emotional-maltreatment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Child neglect accounts for more than 50 percent of cases reported to child protection services in developed countries (eg, United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-neglect-and-emotional-maltreatment/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

At least one-third of these are a consequence of neglect (eg, abandonment, starvation, medical neglect, inadequate supervision) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-neglect-and-emotional-maltreatment/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>].</p><p>Risk factors for child neglect are related to a disorganized family system and include parental substance abuse, unemployment, physical disability, or cognitive impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-neglect-and-emotional-maltreatment/abstract/12,13,15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13,15-18</a>].

Thus, the assessment of poor weight gain or failure to thrive should include a history of dietary intake and feeding behavior, evaluation of the family's resources (eg, are they eligible for or receiving a supplemental nutrition program?), and consideration of other diagnostic possibilities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56603\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56603 \">table 1</a>).

Evaluation of these forms of physical neglect should include assessment of the family's resources and knowledge regarding injury prevention. Questions regarding these sensitive issues can be introduced with a statement like: &quot;I am interested in helping every child to be in a safe environment.

When medical neglect is being considered, the following questions are important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-neglect-and-emotional-maltreatment/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the recommended treatment necessary and likely to have a significant benefit compared with alternative treatments being used (or no treatment)?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is the child harmed or at risk of harm because of lack of care?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the possible barriers to care (eg, transportation)?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there cultural or religious factors that are contributing to lack of care or adherence to the treatment plan?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If medical treatment was delayed, would a reasonable layperson have recognized the need for medical treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Was the treatment plan clear?

Clear communication of the treatment plan may require written instructions or the services of a foreign language or sign language interpreter. The family should understand what to expect from the therapy, when to return for follow-up, and indications to contact or return to the healthcare provider before the follow-up appointment (eg, persistent or worsening symptoms) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-neglect-and-emotional-maltreatment/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>The healthcare provider should provide support and arrange for follow-up (by phone, office visit, or visiting nurse) to review progress and adjust the treatment plan if necessary. The involvement of child protective services must be considered, particularly when there is serious harm or a risk of serious harm, and when less intrusive interventions have failed.</p><p>All 50 states have laws requiring physicians to report child neglect to child protective services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-neglect-and-emotional-maltreatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

However, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) views such exemptions as potentially harmful to children and advocates that all children, regardless of parental religious beliefs, deserve effective medical treatment when such treatment is likely to prevent substantial harm, suffering, or death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-neglect-and-emotional-maltreatment/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

However, in circumstances in which the physician believes that parental religious convictions interfere with appropriate medical care that is likely to prevent substantial harm, suffering, or death, the AAP recommends that the physician request court authorization to override parental authority, or under circumstances of imminent threat to a child's life, to intervene over parental objections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/child-neglect-and-emotional-maltreatment/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H81901652\"><span class=\"h3\">Prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of interventions to prevent child neglect and abuse including clinic-based risk assessment, training of physicians in addressing risk factors, provision of informational resources to families and physicians, social work services, and home visitation have been studied.

(See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of child neglect requires that the healthcare provider convey to the family his or her concerns about the child's well-being and safety.
