The annual incidence of symptomatic Zenker's diverticulum in the United Kingdom has been estimated at 2 per 100,000 per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Symptomatic Zenker's diverticula are male predominant (ratio 1.5) and typically seen in middle-aged adults and older adults in their seventh or eighth decade of life. The occurrence of Zenker's diverticula shows geographical variation and has been described more frequently in Northern Europe, North America, and Australia than in Southern Europe, Japan, or Indonesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The pharyngoesophageal diverticulum was first described by Ludlow in 1767 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Zenker and von Ziemssen subsequently reviewed the world literature in 1877. Since then, this kind of diverticulum has been called Zenker's diverticulum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Zenker's diverticulum is defined as a posterior &quot;false&quot; diverticulum that has a neck proximal to the cricopharyngeal muscle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52971\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52971 \">image 1</a>). Most authors consider it among the other types of esophageal diverticula, all of which are outpouchings of one or more layers of the esophageal wall. &quot;True&quot; diverticula contain all layers of the intestinal wall. In contrast, &quot;false&quot; diverticula contain only mucosa and submucosa, while &quot;intramural&quot; diverticula are confined to the submucosa.</p><p>The classification of esophageal diverticula depends upon their location. They predominantly occur in three areas:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immediately above the upper esophageal sphincter (Zenker's diverticulum)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Near the midpoint of the esophagus (traction diverticulum)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immediately above the lower esophageal sphincter (epiphrenic diverticulum)</p><p/><p>This topic review will focus on clinical issues surrounding Zenker's diverticula. One of the clinical manifestations of Zenker's diverticulum is oropharyngeal dysphagia, which is discussed in detail, separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oropharyngeal-dysphagia-etiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oropharyngeal dysphagia: Etiology and pathogenesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oropharyngeal-dysphagia-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oropharyngeal dysphagia: Clinical features, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Zenker's diverticula (ZD) and epiphrenic diverticula are thought to be caused by motor abnormalities of the esophagus. In contrast, traction diverticula were originally thought to be due to scarring and traction on the walls of the esophagus (hence the name) from external inflammatory processes (such as fungal infections or tuberculosis). However, more recent evidence has demonstrated that many mid-esophageal diverticula are also associated with esophageal motility abnormalities including spasm, achalasia, lower esophageal sphincter hypertension, or nonspecific abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>ZD emerge from a defect in the muscular wall of the hypopharynx in a natural area of weakness known as Killian's triangle, which is formed by the oblique fibers of the inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscle and the cricopharyngeal sphincter. Autopsy series suggest Killian's triangle is more prevalent in males (60 percent) and is associated with the dimensions of the body and with the length and the descensus of the larynx [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Evagination of the sphincter is thought to result from chronic increased pressure on the weakened area, which may be due to two causes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High intrabolus pressures during swallowing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resistance to swallowing due to abnormalities of the upper esophageal sphincter (UES)</p><p/><p>The data supporting these hypotheses have been based upon manometric pressure recordings in patients with ZD. However, studies evaluating UES pressures in these patients have been inconsistent. The technical challenges of manometric data collection for UES function may account for such varied results. They may also reflect potentially heterogeneous defects that could result in a ZD and the variable methods used to record UES pressures. Furthermore, the presence of a diverticulum, particularly a larger one, may distort the pressure profile such that it no longer represents the conditions that originally favored diverticulum formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The results of several studies illustrate the types of observations made in patients with ZD:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one report, manometric and videoradiographic studies were compared in 14 patients with ZD and nine healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The timing of pharyngeal contractions and sphincter relaxation, opening and closure, and relaxation of the UES were similar. However, the UES opening was significantly reduced and intrabolus pressure increased in patients with ZD compared with the healthy controls.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A separate study from the same authors compared cricopharyngeus muscle strips from 14 patients with ZD to 10 controls (obtained at autopsy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Patients with ZD had marked differences in muscle fibers, including fibroadipose tissue replacement and fiber degeneration. It was concluded that these structural changes were responsible for the diminished UES opening in patients with ZD. Histologic analysis of the cricopharyngeal muscle of operated ZD patients was done and compared with specimens collected from nonaffected cadavers. Muscle tissue from ZD patients showed an increased collagen to elastin ratio both in the cricopharyngeal muscle and the muscularis propria of the adjacent esophagus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several other studies have demonstrated a variety of abnormalities of UES function, but the results have been conflicting; reported UES abnormalities have included increased pressure, decreased pressure, uncoordinated contraction, premature contraction, and relaxation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another report found that of 20 patients with ZD who underwent surgical correction, all had evidence of esophageal dysmotility; the majority of these patients also had gastroesophageal reflux [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. These results suggested that ZD was caused by general esophageal dysmotility rather than UES dysfunction. In support of this observation is our own experience in which we have noted the presence of Barrett's esophagus in approximately 15 to 20 percent of patients with ZD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The association with gastroesophageal reflux has been suggested since the 1970s, following a report of an increased incidence of hiatal hernia in patients with a ZD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A possible explanation for the association could be acid-induced esophageal shortening, resulting in a gap between the cricopharyngeus muscle and the pharyngeal constrictors, which permits herniation caudal to the constrictors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p>Considering these observations together, a reasonable hypothesis for the development of ZD is that it occurs in a variety of circumstances predisposing to herniation within Killian's triangle, such as abnormal esophageal motility, esophageal shortening, or disorders associated with altered UES function. Increased intrabolus pressures observed in patients with ZD may be secondary to impaired bolus passage in combination with or as a result of gastroesophageal reflux disease. An unanswered question is how spasms of the UES provoked by acid reflux could lead to increased intrabolus pressures during swallowing, given that swallowing is often distinct from episodes of acid reflux.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Zenker's diverticula are usually discovered in older adults, although they have been described in children. Most patients present after the age of 60 (often above age 75), having had symptoms ranging from weeks to years. For unclear reasons, the majority of patients are male [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Transient oropharyngeal dysphagia may be noted early in the course. The openings of large ZD are often aligned with the axis of the pharynx such that food is preferentially diverted into the diverticulum. When the pharyngeal sac becomes large enough to retain contents such as mucus, pills, sputum, and food, the patient may complain of pulmonary aspiration, foul breath, gurgling in the throat, appearance of a mass in the neck, or regurgitation of food into the mouth. Marked weight loss and malnourishment can occur in patients with longstanding dysphagia. The ZD may become so large that its retained contents may push anteriorly and completely obstruct the esophagus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Zenker's diverticula are usually diagnosed with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> swallowing examinations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52971\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52971 \">image 1</a>), preferably combined with dynamic continuous fluoroscopy during the swallowing process. In some patients, the entire first glass of barium taken will disappear into the confines of an especially large diverticulum. However, small diverticula can be missed if they are superimposed on the main column of barium in the esophagus. This can be avoided by rotating the patient during the examination. In our experience, a second diverticulum is present in approximately 1 to 2 percent of patients but is usually much smaller than the first. Esophageal manometry is typically not required; however, it may help to illuminate the pathogenesis of the diverticulum. An alternative method to diagnose ZD and to differentiate from a thyroid or neck mass is transcutaneous ultrasound. This technique might be a good alternative in people who experience difficulties in swallowing barium, provided the technique is in experienced hands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Zenker's diverticula can produce a variety of symptoms and complications such as aspiration pneumonia. In addition, a rare complication is the occurrence of squamous cell carcinoma in the diverticulum. The prevalence of cancer in ZD ranges from 0.3 to 7 percent &#160; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/20-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-24</a>]. Ulceration and bleeding due to retained medication has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p>Caution must be used during endoscopy or passage of nasogastric tubes because of the risk of inadvertent perforation of the diverticulum. In patients with a known ZD, it is advisable to intubate the esophagus under direct visualization. Endoscopes requiring blind passage (such as side-viewing endoscopes used for ERCP, endoscopic ultrasound endoscopes, and probes for transesophageal cardiac ultrasound) can be passed after an initial endoscopy with a forward-viewing endoscope and passage of an overtube or a guidewire [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Several reports suggested that video capsule endoscopy should not be performed in the presence of a Zenker's diverticulum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. If needed, the usage of a special endoscopic release device for video capsules in order to release the capsule distally from the ZD can be used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mainstay of treatment of symptomatic Zenker's diverticula has been surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-33</a>]. However, nonsurgical minimally invasive methods are being used increasingly. Although flexible endoscopic treatment has been heralded as being a cost-effective minimally invasive approach, limited numbers of endoscopists have been trained in this technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/8,34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,34-36</a>]. However, otolaryngology specialists in the United States appear to be increasingly adopting endoscopic diverticulectomy as the procedure of choice for the treatment of Zenker's diverticula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In case of failure with approach, patients are more often referred to intervention endoscopists.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery by external neck incision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are four described methods of surgical correction of a ZD:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A two-stage operation involving mobilization of the ZD and excision at a later stage when granulation tissue has formed around the ZD</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excision of the ZD in one step</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cricopharyngeal myotomy, leaving the ZD undisturbed</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cricopharyngeal myotomy with diverticulectomy or diverticulopexy</p><p/><p>One stage cricopharyngeal myotomy and diverticulectomy has been the preferred approach in patients who are good surgical candidates. The efficacy of myotomy is supported by a number of surgical series in which excellent or very good responses have been observed in 80 to 100 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/30,33,38-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,33,38-43</a>]. Recurrence rates for symptomatic diverticula of 15 to 35 percent confirm the importance of cricopharyngeal myotomy performed at the time of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].</p><p>A major concern related to diverticulectomy is the potential for causing mediastinitis. Thus, in high-risk surgical patients or in moderate-size pouches, cricopharyngeal myotomy and diverticulopexy has become the treatment of choice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/32,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,39</a>]. The procedure involves suspension of the lumen of the diverticulum in the caudal direction such that the orifice is directed away from the hypopharynx, thereby preventing the entry of food and secretions. Small symptomatic pouches can be treated with suspension or cricopharyngeal myotomy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Complications of surgical procedures for ZD include mediastinitis, vocal cord paralysis, pharyngocutaneous fistula, esophageal stenosis, and a recurrent or persistent ZD. A review of the literature of 41 studies with more than 2800 patients in total showed an overall surgical morbidity of 11 percent. Cervical infection occurred in 2 percent of the cases, leak or perforation in 3 percent, and recurrent laryngeal nerve damage in 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Intraluminal surgical approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diverticulostomy and myotomy have been performed with an intraluminal approach in some centers since the 1960s. The technique may involve coagulation of the bridge between the esophagus and the diverticulum with insulated forceps, and subsequent division of the coagulated tissue with a diathermic knife. This is called the Dohlman technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The procedure, performed through a rigid endoscope under general anesthesia, has been accomplished using a variety of coagulation and cutting devices including a CO2 laser [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Good results have been reported in up to 90 percent of patients. An advantage of this approach is that it is easier to repeat (in case of treatment failure or recurrence) compared with an open procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. In one review, the Dohlman technique showed a mean complication rate of 8 percent in nearly 500 patients. Two percent developed mediastinitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The same numbers were seen with CO2 laser. Symptoms and complications resolved in 93 percent.</p><p>A variation to this approach is the stapler-assisted method (endoscopic stapler esophagodiverticulotomy [ESED]). At least 15 studies of ESED have been published since an initial description in 1993 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/8,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,51</a>]. Overall, these data suggest that the stapling technique is safe and effective in the short term, with a significant reduction in hospital stay and convalescence when compared with other surgical techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/2,8,51-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8,51-54</a>].</p><p>Some authorities have concluded that ESED affords better symptomatic relief than endoscopic techniques, especially in patients with small diverticula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. On the other hand, others have maintained that diverticula smaller than 2 cm cannot be successfully treated with this method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. In patients with a small diverticulum, an external cricopharyngeus myotomy alone is generally preferred by otolaryngologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. A modification of the stapler-assisted method has been described, which enables this technique to be used for smaller diverticula as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>A potential limitation of the stapling device is that it may be difficult to place correctly due to the narrowness of the pharyngeal tube. One report suggested that the risk of incorrect placement of the staples could be reduced by placing a second tube in the stomach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Despite these innovations, not all patients are suitable candidates; in particular, the procedure cannot be performed in those whose anatomy precludes exposure of the diverticulum (with a &quot;Weerda&quot; diverticuloscope that is used for the procedure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Only one study has compared the total costs of open surgery versus intraluminal stapling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Costs of instrumentation were higher with stapling, but the shorter hospital stay reduced the overall costs significantly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Long-term follow-up, including the number of repeat procedures, is required to fully understand issues related to cost-effectiveness.</p><p>The durability of response to the stapled approach is unsettled. A review of ESED literature identified a recurrence rate in between 10 and 12 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/47,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,59</a>]. The complication rate was approximately 7 percent.</p><p>Another technique to cut the ZD bridge is with use of a harmonic scalpel. The harmonic scalpel is used in laparoscopic surgery to simultaneously cut and coagulate tissues with minimal spread of thermal energy. The harmonic scalpel blade can be used through the diverticuloscope and is especially suitable for cutting the septa of small ZDs (&lt;2 cm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. </p><p>The need for hyperextension of the neck, dental injuries, perforations, and recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis are concerns with this technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/47,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,62</a>]. Surgical exposure in rigid endoscopic repair of Zenker's diverticulum fails in approximately 30 percent of patients and is more likely in patients with short necks, decreased hyomental distance, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a high body mass index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>The decision to use an open surgical approach against a transluminal rigid technique is made on the basis of visualization, habitus, support of the ZD pouch against the posterior wall and failure of transluminal treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">FLEXIBLE ENDOSCOPIC APPROACHES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rigid endoscopic approach used by otolaryngologists was a major advance in the 1950s. However, surgery is not always a good option in symptomatic older adult patients. Despite the availability of flexible endoscopy for more than 30 years, the first reports using the flexible endoscope for treatment of ZD were not published until 1995 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/65-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">65-68</a>]. The same principle used in the rigid endoscopic approach can be applied during flexible endoscopy. This approach has emerged significantly over the last decade, influenced by significant advances made in interventional endoscopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The technique involves <span class=\"nowrap\">coagulation/cutting</span> of the septum, especially the cricopharyngeal muscle, between the esophagus and the diverticulum. The objective is to create an overflow from the ZD to the esophagus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F98000\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98000 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F98001\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98001 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F98002\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef98002 \">movie 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3999745945\"><span class=\"h3\">Patient selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At our institution, all patients with minor or major complaints related to the diverticulum are considered to be eligible for flexible endoscopic treatment. However, we explain the extraluminal alternatives, especially in those younger than 50 to 60 years of age. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Equipment and personnel</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High-resolution video endoscopes are preferred, although the procedure can be performed using older fiberoptic endoscopes. We generally use needle-knives <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> argon plasma coagulation (APC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], but monopolar forceps or other endoscopic cutting accessories can be used as an alternative. A flexible guidewire, gastric lavage tubes (CH 14-18) and a needle-knife should be available. One or, if possible, two experienced endoscopy nurses are needed to assist in the procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In our institution, the procedure is performed under conscious sedation. Deep sedation (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=propofol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propofol</a>) is an outstanding alternative if local experience and regulations permit. A key element is adequate endoscopic exposure of the ZD septum. This is usually achieved by insertion of a nasogastric tube (NGT), which is left in place during the procedure. The NGT also protects the contralateral esophageal wall from thermal injury during sectioning of the ZD septum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F74677\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74677 \">picture 2</a>). However, exposure of the septum with the NGT can be suboptimal, particularly in small diverticula or in those with a distorted axis with respect to the esophageal lumen. To overcome this limitation, a plastic overtube has been designed based upon the otolaryngology experience with the rigid diverticuloscope. The device has a double duck-bill extremity that fits the anterior esophageal wall and the posterior wall of the diverticulum, leaving the bridge in the center of the endoscopic field. Experience with this device has been promising, especially in larger diverticula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. In our experience, the size of the flaps of the double duck-bill might be risky in case of smaller diverticula.</p><p>A report of 10 patients demonstrated the successful use of a transparent, end hood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. The purpose of the hood is to permit a better view of the septum. One study compared the use of the flexible diverticuloscope with the use of a transparent cap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. A needle-knife was used for diverticulectomy. Remission rates were higher in the diverticuloscope group, while complications occurred more often in the cap-assisted group. Median procedure time was almost double in the cap-assisted group.</p><p>When using the APC-probe we begin 2 to 3 cm below the top of the septum and withdraw the endoscope while applying APC (ERBE VIO 300D, forced 50 W) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F55531\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55531 \">picture 3</a>). Alternatively, APC can be applied to the esophageal <span class=\"nowrap\">wall/Zenker</span> wall and then secondary applied to the top of the bridge. The narrow space and reflection of the light from APC can pose a challenge when trying to maintain an optimal field particularly when using Olympus-video-endoscopes, which are sensitive to interference from the ERBE generator. Small diverticula can be treated easily with this technique.</p><p>The technique with the needle-knife requires a longer learning-curve. In addition, it may pose a higher risk in patients who are coughing compared with using monopolar forceps or APC. On the other hand, the needle-knife (Endocut 3) is an attractive approach in patients in whom an excellent view can be obtained and in whom the septum appears to be atrophic. Alternatively, studies suggest that a hook-knife (a device developed for submucosal dissection) can be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Larger studies are needed to further evaluate this technique. Furthermore, the flexible bipolar hemostasis forceps developed for natural orifice transluminal surgery (NOTES) has been shown to be easy to use in an animal model for ZD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p>Using a knife or monopolar forceps, the initial cut or coagulation is made at the top of the ZD-septum. The transverse fibers of the cricopharyngeal muscle should be visualized. The <span class=\"nowrap\">cutting/coagulation</span> should be performed in the midline of the septum. We use mixed current (endocut) for the initial cut and coagulation current for dissecting the muscle fibers. If possible, we try to keep the esophageal and diverticular lumens under direct vision, which usually becomes easier after the initial cuts have been made. Early in the learning curve it is advisable to divide 2 to 3 cm of the ZD-bridge and then stop and repeat the procedure the next day.</p><p>If microperforations are suspected, the bottom of the cut can be closed using endoclips. These can also be used to achieve hemostasis if bleeding occurs. A clip-assisted technique, where prior to dissection with needle-knife, two endoclips were placed on either side of the ZD septum, has been used to prevent microperforations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].</p><p>After the procedure, we leave the NGT in place for at least two hours, but only perform contrast radiography in case of suspected perforation. If no perforation is suspected, we remove the NGT and only oral fluid intake is advised. The diet is advanced within the next few days. We do not feel that it is necessary to obtain a contrast study after subsequent treatments. With increasing experience in different centers, endoscopic diverticulotomy is becoming an outpatient procedure. Based on the difficulty of the procedure and patient age and comorbidities, patients may require overnight observation. Evidence regarding the benefit of prophylactic antibiotics are lacking.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3485330932\"><span class=\"h2\">Success rate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Flexible endoscopic approaches to Zenker's diverticulum are currently performed all over the world. The following illustrates the range of findings in the largest series.</p><p>One report described 58 flexible endoscopic myotomies using a needle knife and hook knife plus transparent cap. Mean ZD size was 2.8 cm. &#160;Initial procedural success was 100 percent. After a mean follow-up of 26 months, 77 percent reported complete symptom resolution. Esophageal microperforation occurred in 19 percent of the procedures of which 82 percent resolved with conservative management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another series described an approach using APC in 41 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Patients required a mean of three sessions, which was associated with a clinical success rate of 95 percent. One perforation occurred. Of the 34 patients whose follow-up was greater than six months, five patients experienced recurrence but were asymptomatic after retreatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A series of 21 patients were treated with monopolar forceps, using a flexible endoscope with a transparent cap attached to the tip of the endoscope [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Two patients needed two sessions, while the remaining 19 patients were asymptomatic after one session. Only one patient suffered from transient cervical emphysema. Follow-up was three months.</p><p/><p>Overall, the available data demonstrate long-term success rates from 77 percent to 100 percent Complication rates have varied from 5 percent (monopolar forceps) to 19 percent (needle <span class=\"nowrap\">knife/hook</span> knife). However, these were all case series. There is no prospective data comparing APC, monopolar forceps, or needle knife.</p><p>A retrospective analysis of flexible endoscopy versus endostapler technique reported similar outcomes in terms of hospital admission time, dysphagia resolution, and complications. However, significantly more time was needed for the endostapler technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. The endostapler can be used through a rigid diverticuloscope or alongside a flexible endoscope.</p><p>Our experience in over 1500 patients using the flexible endoscopy techniques described above has been similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Virtually all patients showed symptom improvement after one to two treatment sessions, a result that is remarkable given the comorbidities in the treated population of which 15 percent primarily underwent surgery. Four patients, all above 95 years of age, died within 30 days of treatment (approximately 1 percent): one from bleeding of the ZD bridge, and the other three from causes that were probably unrelated to the procedure (cerebrovascular accident in two and a pulmonary embolism in the third). Subcutaneous emphysema was observed in approximately 5 percent of patients, particularly those who were coughing. This emphysema typically resolved within 24 to 72 hours without consequences. Oozing of blood from the bridge was seen in less than 3 percent and was less likely when using coagulation current with the needle-knife. Oozing was also easy to control with APC.</p><p>Our current approach is to admit older patients with significant comorbidities after initial treatment. In case of an incomplete septum cut, we repeat the procedure six to eight weeks later. Approximately 25 percent of our patients experience a return of symptoms sufficient to merit revision. We treat those small remnant bridges under mild sedation, with a precut or Clutch Knife. The procedure is only repeated in those with recurrent or ongoing symptoms. Follow-up radiologic studies of patients treated endoscopically for ZD are generally not indicated to evaluate postoperative results since they do not correlate with symptoms of dysphagia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. After endoscopic treatment, the diverticulum will still remain visible on radiographs as a residual pouch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most serious complication is perforation of the GI tract. Perforation of a hollow viscous has traditionally been treated surgically. However, there has been ongoing debate regarding conservative management of esophageal perforations, but data are limited. Nonsurgical therapy generally includes administration of broad spectrum antibiotics, elimination of oral intake, parenteral nutrition, and nasogastric drainage. One report described a potential benefit from aggressive endoscopic lavage of mediastinal abscesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. More studies are needed addressing how complications should be managed.</p><p>Other complications have been mainly related to conscious sedation, such as periprocedural myocardial infarction and pulmonary complications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Training</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rarity of ZD, together with the different techniques available for the endoscopic treatment of ZD, make training difficult. We suggest that treatment of ZD be performed only by experienced gastroenterologists who perform diverticulotomy at least 25 to 50 times a year.</p><p>A porcine training model for endoscopic treatment of ZD has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. All domestic pigs have a pharyngeal diverticulum. The mean depth of these diverticula is 2.7 cm (range 1.3 to 5.0 cm). The diverticula resemble human ZD endoscopically and radiologically. The septum of the pig's diverticula also contains muscle, fibrous tissue, and fat, like the human ZD septum. Although no diverticulotomies in the pig model have been described, it is likely that this porcine model will become important for training endoscopists in the different flexible endoscopic techniques.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The precise cause of Zenker's diverticulum (ZD) remains unsettled but it occurs in a variety of circumstances predisposing to herniation within Killian's triangle, such as abnormal esophageal motility, esophageal shortening, or disorders associated with upper esophageal sphincter dysfunction. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of patients with Zenker's diverticula should be considered by the availability of local expertise. Experience is important, regardless of which method is used. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest flexible or rigid endoscopic treatment to be considered in centers with a trained endoscopist who has demonstrated favorable outcomes (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Exceptions might be young patients with large diverticula (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F98000\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98000 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F98001\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef98001 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F98002\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef98002 \">movie 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Flexible endoscopic approaches'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Referral for flexible endoscopic treatment should be considered in all symptomatic patients, especially poor surgical candidates. Patients with small diverticula, for example, can be treated readily with a flexible endoscopic approach in contrast to the endoscopic stapler approach, which may not be feasible. The flexible endoscopic approach may also be an option for patients who developed recurrent symptoms following surgery. Whether the rigid or flexible endoscopic approaches should be used as initial therapy in younger patients who would otherwise be good surgical candidates for open treatment is unclear. (See <a href=\"#H3999745945\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main advantage of the flexible endoscopic approach is the ease with which it can be performed without the need for general anesthesia, which is required for the surgical and rigid endoscopic approaches. Complications for the rigid and flexible approaches appear to be comparable. Because of its association with shorter operation times, shorter or no hospital stays, rapid resumption of oral intake, and easy access in case of recurrence, endoscopic diverticulotomy and myotomy, either rigid or flexible endoscopic, is the treatment of choice for ZD in the majority of patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There has been insufficient follow-up to assess the relative efficacy of the different endoscopic approaches, although emerging evidence suggests that the results are comparable to surgical treatment with shorter procedure time. Recurrent symptoms may develop if a myotomy has been inadequate or if there is reapposition of the cut muscle edges. In our experience, recurrence is more likely in patients with wide diverticula. In our and others' experience, the motor abnormality of the hypopharynx persists after treatment and myotomy may impair the propulsive activity of the hypopharynx. (See <a href=\"#H3485330932\" class=\"local\">'Success rate'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Comparing technical and clinical results from available literature is difficult because systematically collected data is missing and only case series have been reported. None of the available studies demonstrate superiority of one technical approach over the other. The choice of treatment will depend on the locally available expertise.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H567552250\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Dr. Stijn van Weyenberg, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zenkers-diverticulum/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Siddiq MA, Sood S, Strachan D.
