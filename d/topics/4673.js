While the targets of these agents differ, collectively they are referred to as molecularly targeted agents. Many of these agents, particularly those interfering with signal transduction (eg, epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] inhibitors, multitargeted small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors), are associated with prominent and sometimes dose-limiting dermatologic complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-side-effects-of-molecularly-targeted-therapy-and-other-biologic-agents-used-for-cancer-therapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic review will cover dermatologic toxicities seen with several classes of biologic and molecularly-targeted agents, including drugs and monoclonal antibodies targeting the EGFR, other therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and biologically active cytokines.
