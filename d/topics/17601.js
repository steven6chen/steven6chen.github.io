Treatment of cutaneous SCC is indicated since progression of the tumor may lead to local tissue destruction or metastasis resulting in significant morbidity or death. Early treatment provides the best opportunity to cure cutaneous SCC. </p><p>In contrast to basal cell carcinoma (BCC), which rarely metastasizes, around 2 to 5 percent of cutaneous SCCs metastasize to regional lymph nodes or more distant sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The approach to treatment is dependent upon the presence or absence of tumor features and patient characteristics that portend an increased risk for aggressive tumor behavior. Cutaneous SCCs that do not have high-risk features have low frequencies of recurrence and metastasis. </p><p>The treatment of cutaneous SCCs <strong>without</strong> features associated with aggressive behavior (low-risk cutaneous SCC) and the prognosis of cutaneous SCC will be reviewed here.

However, Mohs surgery has also been used for the treatment of tumors without high-risk features, particularly for tumors in locations in which a tissue-sparing surgical modality is desired (eg, tumors in cosmetically sensitive areas) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

However, high quality evidence comparing the efficacy of treatments for cutaneous SCC is limited and systematic reviews have found insufficient data for conclusions about the relative efficacy of available treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical excision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical excision is appropriate for both low-risk and high-risk cutaneous SCCs and is frequently used for treatment. Excision usually can be performed in an outpatient setting under local anesthesia.</p><p>Surgical excision is well tolerated and effective, and the completeness of the procedure can be evaluated through histologic assessment of the specimen's margins. The efficacy of surgical excision for cutaneous SCC is supported by observational studies. A systematic review that identified 12 observational studies that assessed tumor recurrence following surgical excision of invasive cutaneous SCC (1144 patients) found local recurrence rates ranging from 0 to 15 percent, with a pooled average local recurrence rate of 5.4 percent (95% CI 2.5-9.1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Recommendations for surgical margins vary depending upon the risk for local recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Well-defined, small (&lt;2 cm) cutaneous SCCs lacking any high-risk features require a 4 mm margin of normal tissue around the visible tumor to result in a 95 percent histologic cure rate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F83683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83683 \">table 1</a>). Surgical excision for high-risk cutaneous SCC is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recognition-and-management-of-high-risk-aggressive-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma#H90084851\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Recognition and management of high-risk (aggressive) cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Surgery'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Cryotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cryotherapy destroys malignant cells by freezing and thawing. It may be used for small, well-defined, low-risk invasive cutaneous SCCs and for Bowen's disease (cutaneous SCC in situ) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F82358\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82358 \">picture 1</a>). Based upon data from observational studies, the recurrence rate after cryotherapy appears low; a systematic review of observational studies that identified eight studies (with a total of 273 patients) that assessed recurrence rates for invasive cutaneous SCC after cryotherapy found a pooled average recurrence rate of 0.8 percent (95% CI 0.1-2.2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Contraindications to cryotherapy are shown in the following table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F64333\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64333 \">table 2</a>). The procedure should only be performed by clinicians trained in the treatment of skin cancer with cryotherapy.</p><p>In the most common cryosurgery technique, liquid nitrogen is applied to the tumor and a surrounding rim of normal-appearing skin (usually &ge;3 mm). The frozen area is then allowed to thaw in an unaided fashion. In most cases, the tumor is refrozen to complete two freeze-thaw cycles; for Bowen's disease, a single freeze-thaw cycle may be sufficient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Tumor cell death is due to the formation of intracellular and extracellular ice crystals, hypertonicity, disruption of the phospholipid membrane, and vascular stasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Cryosurgery does not permit histologic confirmation of the adequacy of treatment margins; thus, a substantial amount of training and experience is required to achieve consistently high cure rates.</p><p>Cryotherapy is fast, cost effective, and requires little if any anesthesia. Following treatment, there is usually moderate to severe swelling, pain, and oozing that resolve over days to weeks. The treated area subsequently sloughs, leaving behind an ulceration that heals over four to six weeks. This may result in residual hypopigmentation, permanent alopecia, or hypertrophic scarring that may be unacceptable to some patients. Treated areas on the lower extremities may take longer to heal. </p><p>Hypopigmentation can persist for many years and may be a particular problem for darkly pigmented individuals or patients with SCCs in cosmetically sensitive areas. When performed by experienced clinicians, cosmetic results are generally excellent, and cure rates as high as 96 to 99 percent have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/11,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13,14</a>].</p><p>Cryosurgery is not indicated for recurrent, large, deeply invasive, poorly defined, and other high-risk cutaneous SCCs because of the increased risk of local recurrence and metastatic spread. However, it can be considered for patients with high-risk tumors who are unable to tolerate either Mohs or excisional surgery or the frequent visits necessary for radiation therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recognition-and-management-of-high-risk-aggressive-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma#H90084858\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Recognition and management of high-risk (aggressive) cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Radiation therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrosurgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electrodesiccation and curettage (ED&amp;C) may be used for small, superficial, well-defined cutaneous SCCs and lesions of Bowen's disease (cutaneous SCC in situ) that are located in noncritical, low-risk sites. ED&amp;C is a relatively quick, well-tolerated office procedure that spares adjacent healthy tissue. It is associated with a low complication rate, is relatively inexpensive, and usually gives favorable cosmetic results.</p><p>Cutaneous SCCs and basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) have a distinctive &quot;feel&quot; that is distinctly different from normal healthy tissue. This &quot;feel&quot; guides the curettage of tumor tissue away from surrounding healthy tissue. By alternately curetting away tumor and then electrodesiccating the ulcer base plus a rim of surrounding normal skin, cure rates of 95 percent or better have been reported in carefully selected cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/7,15-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,15-20</a>].</p><p>As with cryosurgery, the main disadvantage of electrosurgery is the lack of histologic confirmation of the tumor margins, thereby limiting its use to small, well-defined primary (nonrecurrent) low-risk tumors. In addition, the cosmetic outcome in areas such as the nose, face, lips, or ears can be inferior to that obtained with either surgical excision or Mohs surgery, particularly for younger patients in whom cosmesis is an important secondary objective.</p><p>ED&amp;C is contraindicated for recurrent, large, poorly defined, and other high-risk tumors. Furthermore, it is inappropriate for tumors that invade into or beyond the subcutaneous tissues where the expected discriminating &quot;feel&quot; between cancerous and healthy tissue is lost. In these situations, ED&amp;C should be abandoned in favor of surgical excision or Mohs surgery.</p><p>ED&amp;C should also be avoided on the mid-face (mid-nose, nasal alae and sulci, medial canthi, and nasolabial folds). The embryonic fusion planes in these areas are believed to offer little resistance to the early and deep invasion by cancer cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. If tumors in this area are partially treated, healing skin can bury residual tumor beneath scar tissue. By the time a recurrence is clinically evident, the tumor can be massive and curative treatment extremely difficult or impossible. Thus, cutaneous SCCs located in the mid-face are better treated by standard excision or Mohs surgery. Radiation therapy is an option for patients not able or willing to undergo surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiation therapy is an option for the initial management of small, well-defined, primary cutaneous SCCs. However, due to the potential long-term adverse effects of radiation treatment, this modality is primarily reserved for older patients and patients who are not surgical candidates.</p><p>Various techniques have been used, including superficial x-rays, electrons, megavoltage photons, and brachytherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. Radiation therapy is usually administered in a fractionated schedule over several weeks, requiring as many as 30 treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In a systematic review of observational studies, pooled data from seven studies of external radiotherapy for invasive cutaneous SCC (comprising 761 patients) found a pooled average local recurrence rate of 6.4 percent (95% CI 3.0-11.0 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>One of the major benefits of radiation therapy is its sparing of normal, healthy tissue, thereby initially permitting superior cosmetic results for tumors located on or around the lips, nose, and eyelids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, these cosmetic results may deteriorate with time and are less favorable for larger tumors because of the higher doses of radiation required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Drawbacks associated with the use of radiation therapy include the lack of histologic control of tumor margins, high cost compared with other modalities, and the potential short-term and long-term side effects associated with radiation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F82148\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82148 \">table 3</a>). In addition, cutaneous SCCs that recur following radiation may behave more aggressively than those that recur after surgery, with higher rates of local recurrence and metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-cutaneous-squamous-cell-carcinoma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Situations in which radiation therapy generally should be avoided include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tumors located on the hands and feet. These areas are subjected to greater trauma and tension than skin on the head, neck, trunk, and proximal extremities, and may be more likely to break down and ulcerate as a result of the atrophy and poor vascularity of irradiated tissue.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients younger than 40 to 50 years of age, because of the potential for late complications, including skin malignancies secondary to the radiation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lesions over the nose or ears.
