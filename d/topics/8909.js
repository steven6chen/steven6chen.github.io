Inhalation agents are delivered via specialized airway circuits that are connected to an anesthesia machine, with scavenging of exhaled anesthetic gases to prevent environmental contamination of the operating room or interventional suite. Bottled volatile anesthetic liquids (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desflurane</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoflurane</a>, halothane) are delivered via vaporizers on the anesthesia machine. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrous-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Nitrous oxide</a> (N<sub>2</sub>O) gas is supplied as a pressurized gas in equilibrium with its liquid phase in a cylinder, then delivered via a flow meter on the anesthesia machine (similar to delivery of other gases such as medical air or oxygen). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-machines-prevention-diagnosis-and-management-of-malfunctions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia machines: Prevention, diagnosis, and management of malfunctions&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Uptake of an agent with onset of anesthetic effect, changes in anesthetic depth, and clearance of the agent with termination of anesthetic effect depend on pulmonary gas exchange via the lungs, and on the rate of change of the inhalation anesthetic's concentration in alveoli.

Also, the blood:gas partition coefficient for each agent (ie, the ratio of its solubility in blood to its solubility in gas) determines how quickly its concentration in pulmonary capillary blood reaches equilibrium with its concentration in alveolar gas (see <a href=\"#H1457610138\" class=\"local\">'Blood:gas partition coefficient'</a> below). Furthermore, uptake also depends on the patient's minute ventilation (the volume of gas exchanged in the respiratory system per unit of time) (see <a href=\"#H1482968331\" class=\"local\">'Respiratory factors'</a> below), and on the patient's pulmonary blood flow (ie, the volume of blood passing through the pulmonary circulation per unit of time) (see <a href=\"#H878593625\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular factors'</a> below). These factors determine the speed of equilibration of the concentration gradient of the inhalation agent between alveoli and pulmonary capillary blood, and thus influence the speed of anesthetic induction or emergence. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1118648993\"><span class=\"h2\">Redistribution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Redistribution of the inhaled agent depends in part on the tissue:blood partition coefficient (ie, the ratio of the agent's solubility in tissue to its solubility in blood) for each perfused tissue bed (see <a href=\"#H4132024233\" class=\"local\">'Brain:blood partition coefficient'</a> below), and also depends on the blood flow to these tissue compartments (see <a href=\"#H878593625\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular factors'</a> below). Specifically, production of the inhalation agent's primary effect in the brain (sedation progressing to general anesthesia) depends on the agent's brain:blood partition coefficient (ie, the ratio of its solubility in brain to its solubility in blood). Overall redistribution depends on blood flow to the brain and also to other perfused tissue compartments (see <a href=\"#H878593625\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular factors'</a> below).

Hepatic metabolism of halothane to hepatotoxic intermediates, particularly trifluoroacetic acid, is thought to be largely responsible for the transient, usually mild hepatic injury seen in approximately 25 percent of patients after halothane administration (halothane hepatotoxicity). Notably, an autoimmune hepatitis is thought to be responsible for halothane hepatitis, a severe and occasionally fatal hepatic injury that occurs in 1 in 1000 to 1 in 10,000 patients after halothane administration.

Specifically, redistribution out of the CNS depends on the presence of a concentration gradient favoring clearance from brain to blood, then from blood to alveoli (where the agent is exhaled from the body). Thus, for each agent, speed of clearance by exhalation depends on its brain:blood partition coefficient (ie, the ratio of its solubility in brain to its solubility in blood) (see <a href=\"#H4132024233\" class=\"local\">'Brain:blood partition coefficient'</a> below), and on its blood:gas partition coefficient (ie, the ratio of its solubility in blood to its solubility in gas) (see <a href=\"#H2857837935\" class=\"local\">'Partition coefficients'</a> below). Clearance also depends on the patient's minute ventilation (see <a href=\"#H1482968331\" class=\"local\">'Respiratory factors'</a> below), and on pulmonary blood flow (see <a href=\"#H878593625\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular factors'</a> below). Notably, most inhalation agents (with the exception of halothane) are exhaled unchanged because of minimal hepatic metabolism or renal excretion.

A lower blood:gas partition coefficient means that the inhalation agent is relatively insoluble in blood. Less agent is therefore required to saturate the blood compartment, allowing concentration of the inhalation agent in alveolar gas to reach equilibrium with its concentration in pulmonary capillary blood more quickly, thereby promoting more rapid induction and emergence.

Specifically the brain:blood partition coefficient (ie, the ratio of agent solubility in brain to its solubility in blood) determines the speed that the agent reaches equilibrium in the brain to cause its anesthetic effect. As with the blood:gas partition coefficient, a lower brain:blood partition coefficient means that the inhalation agent is relatively insoluble in brain.

Since blood flow to the brain is high, equilibrium between the concentration of an inhalation agent in the blood and the brain is achieved quickly.

Increasing fresh gas flow rates to be higher than minute ventilation will have no further effect on uptake and clearance, and will not influence speed of induction or emergence. However, if the fresh gas flow rate is less than the patient's minute ventilation, rebreathing occurs such that the inhaled delivered anesthetic concentration is actually a mixture of the concentration in the exhaled gas as well as the concentration in the fresh gas flow indicated on the vaporizer <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> flow meter settings.

Decreased CO is associated with decreased pulmonary blood flow and decreased uptake of inhalation agent, so that the alveolar concentration of the agent is maintained, allowing for more rapid equilibrium between the concentration of inhalation agent in alveoli and that in pulmonary capillary blood, thereby speeding induction. Thus, anesthetic overdose is more likely in patients with low CO.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In contrast, increased CO actually slows anesthetic induction. Increased CO is associated with increased pulmonary blood flow and increased uptake of anesthetic agent from the alveoli, delaying establishment of equilibrium between agent concentrations in alveoli and pulmonary capillary blood, thereby slowing induction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">After uptake of an inhalation agent from the alveoli, the relatively high blood flow distributed to the brain promotes rapid uptake of inhalation agent from circulating blood into the brain. Notably, the greater the solubility of an inhalation agent (ie, the higher its blood:gas partition coefficient), the greater the effect of CO on speed of induction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Emergence </strong>&mdash; The effect of CO on clearance of an inhalation agent and speed of emergence is more complex, given the interplay between tissue washout and pulmonary clearance. As with induction, decreased CO during emergence is associated with decreased pulmonary blood flow and decreased delivery of inhalation agent via the pulmonary circulation, which reduces the alveolar concentration to be cleared. However, decreased cardiac output during emergence delays washout of inhalation agent from all tissue compartments including the brain, which delays emergence. Conversely, increased CO during emergence increases washout of inhalation agent from the brain and other tissue compartments, potentially speeding emergence. The greater the solubility of an inhalation agent (ie, the higher its blood:gas partition coefficient), the greater the importance of tissue washout during emergence, and the greater the likelihood that increased CO will speed rather than delay emergence. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Considerations with congenital heart disease </strong>&mdash; In certain types of cyanotic congenital heart disease, a significant right-to-left shunt reduces pulmonary blood flow relative to systemic blood flow (ie, a pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratio [Q<sub>P</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/Q<sub>S</sub>]</span> that is &lt;1). Since the shunted flow bypasses the pulmonary circulation, the concentration of an inhalation agent in systemic arterial blood represents a mixture of the concentration in the pulmonary capillary blood and that in the shunted blood. This mixing slows the rate at which the concentration of an inhalation agent in systemic arterial blood reaches equilibrium with the concentration in inspired gas, with consequent slowing of uptake or clearance of the inhalation agent, and slower anesthetic induction or emergence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-anesthetic-agents-properties-and-delivery/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Although left-to-right shunt with relatively increased pulmonary blood flow (ie, a pulmonary-to-systemic flow ratio [Q<sub>P</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/Q<sub>S</sub>]</span> that is &gt;1) might be expected to increase uptake or clearance of inhalation agent, speeding anesthetic induction or emergence, such an effect is not predicted by computer modeling and has not been demonstrated in clinical practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-anesthetic-agents-properties-and-delivery/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1403794274\"><span class=\"h2\">Technique-related considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Modified administration techniques can be used to speed induction and emergence. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2197723143\"><span class=\"h3\">Concentration effect</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A higher inhaled concentration of the selected agent results in faster onset of anesthetic effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-anesthetic-agents-properties-and-delivery/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Higher inhaled concentration of inhalation agent promotes more rapid rise in alveolar concentration, resulting in a concentration gradient favoring transfer of agent from alveoli to blood. However, the concentration of a volatile anesthetic agent (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a>) should be increased gradually during inhalation induction of anesthesia to avoid the unpleasant pungency and increased risk of airway irritation (laryngospasm, bronchospasm) that can occur with rapid introduction of high concentrations.

For example, the breathing circuit may be primed with a high <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a> concentration (eg, 8 percent) plus N<sub>2</sub>O. Then the patient is instructed to take a vital capacity breath (defined as a complete expiration followed by a complete inspiration), followed by a period of apnea with inflated lungs (ie, &quot;breath-holding&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-anesthetic-agents-properties-and-delivery/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Typically, this single breath technique achieves the 2 percent alveolar sevoflurane concentration required to tolerate a painful intervention such as a surgical incision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-anesthetic-agents-properties-and-delivery/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3037530422\"><span class=\"h3\">Second gas effect</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A volatile anesthetic agent is often coadministered with N<sub>2</sub>O gas to speed induction by concentrating the volatile agent and increasing its rate of rise in alveoli, a phenomenon known as the &quot;second gas&quot; effect. Because of its very low blood:gas partition coefficient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F113972\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113972 \">table 1</a>), during induction, bulk transfer of N<sub>2</sub>O gas out of the alveoli lowers alveolar concentration of N<sub>2</sub>O, obligatorily increasing the concentration of other alveolar gases including the volatile anesthetic agent. This effect increases the concentration gradient between alveolar gas and pulmonary capillary blood, promoting uptake of volatile anesthetic and thereby speeding induction. Administration of N<sub>2</sub>O gas during and after induction also rapidly increases anesthetic depth and reduces the concentration of volatile anesthetic agent required for adequate anesthesia.</p><p>Second gas effects of N<sub>2</sub>O are more pronounced with coadministration of highly soluble volatile anesthetics (ie, agents with a higher blood:gas partition coefficient such as halothane or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoflurane</a>) since alveolar concentrations of these agents change more slowly compared with less soluble volatile anesthetics (ie, agents with a lower blood:gas partition coefficient such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desflurane</a>) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F113972\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113972 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Although coadministration of N<sub>2</sub>O with volatile anesthetic to take advantage of this second gas effect is most commonly employed to speed induction, coadministration may also speed emergence by diluting the alveolar concentration of volatile anesthetic, thereby increasing its rate of decline in alveoli. Because of its low blood:gas partition coefficient, upon discontinuation of N<sub>2</sub>O administration, bulk transfer of N<sub>2</sub>O gas into the alveolus increases alveolar concentration of N<sub>2</sub>O, obligatorily decreasing the concentration of other alveolar gases including the volatile anesthetic. Decreased alveolar concentration of volatile anesthetic increases the concentration gradient between pulmonary capillary blood and alveolar gas, promoting elimination of the volatile anesthetic and thereby speeding emergence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inhalation-anesthetic-agents-properties-and-delivery/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Notably, bulk transfer of N<sub>2</sub>O gas into alveoli during emergence also decreases alveolar oxygen concentration, potentially inducing desaturation, a process known as &quot;diffusion hypoxia.&quot; Diffusion hypoxia may be prevented by delivery of high inspired oxygen concentration for several minutes before and after discontinuing N<sub>2</sub>O.
