A variety of pulmonary complications have been described with these procedures, occurring either early (within the first 30 days or pre-engraftment) or late (more than one month or post-engraftment) after transplantation. This distinction can guide the differential diagnosis and clinical evaluation of these disorders.</p><p>The term &quot;hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot; (HCT) will be used throughout this review as a general term to cover transplantation of progenitor cells from any source (eg, bone marrow, peripheral blood, umbilical cord blood). Otherwise, the source of such cells will be specified (eg, autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sources of hematopoietic stem cells&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Significant pulmonary complications are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality following HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-after-autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The pulmonary complications of autologous HCT will be reviewed here. The pulmonary complications of <strong>allogeneic</strong> HCT are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-complications-after-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary complications after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUE OF AUTOLOGOUS HCT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Autologous HCT refers to collection of hematopoietic progenitor cells from the patient prior to the administration of high dose chemotherapy designed to target an underlying malignancy, followed by reinfusion of these cells. In the past, autologous bone marrow was obtained from the patient by multiple iliac crest aspirations under general anesthesia. However, most transplant centers now exclusively utilize peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) mobilized by hematopoietic growth factor administration for autologous transplantation. The cells are collected by leukapheresis, avoiding the need for general anesthesia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sources of hematopoietic stem cells&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPARISON WITH ALLOGENEIC HCT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pulmonary complications of autologous HCT share many of the features associated with allogeneic HCT, but there are also important differences. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-complications-after-allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary complications after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cellular interactions between graft and host cells are largely eliminated with autologous transplantation. Thus, graft rejection and graft-versus-host disease are insignificant and do not require prevention or treatment. The net effect is reduced need for pharmacologic immunosuppression after the transplant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posttransplant pneumonitis associated with cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is rarely a problem after autologous transplantation, in contrast to its high incidence after allogeneic transplantation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain other opportunistic infections, such as <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em>, are very rare after autologous transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-after-autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p/><p>The infectious complications during the first four to six weeks after both allogeneic and autologous transplants are primarily caused by bacterial and fungal infections secondary to neutropenia. </p><p>In both types of HCT, intensive treatment of the underlying malignancy with chemotherapy and radiotherapy (particularly to the chest) predisposes to serious noninfectious posttransplant pulmonary complications, including diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, idiopathic pneumonia syndrome, and drug or radiation toxicity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91069072\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH TO THE PATIENT WITH RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS OR SIGNS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to evaluating pulmonary complications that occur after autologous HCT begins with considering the timing of onset of the pulmonary disease (eg, early or late post-HCT), the appearance of the chest radiograph (eg, clear, focal opacities, diffuse opacities), and the following features: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk for certain infections is based on pretransplant serostatus (eg, cytomegalovirus, Herpes simplex virus, HIV, varicella-zoster virus, Epstein-Barr virus, toxoplasmosis), prior exposures (eg, cats, birds, mycobacteria, endemic fungi), current and previous immunosuppressive agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a>, glucocorticoids), and the history of prophylaxis for infectious agents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F64491\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64491 \">figure 1</a>). Bacterial infections account for approximately 20 percent of pulmonary complications of autologous HCT, while fungal infections account for 4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-after-autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

The acuity of illness (eg, fever, tachypnea, hypoxemia, leukocyte counts) and <span class=\"nowrap\">pattern/extent</span> of radiographic involvement help to guide the subsequent evaluation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dyspnea and normal chest radiograph</strong> &ndash; Patients with gradual onset of dyspnea and normal chest radiographs should undergo full pulmonary function testing with assessment of gas transfer by oximetry or arterial blood gas analysis.

Typical testing includes microbiologic studies, a plasma N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) concentration, and possibly an echocardiogram.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Almost all febrile HCT recipients are treated empirically with broad-spectrum antibiotics, until a causative organism is identified or an alternate diagnosis is confirmed. The choice of empiric therapy should depend upon the risk for specific infections and the susceptibility patterns at that institution (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F64491\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64491 \">figure 1</a>).

Blood cultures and serologic assays for galactomannan and beta-D-glucan should be obtained. Patients can often be given a trial of empiric antibiotics (based on local susceptibility patterns) with or without antifungal agents; bronchoscopy or other diagnostic procedures can be performed several days later if there is no response.

Acute respiratory failure necessitating mechanical ventilation is usually due to diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, bacterial or fungal infection, pulmonary edema (cardiogenic or noncardiogenic), or idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS). Viral infection causes acute respiratory failure in children more often than in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-complications-after-autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. While IPS can cause respiratory failure in the first few weeks post HCT, it is more common later in the course. (See <a href=\"#H91069047\" class=\"local\">'Idiopathic pneumonia syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p>The mortality of acute respiratory failure after HCT is high in both adults and children.

Bacterial infections in the first month are frequently due to Gram negative bacteria or to Staphylococcus or Streptococcus species. Vancomycin-resistant gram positive organisms, including <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, have been reported in immunocompromised hosts. Empiric antibiotic therapy for lung infection should incorporate susceptibility patterns at a given institution to cover these and other resistant organisms.

Chest CT scanning adds to the sensitivity of the plain radiograph for detecting fungal infection, since nodules may be seen on CT scan before they are visible on chest radiographs. A nodule with surrounding ground glass opacity (halo sign) strongly suggests the presence of fungus.
