We will also discuss the role of other injectable agents. The technique, indications, and complications that can occur with intraarticular and periarticular injections of glucocorticoids are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-technique-and-indications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Joint aspiration or injection in adults: Technique and indications&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Joint aspiration or injection in adults: Complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Intraarticular injections of chemicals or short-lived radionuclides, which are sometimes used as an alternative to surgical synovectomy, are discussed elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=synovectomy-for-inflammatory-arthritis-of-the-knee\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Synovectomy for inflammatory arthritis of the knee&quot;</a>).

Some of the more common uses for depot glucocorticoid injections include inflammatory arthritides, tendinopathies, and nerve compression syndromes, which are discussed in detail within the specific topic reviews.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4283588881\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some of the major differences among the depot glucocorticoid preparations pertain to differences in solubility, crystal structure, and duration of action, as well as other aspects of the chemical structure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraarticular-and-soft-tissue-injections-what-agents-to-inject-and-how-frequently/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Solubility is an important characteristic because compounds with lower solubility are thought to remain at the injected site for longer periods of time and result in lower systemic levels when compared with a compound of higher solubility. However, there are some data to suggest that decreased solubility does not always correlate with a more sustained clinical effect. As an example, in a randomized trial comparing the effectiveness of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> hexacetonide and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> acetate in patients with a symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (OA), methylprednisolone acetate appeared to have longer-lasting effects even though it is a comparatively more soluble compound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraarticular-and-soft-tissue-injections-what-agents-to-inject-and-how-frequently/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The crystal structures of the different glucocorticoid preparations also vary and can sometimes be difficult to distinguish from other intraarticular crystals related to an inflammatory arthritis such as monosodium urate (MSU), calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate, and hydroxyapatite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraarticular-and-soft-tissue-injections-what-agents-to-inject-and-how-frequently/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition to the actual glucocorticoid, there are other chemical ingredients and changes in the preparation such as the preservatives as well as the addition of a fluorine group. Flocculation of the glucocorticoid (precipitation of glucocorticoid crystals out of solution into a less bioavailable paste) can occur with addition of the methylparabens used as bacteriostatic agents in the local anesthetic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of glucocorticoid preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depot formulations are designed to stay at the injection site and display mostly local effects, although systemic effects can occur. There is limited evidence to guide the selection of a specific glucocorticoid depot formulation for injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraarticular-and-soft-tissue-injections-what-agents-to-inject-and-how-frequently/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The choice of different depot glucocorticoid formulations in a given practice is largely based on considerations that include availability, cost, and versatility of the agent (eg, ability to use for both joint and soft tissue injections). The author uses <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> acetonide in standard doses proportional to the size of the structure injected.</p><p>There are no large, randomized trials of various preparations with both toxicity and efficacy as endpoints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraarticular-and-soft-tissue-injections-what-agents-to-inject-and-how-frequently/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. In a survey designed to gather information about practice patterns among members of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), the most commonly used depot glucocorticoids were <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> acetate (35 percent), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> acetate (31 percent), and triamcinolone acetonide (22 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraarticular-and-soft-tissue-injections-what-agents-to-inject-and-how-frequently/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Among the more commonly used glucocorticoids, there were regional differences, with triamcinolone acetonide preferred in the West, methylprednisolone acetate in the East, and triamcinolone hexacetonide in the Midwest.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H578018672\"><span class=\"h2\">Variation of dose by anatomic location</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoid doses should vary with the structure injected. Dose should decrease along with the size of the targeted structure to avoid atrophy as well as to allow space to administer the volume without having to inject against pressure.</p><p>The author uses <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> acetonide at standard doses of 40 mg (1 mL) for a large joint (knee, shoulder), 30 mg for medium-sized joints (wrist, ankle, elbow), and 10 mg for small spaces (metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints, tendon sheaths). We mix the glucocorticoid with an equal dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> or comparable anesthetic; the rationale for this is discussed in detail below. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Should the glucocorticoid be mixed with a local anesthetic?'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Should the glucocorticoid be mixed with a local anesthetic?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the absence of definitive data, we typically dilute the glucocorticoid preparation with an equal volume of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> for a specific indication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraarticular-and-soft-tissue-injections-what-agents-to-inject-and-how-frequently/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Lidocaine mixed with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> should be avoided because if injected into a hand, epinephrine can cause prolonged vasospasm of digital arteries.</p><p>The major rationales for dilution with local anesthetic are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of the immediate relief from the anesthetic as evidence of good placement of the injection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decrease the propensity of the glucocorticoid to cause atrophy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decrease the tendency of the glucocorticoid crystals to serve as an irritant or proinflammatory factor (so-called postinjection flare) before the biochemical effect of the glucocorticoid takes over. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=joint-aspiration-or-injection-in-adults-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Joint aspiration or injection in adults: Complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>However, these observations in support of mixing the glucocorticoid preparation with local anesthetic must be balanced against two concerns: contamination of multidose vials and potential flocculation when the glucocorticoid is mixed with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a>. The flocculation of each of the various glucocorticoid suspensions occurs due to the bacteriostatic preservative within the anesthetic. Theoretically, this reaction should decrease the bioavailability of the glucocorticoid, but it seems to make little practical difference in duration of efficacy. However, multidose vials are a known, small infection risk compared with single-dose vials.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1806971998\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical considerations</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2313204298\"><span class=\"h3\">Frequency of injection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We limit the use of intraarticular and soft tissue glucocorticoid injections for any given indication. Safe frequency of injection is not an absolute number but varies according to the risk to chondrocyte viability and cartilage depth inherent to each disease: low for OA, high for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and irrelevant for knees affected by juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), where leg length discrepancy risk dominates over cartilage concerns. The appropriateness of repeated glucocorticoid injections is discussed within the relevant topic reviews. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-moderate-to-severe-knee-osteoarthritis#H1879045343\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis&quot;, section on 'Intraarticular glucocorticoid injection'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults#H3985847\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults&quot;, section on 'Intraarticular glucocorticoids'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polyarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis-treatment#H5061506\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Intra-articular glucocorticoids'</a>.)</p><p>In general, however, there are no clear evidence-based recommendations as to the appropriate number of injections from a risk-benefit perspective for most indications. As an example, the use of intraarticular glucocorticoid injections for OA is falling out of favor as there is increasing evidence that serial injections have negative effects on the progression of cartilage damage in knee OA. The best data to address this come from a randomized trial including 140 patients with symptomatic knee OA who received intraarticular glucocorticoid injections every 12 weeks for two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraarticular-and-soft-tissue-injections-what-agents-to-inject-and-how-frequently/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Patients who received two years of intraarticular <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> injections were found to have significantly greater cartilage volume loss measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The findings suggest that glucocorticoid injection offers no chondroprotection in knee OA. As a result of these data, serial injections for OA (eg, every three months) are not recommended. However, such results may not apply to active RA. Repeated injections for chronic tendinopathies or bursitis are typically discouraged given that glucocorticoids could potentially be harmful and increase the risk of tendon rupture. As an example, several studies suggest that glucocorticoid injections for lateral epicondylitis result in more recurrences and possible worse long-term outcomes.

A systematic review found insufficient evidence to confirm whether there was an increased risk of infection associated with receiving an intraarticular glucocorticoid injection in the hip prior to total hip arthroplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraarticular-and-soft-tissue-injections-what-agents-to-inject-and-how-frequently/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, a subsequent retrospective study with 173,958 patients undergoing primary total hip arthroplasty (THA) found an increased risk of periprosthetic joint infection after THA among patients who received an intraarticular glucocorticoid injection within the three months prior to surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intraarticular-and-soft-tissue-injections-what-agents-to-inject-and-how-frequently/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].
