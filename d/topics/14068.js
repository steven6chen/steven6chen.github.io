Such measurements are helpful for standardizing research and comparing the quality of patient care across ICUs. The common validated predictive scoring systems and their uses in the ICU are described in this topic. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPONENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Scoring systems are typically developed using prospectively collected data from a large number of patients from several intensive care units (ICUs): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data include previous and current clinical health information (eg, comorbidities, admission diagnosis) as well as physiologic and laboratory data (eg, mean arterial pressure, partial pressure of oxygen). (See <a href=\"#H2346593773\" class=\"local\">'Data collection'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The data are used to determine a numerical severity of illness score. (See <a href=\"#H1217549642\" class=\"local\">'Calculations'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The score, in turn, determines outcomes at hospital discharge including mortality, and sometimes length of stay. (See <a href=\"#H2907405921\" class=\"local\">'Outcome measures'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All instruments require validation prior to use. They can only be applied to patients admitted to the ICU since the score can only reliably predict outcomes for populations that were included in the derivation data sets. (See <a href=\"#H1740212439\" class=\"local\">'Validation and customization'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2269567316\" class=\"local\">'No generalizability'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All instruments should be periodically updated as they deteriorate over time due to worsening calibration which, in turn, leads to poor discrimination.

The updated versions of the Simplified Acute Physiologic Score (SAPS) and the Mortality Prediction Model (MPM<sub>0</sub>) use data collected within one hour of ICU admission, while the Sequential (sepsis-related) Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) instrument uses data collected 24 hours after admission and every 48 hours thereafter.

All scoring systems should be validated for a specific outcome in the population of interest before use. If they do not accurately predict the outcome of interest, they can be customized to improve performance. (See <a href=\"#H1740212439\" class=\"local\">'Validation and customization'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1539937654\"><span class=\"h3\">Mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All ICU scoring systems predict the likelihood of hospital mortality for patients admitted to the critical care unit. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3269337581\"><span class=\"h3\">Length of stay</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some investigators have also applied scoring systems to predict length of stay (eg, Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation-IV), although not all scores have this ability. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1867332060\"><span class=\"h3\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While many scoring systems use a calculated score to quantify disease severity, the SOFA score is also used to facilitate the identification of patients at risk of dying from sepsis.

Thus, many experts propose external validation and customization on an institutional, regional, or national level. As an example, SAPS 3 has several customized equations for seven different geographic regions worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictive-scoring-systems-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Several investigators have performed external validation of the major scoring systems, the details of which are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Predictive scoring systems'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H894400243\"><span class=\"h2\">Key characteristics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Accurate discrimination and calibration are two key characteristics that should be met by all predictive scoring systems. Traditionally, calibration can deteriorate over time largely due to the effects of case-mix and altered patient interventions, which often results in an overestimation of mortality, and consequently poor discrimination. (See <a href=\"#H795647934\" class=\"local\">'Poor performance over time'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3313346382\"><span class=\"h3\">Discrimination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Discrimination describes the accuracy of a given prediction (ie, its ability to discriminate between survivors and non survivors). As an example, if a scoring instrument predicts a mortality of 90 percent, discrimination is perfect if the observed mortality is 90 percent. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1616720940\"><span class=\"h3\">Calibration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Calibration describes how the instrument performs over a wide range of predicted mortalities (ie, the agreement between observed and expected numbers of survivors and non survivors across all probabilities of death). In the example above, a predictive instrument would be highly calibrated if it were accurate at mortalities of 90, 50, and 20 percent. Calibration is sensitive to alterations in case-mix and patient <span class=\"nowrap\">care/interventions</span>. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PREDICTIVE SCORING SYSTEMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Predictive scoring systems are typically used to predict mortality in general intensive care unit (ICU) patients (ie, mixed patient populations). They are occasionally customized to predict outcomes in specific patient populations (eg, liver failure). However, none of these can be used to predict outcomes in a specific individual patient. While none is superior, each have certain advantages and disadvantages which are described in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F107549\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107549 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2194791489\" class=\"local\">'General intensive care unit patients'</a> below and <a href=\"#H4275653755\" class=\"local\">'Specific ICU populations'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3321984518\" class=\"local\">'Uses'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2269567316\" class=\"local\">'No generalizability'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2194791489\"><span class=\"h2\">General intensive care unit patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The three major predictive scoring systems used to predict mortality in general ICU patients are the Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) scoring system, the Simplified Acute Physiologic Score (SAPS), and the Mortality Prediction Model (MPM<sub>0</sub>). APACHE-IV, SAPS 3, and MPM<sub>0</sub>-III are third or fourth-generation versions that have used data from a larger number of patients and more sophisticated analyses, compared with first and second generation scores. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The APACHE scoring system is widely used in the United States, of which there are four versions (APACHE I through IV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictive-scoring-systems-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/4-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-11</a>]. APACHE instruments require the input of a large number of clinical variables, from which a severity score is derived. The resulting severity score is entered into a computer-generated logistical regression equation, which predicts hospital mortality and in some cases length of stay. The required variables differ among the versions but generally include factors such as age, diagnosis, prior treatment location, and numerous acute physiologic and chronic health variables. </p><p><a href=\"http://intensivecarenetwork.com/Calculators/Files/Apache4.html&amp;token=F9sU++iEELXB1bNa0uwmdLuEbk0yeEXhSgFrhunOhl3xI9Phi93SsHl5j20zOdEd9yOpVh1Q5awDwveEBQoWxu4P9fTRpn6NFUStsLGoPSI=&amp;TOPIC_ID=1655\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">APACHE-IV</a>, the latest version, uses 129 variables derived from the worst values from the initial 24 hours of intensive care unit (ICU) admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictive-scoring-systems-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Data were generated from over 110,000 patients from 104 ICUs across the United States. Compared with APACHE II and III, APACHE-IV uses a larger set of variables, a new logistical regression equation, and new statistical modeling. The value of this version was illustrated by an observational study of 110,588 consecutive ICU admissions that found that APACHE IV predicted mortality more accurately than APACHE III [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictive-scoring-systems-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. A similar study found that APACHE IV predicted ICU length of stay, which is also an advantage compared with APACHE II and III as well as SAPS 3 and MPM0-III [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictive-scoring-systems-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. External validation studies also suggest superior discrimination with APACHE-IV when compared with other scoring systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictive-scoring-systems-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/1,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3313346382\" class=\"local\">'Discrimination'</a> above.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Advantages</strong> &ndash; The major advantage of APACHE-IV is that, similar to other APACHE systems, it is accurate in discriminating between survivors and non survivors. In addition, it can predict length of ICU stay. (See <a href=\"#H3313346382\" class=\"local\">'Discrimination'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1743989134\" class=\"local\">'Other'</a> below.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Disadvantages</strong> &ndash; When compared with their discriminatory capacity, APACHE systems, including APACHE-IV, have less impressive calibration (ie, deteriorating performance over time due to changes in case-mix and new therapies), such that periodic updating is necessary. However, when compared with other predictive scoring systems, it may be less affected by case-mix. (See <a href=\"#H1616720940\" class=\"local\">'Calibration'</a> above.). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, the burden of data entry for APACHE instruments is significant since, compared with other instruments, the number of input variables is high, particularly when the collection of data is manual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictive-scoring-systems-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This burden may lessen as electronic records systems can automatically extract the relevant data. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Another cited disadvantage is that the data are derived only from ICUs within the United States and therefore may not be accurate for patients in other countries. </p><p/><p>Although APACHE-IV is the most up-to-date version, some centers still use older versions including APACHE II (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-apache-ii-scoring-system-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Simplified Acute Physiologic Score (SAPS)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Simplified Acute Physiologic Score instruments (SAPS 1, SAPS 2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F53023\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53023 \">table 2</a>), SAPS 3 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F106775\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106775 \">table 3</a>)) calculate a severity score using the worst values measured within the first hour of admission to the ICU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictive-scoring-systems-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/2,3,13-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,13-19</a>]. Several of the variables are dichotomous, meaning that they are assigned a specific value depending upon whether or not they are either present or absent. The others are continuous (eg, age range) and points are assigned to ranges of values. All scores are entered into a mathematical formula, which predicts hospital mortality. The number of variables used is significantly smaller than the APACHE scores (eg, SAPS 3 uses 20 variables).</p><p>The latest version, SAPS 3, was designed and validated using data from almost 20,000 patients admitted to over 300 ICUs in 35 countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictive-scoring-systems-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/2,3,17,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,17,20</a>]. External validation in other ICU populations reported that SAPS 3 had good discrimination, but poorer calibration, especially when compared with APACHE-IV and MPM<sub>0</sub>-III [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictive-scoring-systems-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/18-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-22</a>]. Additional external validation in an Italian ICU suggested that SAPS 3 overpredicted mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictive-scoring-systems-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Nonetheless, it may be less affected by interventions than some of the other predictive scores. (See <a href=\"#H3313346382\" class=\"local\">'Discrimination'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1616720940\" class=\"local\">'Calibration'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Advantages</strong> &ndash; The main advantages of SAPS instruments are that data extraction is easier when compared with APACHE, such that they are consequently less labor-intensive. In fact, an automated version that can extract data from the electronic record (also known as eSAPS 3) has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictive-scoring-systems-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In addition, it may have greater potential for international use since data are derived from more than one country. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Disadvantages</strong> &ndash; Although SAPS 3 does not predict the length of stay (unlike APACHE IV), it has been used as a tool in studies comparing<strong> </strong>resource use between ICUs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictive-scoring-systems-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Mortality Prediction Model (MPM0)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are three versions of the Mortality Prediction Model (MPM<sub>0</sub>-I, MPM<sub>0</sub>-II, MPM<sub>0</sub>-III) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictive-scoring-systems-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>]. A severity score is calculated from variables, as assessed at the time of ICU admission (hence the term &quot;0&quot;). Except for age, all of the variables are dichotomous (ie, either present or absent). As an example, a systolic blood pressure &le;90 mmHg is worth one point, while all other systolic blood pressure values are assigned zero points. The final score is entered into a mathematical formula whose solution provides the predicted mortality. </p><p>While we prefer the use of MPM<sub>0</sub>-III, MPM<sub>0</sub>-II is more widely used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F77798\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77798 \">table 4</a>) and a score can be calculated at this site: <a href=\"http://intensivecarenetwork.com/Calculators/Files/Mpm.html&amp;token=x3QMs5Zu67JiWKyuPQZ0VB9uYfRjCCxsEM/KThawzA64gJ+MjqzmCj9MAlczEOxMA3+uJm4T4zpHZ+HY899pI6aoiyTPxd36EqOKpZZM4yI=&amp;TOPIC_ID=1655\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://intensivecarenetwork.com/Calculators/Files/Mpm.html</a>. The MPM<sub>0</sub>-II severity score can be re-measured serially (eg, 24 and 72 hours) allowing it be compared to the SAPS, APACHE, and Sequential (sepsis-related) Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), all of which have incorporated disease progression in to their predictions (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-mortality-probability-model-iii-mpm0-iii-for-critical-illness-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F106776\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106776 \">table 5</a>). The latest version, MPM<sub>0</sub>-III, was derived from over 124,000 patients in 135 ICUs, most of which were located in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictive-scoring-systems-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The MPM<sub>0</sub>-III has good discrimination and calibration, and has been externally validated in additional ICU populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictive-scoring-systems-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/1,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,26,27</a>]. There is some evidence that MPM<sub>0</sub>-III provides more accurate prediction of ICU mortality than MPM<sub>0</sub>-II [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictive-scoring-systems-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Advantages</strong> &ndash; MPM systems have the lowest extraction burden among the three major predictive scoring systems (APACHE, SAPS, MPM) since they do not use laboratory data but rather clinical and physiologic data only. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Disadvantages</strong> &ndash; MPM doesn't typically predict length of stay but older versions have been customized by some investigators for this purpose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictive-scoring-systems-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. It may be more susceptible to poor performance due to the effects of case-mix over time than the other predictive instruments (APACHE, SAPS). It may be less accurate in ICUs outside the United States.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H889841588\"><span class=\"h3\">Sequential (sepsis-related) Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The SOFA score was initially designed to sequentially assess the severity of organ dysfunction in patients who were critically ill from sepsis. The original SOFA instrument was derived from a cohort of 1449 patients admitted to 40 ICUs in 16 countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictive-scoring-systems-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Since multiple organ dysfunction is common in critically ill patients, it has since been used to predict mortality in those with organ failure from other causes including those with acute liver failure from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> overdose, chronic liver failure (CLIF-SOFA), and cancer, as well as in patients who have undergone cardiac surgery or hematopoietic stem cell transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictive-scoring-systems-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/29-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-34</a>].</p><p>SOFA uses simple measurements of major organ function to calculate a severity score (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-sequential-organ-failure-assessment-sofa-score-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 3</a>).

When choosing a predictive scoring system, it is important to use a score that was developed and validated recently and one that accurately predicts the outcomes in the population of interest (institutionally, regionally, or nationally) (see <a href=\"#H941655083\" class=\"local\">'Comparative efficacy'</a> below). Other factors that should be taken into consideration include feasibility, ease of use, and cost (see <a href=\"#H3430683274\" class=\"local\">'Ease of use'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2919429029\" class=\"local\">'Availability'</a> below). Importantly, once chosen, the instrument should be updated periodically to reflect contemporary practice and patient demographics, thereby avoiding deterioration in performance over time (ie, worsening discrimination and calibration). (See <a href=\"#H894400243\" class=\"local\">'Key characteristics'</a> above.)</p><p>Typically, most intensive care units (ICUs) and researchers use general predictive scoring systems, including Acute physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE), Simplified Acute Physiologic Score (SAPS), Mortality Prediction Model (MPM<sub>0</sub>), and Sequential (sepsis-related) Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA). However, clinicians should be aware of what the limitations are in a specific population of interest. As an example, SAPS 3 may underestimate mortality in patients with cancer and solid organ transplant, and SOFA may be more useful in a population with sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/predictive-scoring-systems-in-the-intensive-care-unit/abstract/41,51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,51-53</a>].

However, none of the specialized instruments are widely or routinely used and we believe that they should only be used when necessary (eg, when a specific population comprises a large percentage of the total ICU population or when a quality improvement program is in place for a specific ICU population). (See <a href=\"#H1743989134\" class=\"local\">'Other'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4275653755\" class=\"local\">'Specific ICU populations'</a> above.)</p><p>In general, APACHE-IV tends to be more accurate for predicting mortality than the other instruments, but is more burdensome, dependent upon proprietary software, and is more costly. In addition, APACHE-IV can provide algorithms to predict length of stay and is less affected by the case-mix but may not be applied to ICUs outside the United States. In contrast, the other systems are easier to use, cheaper, can be applied internationally (SAPS) but do not provide reliable prediction of length of stay, and are more susceptible to case-mix effects.
