They can cause itching and pain. Sometimes they can also make you bleed during a bowel movement.</p><p>In some cases, you can see or feel hemorrhoids around the outside of the rectum. In other cases, you cannot see them because they are hidden inside the rectum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F73076\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73076 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33215974\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should see a doctor or nurse if you have any bleeding or if your bowel movements look like tar. Bleeding could be caused by something other than hemorrhoids, so you should have it checked out.</p><p>If you do have hemorrhoids, your doctor or nurse can suggest treatments. But there some steps you can try on you your own first.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33215981\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to keep from getting more hemorrhoids?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important thing you can do is to keep from getting constipated. You should have a bowel movement at least a few times a week. When you have a bowel movement, you also should not have to push too much. Plus, your bowel movements should not be too hard.</p><p>Being constipated and having hard bowel movements can make hemorrhoids worse. Here are some steps you can take to avoid getting constipated or having hard stools:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat lots of fruits and vegetables. They have fiber, which helps to increase bowel movements.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take fiber powders, wafers, or pills. You should get 20 to 35 grams of fiber a day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take medicines called stool softeners such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docusate-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">docusate</a> sodium (sample brand names: Colace, Dulcolax) or bulk-forming laxatives. Bulk-forming laxatives include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psyllium-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">psyllium</a> seed (sample brand names: Metamucil, Konsyl), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylcellulose-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">methylcellulose</a> (sample brand name: Citrucel), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polycarbophil-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">polycarbophil</a> (sample brand name: FiberCon), and wheat dextran (sample brand name: Benefiber). These medicines increase the number of bowel movements you have. They are safe to take and they can prevent problems later.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33215988\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do to reduce my symptoms?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people feel better if they soak their buttocks in 2 or 3 inches of warm water. You can do this up to 2 to 3 times a day for 10 to 15 minutes. Do not add soap, bubble bath, or anything to the water.</p><p>There are also medicines that you can get without a prescription (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F104732\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104732 \">table 1</a>). They are usually creams or ointments that you rub on your anus to relieve pain, itching, and swelling. Some hemorrhoid medicines come in a capsule (called a suppository) that you put inside your rectum. Others come in a cream that comes in a bottle with a nozzle that you put inside your rectum. It is OK to try these medicines. But do not use medicines that have <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">hydrocortisone</a> (a steroid medicine) for more than a week, unless your doctor or nurse approves.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33215995\"><span class=\"h1\">What if the self-care steps do not work?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you still have symptoms after trying the steps listed above, you might need treatments to destroy or remove the hemorrhoids.</p><p>One popular treatment is called &quot;rubber band ligation.&quot; For this treatment, the doctor ties tiny rubber bands around the hemorrhoids. A few days later the hemorrhoids shrink and fall off. The doctor can also use lasers, heat, or chemicals to destroy hemorrhoids. But if none of these options works, there is always surgery to remove the hemorrhoids.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33216002\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=constipation-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Constipation in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-fiber-diet-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High-fiber diet (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregnancy-symptoms-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pregnancy symptoms (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemorrhoids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hemorrhoids (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
