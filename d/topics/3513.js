Associated angioedema occurs in about 40 percent of patients.</p><p>Standard management of CU primarily involves H1 antihistamines, sometimes at higher than usual doses and in combination with H2 antihistamines and leukotriene modifiers or other adjunctive agents. Short courses of systemic glucocorticoids to control severe exacerbations may be needed. This review discusses the treatment of patients whose symptoms are not controlled over time using these standard therapies.</p><p>Therapeutic options for patients with refractory CU will be reviewed here, as well as the evidence in support of the efficacy of each treatment. Standard management, as well as the diagnosis, pathogenesis, and prognosis of CU, are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-urticaria-standard-management-and-patient-education\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic urticaria: Standard management and patient education&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic urticaria: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, pathogenesis, and natural history&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1920020\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION OF CHRONIC URTICARIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In this review, the term &quot;chronic urticaria&quot; (CU) refers to patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, also called chronic spontaneous urticaria, with or without intermittent angioedema. Disorders involving isolated angioedema, urticarial vasculitis, and specific physical forms of CU, such as delayed-pressure urticaria, cholinergic urticaria, or cold urticaria, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-causes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of angioedema: Pathogenesis and causes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urticarial-vasculitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urticarial vasculitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-urticarias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical urticarias&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cold-urticaria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cold urticaria&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The terms &quot;chronic urticaria&quot; and &quot;chronic idiopathic urticaria&quot; are used synonymously in this discussion. Some studies distinguish between patients with and without positive autologous serum skin tests (ASSTs) or other laboratory indicators of an autoimmune process. This distinction is mentioned in the text only if a study found a difference between these two patient groups. The interpretation of a positive ASST in patients with CU is reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic urticaria: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, pathogenesis, and natural history&quot;, section on 'Autoimmune theory'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1919908\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Available data indicate that H1 antihistamines at higher than standard doses will adequately control CU symptoms in 60 to 70 percent of patients, and a small number will get additional benefit from the other supplementary therapies that have few side effects (eg, H2 antihistamines, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=montelukast-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">montelukast</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-urticaria-standard-management-and-patient-education#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic urticaria: Standard management and patient education&quot;, section on 'H1 antihistamines'</a>.)</p><p>Patients whose symptoms are not controlled over time using standard therapy may receive repeated courses of glucocorticoids or have extended periods of glucocorticoids exposure (eg, months of treatment). However, long-term oral glucocorticoids have potentially severe side effects and do not appear to induce lasting remission or alter the natural history of the disorder. Thus, it is preferable to use oral glucocorticoids for short periods and at the minimally effective dose necessary to achieve control and to consider other treatment options before the patient has been exposed to months of glucocorticoid therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The options for refractory CU include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omalizumab</a>, as well as several drugs that have either anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressant effects. There is no standardized approach to the management of refractory CU, and published guidelines only list options to be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-treatment-of-refractory-symptoms/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Therefore, the approach of the author, which is based on clinical experience, is presented here to provide additional guidance, although therapy must be individualized. The decision to use a certain medication should be based upon an assessment of risk versus benefit for that specific patient, taking into account concomitant medical conditions and patient preferences.</p><p>When introducing these more advanced treatments, antihistamines and other standard agents that were clearly helpful to the patient are typically continued. Any medications of uncertain benefit should be discontinued, so that medications do not accumulate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H642386\"><span class=\"h2\">Terminology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In this discussion, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omalizumab</a> is considered separately, and the other agents are divided into two groups: &quot;anti-inflammatory&quot; agents and &quot;immunosuppressant&quot; agents, although there is considerable overlap between the latter two groups of drugs.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Anti-inflammatory&quot; denotes a class of agents with predominantly anti-inflammatory activities, which have low potential toxicity and less proven efficacy for CU. We have applied this term to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The term &quot;immunosuppressant&quot; is applied to drugs that have more potent immunosuppression activity and greater potential toxicity, as well as more evidence for efficacy. We have categorized the calcineurin inhibitors, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil in this way.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22593276\"><span class=\"h2\">Goal of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of therapy in patients with refractory CU is to achieve a level of symptom control and improvement in quality of life that is acceptable to the patient, while minimizing therapy-related side effects. Patients differ in their preferences. Some want to pursue complete remission while others would rather minimize medications and accept a low level of ongoing symptoms. In addition, it should be kept in mind that although CU can be a disabling disorder, it does not lead to permanent organ damage, and it ultimately resolves in the majority of patients, with or without treatment. Thus, a treatment that appears to be inducing serious adverse side effects is not warranted. The natural history of CU is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic urticaria: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, pathogenesis, and natural history&quot;, section on 'Natural history and prognosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1920133\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of initial intervention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Omalizumab</a>, a monoclonal antibody against immunoglobulin E (IgE), was approved for CU refractory to H1 antihistamines by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2014. However, the high cost of omalizumab is a concern in all health care systems and will limit the use of this therapy in many settings. (See <a href=\"#H22592681\" class=\"local\">'Omalizumab'</a> below.)</p><p>Since most patients have received extended courses of glucocorticoids by the time the treatments discussed in this topic review are considered, our approach has been to stratify patients by the presence or absence of glucocorticoid toxicity (eg, significant weight gain, hypertension, gastritis, hyperglycemia, etc) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F65998\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65998 \">table 1</a>). This approach is based largely on expert opinion, because studies comparing these agents with each other are lacking, and guidelines for CU have not yet incorporated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omalizumab</a>.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients <strong>without</strong> glucocorticoid toxicity, we begin with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omalizumab</a> or one of the anti-inflammatory agents (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a>). Omalizumab is safe and effective for most patients, but it is very costly, requires regular visits to a clinic for administration, and does not appear to induce lasting remission. In addition, in the United States, there is usually an initial delay in therapy as the necessary administrative work is completed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The anti-inflammatory agents, on the other hand, may have long-term disease-modifying effects, are less expensive, and do not require visits to a clinic for administration (they are all oral medications). However, they are less reliably effective, may have a slower onset of action, and have side effects in some patients (albeit a minority).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who already display evidence of glucocorticoid toxicity, there is a more urgent need to control symptoms so that glucocorticoids can be reduced or discontinued. For this group, we suggest either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omalizumab</a> or an immunosuppressant agent (in preference to an anti-inflammatory drug), as these therapies produce a more rapid effect and appear to be more reliably effective (although comparative studies are lacking).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22592681\"><span class=\"h1\">OMALIZUMAB</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Omalizumab</a> is a monoclonal antibody directed against immunoglobulin E (IgE), which was approved in the United States in 2014 for the treatment of patients 12 years of age and older with CU that is not controlled with standard dose H1 antihistamine therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-treatment-of-refractory-symptoms/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It is included in the guidelines for management of CU in multiple countries.

Up-dosing of antihistamines is reviewed separately.

Doses ranged from 75 mg every four weeks to 600 mg every two weeks, but the most effective dose was 300 mg every four weeks, at which 36 percent of patients had a complete response (urticaria activity score of 0). Adverse event rates and specific events were similar with omalizumab and placebo.</p><p>One trial included in the meta-analysis was particularly informative, because it closely approximated common clinical practice. The GLACIAL trial evaluated 335 patients whose symptoms were not controlled with H1 antihistamines (up to four times the standard dose) plus H2 antihistamines, antileukotriene agents, or the combination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-treatment-of-refractory-symptoms/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Subjects were randomized to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omalizumab</a> (300 mg monthly) or placebo. In the omalizumab group, 73 percent of subjects were receiving one to two times standard H1 antihistamines, and 27 percent were receiving three to four times standard doses. These medications were continued unchanged throughout the study period and the four-month follow-up period. The primary endpoint was a change in mean weekly itch severity scores (on a scale from 0 to 21, with a minimally important difference of 5) at the end of 12 weeks. Clinical efficacy was apparent by one week in the 300 mg group. Mean itch scores decreased a clinically meaningful amount only in the omalizumab group, and the difference between the two groups was statistically significant. A minimally important difference in symptoms was achieved by 70 and 40 percent of subjects in the omalizumab and placebo groups, respectively. At 12 weeks, 34 and 5 percent of subjects were itch- and hive-free in the omalizumab and placebo groups, respectively. As in other trials, subjects' symptoms gradually returned during the observation period off of omalizumab and were similar to placebo at the end of observation. This study suggests that the addition of omalizumab to the combination of maximally dosed H1 antihistamines plus other commonly used medications will control symptoms in another 30 to 35 percent of patients. Taken together with efficacy data on antihistamine therapy, satisfactory control of symptoms can be anticipated in approximately 80 percent of patients with the combination of antihistamines and omalizumab.</p><p>Another analysis of multiple trials evaluated the extent and time course of the response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omalizumab</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-treatment-of-refractory-symptoms/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Overall, there was a meaningful reduction in symptoms in approximately 60 percent of patients by week 12. Approximately 40 percent of patients became asymptomatic by week 12 and about 45 percent by week 24 (in the longer studies). Benefit was frequently seen in the first month, and a majority of patients responded within four months (three doses). The analysis suggested that there is a group of early responders (&lt;1 month) and a smaller group who respond later. Other analyses of multiple studies showed that omalizumab improved sleep beginning after the first dose and provided substantial improvements in quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-treatment-of-refractory-symptoms/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3933520678\"><span class=\"h3\">Safety</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The safety and adverse effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omalizumab</a> are discussed separately.

In addition, 11 of 17 initial nonresponders responded after an additional four weeks of open-label treatment. Adverse effects were common in this study (29 of 30 subjects) and most commonly involved paresthesias, gastrointestinal symptoms, and headache. All 30 patients in this study had positive autologous serum skin tests (ASSTs), although other studies have found no correlation between ASSTs and cyclosporine response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-treatment-of-refractory-symptoms/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another randomized trial evaluated the effects of adding <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetirizine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetirizine</a> in 99 patients with CU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-treatment-of-refractory-symptoms/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].

All subjects were treated with cetirizine daily, plus either cyclosporine for 16 weeks, cyclosporine for 8 weeks followed by placebo for 8 weeks, or placebo for all 16 weeks.

Serum levels may be followed to ensure that the dose is not excessive, although the optimal therapeutic level for CU has not been defined. In our experience, drug levels of calcineurin inhibitors have a poor correlation with overall effectiveness, and therefore, we do not pursue a specific target drug level. Anecdotally, clinicians have noticed that the efficacy of cyclosporine and other calcineurin inhibitors may be reduced after multiple courses, but there are no data to support or refute this observation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h4\">Tacrolimus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Experience with the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> in CU is limited.

There was no placebo group. Subjects in both treatment groups had statistically and clinically significant improvement, with greater improvement in the UV-B group, and the authors noted that most responders had continued benefit for up to one year. However, very few patients had complete control of hives, and adverse effects included tanning and xerosis of the skin. In addition, the mean immunoglobulin E (IgE) was quite high in this population of patients from India (403 to 721 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL),</span> raising questions regarding the generalizability of the findings. Phototherapy is a reasonable option for patients able to commit to frequent visits or for those intolerant to systemic medications. Skin that is directly irradiated improves most dramatically, suggesting local mediators and cells as primary targets.

The most effective combination of antihistamines and the lowest possible dose of glucocorticoids for that patient should be continued while trials of other agents are conducted. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no standardized approach to the management of severe refractory CU, and therapy must be individualized. With the exception of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omalizumab</a>, the effectiveness of the other therapies discussed in this review is supported by low-quality evidence, and the approach presented is largely based upon clinical experience.

Studies directly comparing omalizumab with other therapies for refractory CU are lacking. (See <a href=\"#H22592681\" class=\"local\">'Omalizumab'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with CU who have significant symptoms despite maximal doses of nonsedating H1 antihistamines in combination with other standard therapies, we suggest adding <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omalizumab</a> therapy over other anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressant drugs, with the understanding that the cost of this medication may be prohibitive in many settings (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1920133\" class=\"local\">'Choice of initial intervention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omalizumab</a> is not effective or not available, we choose the next therapy based upon whether or not the patient has had significant glucocorticoid exposure and resultant toxicity:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients <strong>without</strong> evidence of glucocorticoid toxicity, we suggest one of the anti-inflammatory agents (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a>) in preference of other drugs as an initial intervention (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
