An aneurysm is defined as ruptured when bleeding is present outside of the wall of the aneurysm. Elective aneurysm repair is associated with low rates of morbidity and mortality in properly selected individuals, but in spite of advances in intensive care unit management and techniques for repair, mortality following repair of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (ruptured AAA) remains high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-ruptured-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Surgical outcomes may be improved using endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), but aortic endografting under emergency circumstances presents many challenges. Increasing numbers of institutions have initiated protocols for endovascular repair of ruptured AAA with promising results in small series, but not all institutions are equipped to treat all ruptured AAAs using minimally-invasive technology. However, transfer of the patient with ruptured AAA may be associated with increased mortality (17 to 19 percent) compared with those who undergo repair at the institution where they present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-ruptured-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. </p><p>Specific considerations for the surgical and endovascular repair of emergent AAA repair will be reviewed here. General techniques for AAA repair are discussed elsewhere. The diagnosis and management of AAA and ruptured AAA are discussed in separate topic reviews. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endovascular-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=open-surgical-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Open surgical repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-asymptomatic-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm#H611107773\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of asymptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Introduction'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-symptomatic-non-ruptured-and-ruptured-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm#H53322839\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of symptomatic (non-ruptured) and ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Introduction'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H108751558\"><span class=\"h1\">OPEN SURGICAL VERSUS ENDOVASCULAR REPAIR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Significant differences in mortality rates for open compared with endovascular repair for ruptured aneurysm have not been definitively demonstrated. There is some evidence to suggest that perioperative (30 day) outcomes for endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) following ruptured AAA (abdominal aortic aneurysm) may be better than for open AAA repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-ruptured-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/4-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-12</a>]. Thus, for patients with multiple risk factors for a poor prognosis following open surgical repair, and anatomy suitable for an endovascular approach, we suggest an attempt at EVAR, provided appropriately experienced personnel and equipment are available. However, as promising as EVAR may be for the treatment of ruptured AAA, logistical and practical barriers need to be overcome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-symptomatic-non-ruptured-and-ruptured-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm#H933044413\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of symptomatic (non-ruptured) and ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Decision for patient transfer'</a>.) </p><p>The main criticism of observational studies, which have associated endovascular repair with lower mortality, is that hemodynamically stable patients with ruptured AAA are more often selected for EVAR, and hemodynamically unstable patients tend to get treated with open repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-ruptured-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/1,5,6,11,13-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,6,11,13-24</a>]. Some have suggested that such patient selection biases the comparison, and that the mortality rate for EVAR and open repair for ruptured AAA are actually similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-ruptured-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In support of this idea was a comparison of morphologic variables among 458 patients in the IMPROVE trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-ruptured-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/11,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,26,27</a>] (discussed below) who underwent open or endovascular repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-ruptured-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Short aneurysm neck adversely affected mortality after open repair of ruptured AAA (an exclusion criteria for EVAR), which may help explain why observational studies, and not randomized trials (discussed in the next paragraph) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-ruptured-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/11,23,26,27,29-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,23,26,27,29-33</a>], show an early survival benefit. </p><p>A meta-analysis that included four trials found no difference in perioperative (30-day) mortality comparing endovascular with open repair for ruptured AAA (odds ratio [OR] 0.88, 95% CI 0.66-1.16) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-ruptured-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. For complications including myocardial infarction, renal complications, and respiratory failure, no differences were seen, though the quality of the evidence was low. Endovascular repair may reduce the incidence of bowel ischemia, but very few events were reported (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.14-0.94). Six-month mortality was likewise no different (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.40-1.98). </p><p>The largest of these was a multicenter trial, the Immediate Management of the Patient with Rupture: Open versus Endovascular Repair (IMPROVE) Trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-ruptured-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/11,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,26,27</a>]. The trial, which used a &quot;real-world&quot; study design, randomly assigned 613 patients with suspected ruptured AAA (based upon clinical history or examination but prior to definitive imaging) to open repair or EVAR. Patients assigned to a particular group underwent the assigned treatment, underwent the other treatment, or did not undergo either treatment due to death prior to repair or establishment of an alternative diagnosis. As assigned, no difference in perioperative (30-day) mortality was seen between the groups. As treated, the mortality for patients who underwent EVAR was 25 percent compared with 38 percent for those who underwent open repair. Patients assigned to EVAR were significantly more likely to be discharged directly to home compared with those assigned to open repair (94 versus 77 percent). At one-year follow-up, all-cause mortality rates were also not significantly different for endovascular compared with open surgical repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-ruptured-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>The IMPROVE trial shows that for patients suspected but not proven to have ruptured AAA, an open surgical or endovascular strategy for repair may be equally valid. However, most facilities in developed countries will, at a minimum, be able to exclude other confounding diagnoses (present in 8.9 percent of the patients in this study) given the general availability of computed tomography (CT). Where this is not possible, transfer to a facility that can perform either type of AAA repair seems prudent. The determination of anatomic suitability for EVAR may be best determined at the treating facility. Although this determination is commonly made preoperatively using multidetector CT, intraoperative aortography as part of an &quot;EVAR first&quot; protocol is an alternative approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-ruptured-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-symptomatic-non-ruptured-and-ruptured-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm#H933044413\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of symptomatic (non-ruptured) and ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Decision for patient transfer'</a> and <a href=\"#H108749259\" class=\"local\">'Endovascular repair'</a> below.)</p><p>Although mortality rates associated with open versus endovascular repair of ruptured AAA may be disputed, perioperative morbidity rates have been consistently lower for EVAR compared with open repair in randomized trials of elective AAA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-ruptured-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/35-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-40</a>]. Extrapolating from these results, it seems that EVAR would be highly desirable in patients with ruptured AAA who have poor prognostic factors for open repair. The apparent advantage of EVAR in the setting of ruptured AAA likely relates to its minimally invasive nature, which minimizes physiologic stress and decreases the risk of subsequent cardiovascular, pulmonary, and renal morbidity. </p><p>Although attempts have been made to quantify the risk of mortality with ruptured AAA, no variable or classification has proven reliable for predicting mortality with certainty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-ruptured-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Factors on admission that have been associated with increased mortality following open repair of ruptured AAA are discussed elsewhere.

Up to 50 percent of patients with ruptured AAA do not have anatomy suitable for endovascular aneurysm repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-ruptured-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Aortic anatomy, aortic measurements, and criteria for elective endovascular graft placement are reviewed in detail elsewhere.

Endograft placement that seals the rupture may serve as a temporizing measure allowing time for the patient to be resuscitated, delaying the need for open repair. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H273857034\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endovascular repair is contraindicated in the circumstances listed below. These contraindications (absolute and relative) are discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endovascular-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm#H440175\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Anatomic suitability'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endovascular-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm#H25900007\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Contraindications'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An aortic neck diameter more than 32 mm at the renal arteries should <strong>not</strong> be treated with endovascular aneurysm repair (elective or emergent). The largest available endograft is 36 mm in diameter (Zenith) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F67461\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67461 \">table 1</a>). With 10 percent over-sizing as recommended by most endograft manufacturers, an aortic neck diameter more than 32 mm will not have an adequate proximal seal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endovascular-devices-for-abdominal-aortic-repair\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endovascular devices for abdominal aortic repair&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A ruptured AAA with an aortic neck length &lt;7 mm should <strong>not</strong> be treated with EVAR, as this is the shortest neck length that can be treated by any device that is approved in the United States (Ovation, Trivascular, Santa Rosa, CA) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F67461\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67461 \">table 1</a>). At least 15 mm of undilated aorta (ie, aortic neck) below the renal arteries is ideal to achieve an adequate seal between the endograft and aortic neck; between 7 and 10 mm is the minimum neck length, depending upon the amount of aortic neck angulation that is present. When neck angulation is more than 30 degrees, a longer neck length should be present to provide an adequate proximal endograft seal. Adherence to these criteria may help reduce the incidence of endoleak.

The patient should have at least 10 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), and Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) or similar products (eg, PF24) available for transfusion. The blood bank should be alerted to the potential need for massive transfusion. Similar to trauma patients with severe ongoing hemorrhage, patients with ruptured AAA who require massive transfusion may benefit from a pRBC to FFP ratio &le;2:1 rather than higher ratios [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-ruptured-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

Pain control is an important part of management. It is important to keep the patient comfortable, but consciousness should be maintained. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypovolemia-or-hypovolemic-shock-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypovolemia or hypovolemic shock in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pain-control-in-the-critically-ill-adult-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pain control in the critically ill adult patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended prior to the placement of prosthetic material (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F87206\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87206 \">table 2</a>).

For patients undergoing endovascular repair, local anesthetic is generally adequate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-open-abdominal-aortic-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for open abdominal aortic surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Regardless of whether open or endovascular repair is performed, we prepare the patient from the chest to the knees. Access to the abdomen may be needed if EVAR becomes complicated or is unsuccessful, necessitating conversion to an open procedure. Access to the groin is necessary for EVAR, and may be needed for femoral thromboembolectomy during open surgery. The patient should be prepared and draped prior to induction of general anesthesia. The surgical team should be ready to make the abdominal incision immediately after induction in anticipation of hemodynamic collapse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H108749217\"><span class=\"h1\">OPEN SURGICAL REPAIR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Open surgical repair of ruptured AAA is similar to elective AAA repair with modifications in technique that reflect the urgency of the repair and the pathophysiology of rupture. The discussion below is focused on the essential differences. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=open-surgical-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Open surgical repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H108749224\"><span class=\"h2\">Incision</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Open surgical AAA repair can be performed through a midline abdominal or left retroperitoneal incision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-ruptured-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. For infrarenal ruptured AAA, a midline approach is preferred because it is expedient and exposure of the right iliac artery is better, which is important if an iliac aneurysm is present or there are signs of thromboembolism on that side. In patients who are known to have a ruptured juxtarenal aneurysm, a retroperitoneal approach may provide better proximal exposure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=open-surgical-repair-of-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm#H365977605\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Open surgical repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Incision and aortic exposure'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H108749231\"><span class=\"h2\">Aortic control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first priority after entering the abdomen should be control of hemorrhage. Bleeding from the rupture site can usually be controlled with direct pressure (manual or sponge stick) prior to aortic clamping. Direct pressure allows filling of the heart and facilitates resuscitative efforts by the anesthesia staff. The location of initial aortic clamping depends upon the location of the rupture and retroperitoneal hematoma. Opening a pararenal hematoma without adequate vascular control can result in hemorrhage that may be difficult to control, and although some surgeons may enter a pararenal retroperitoneal hematoma directly, we suggest controlling the aorta using a supraceliac aortic clamp prior to entering the hematoma. When the hematoma is located in the mid- to distal aorta, the infrarenal aorta can often be clamped without the need for supraceliac clamping. If there is any question, we suggest placing a suprarenal clamp, having it ready to clamp should it become necessary. </p><p>To perform supraceliac clamping, an incision should be made up to the xiphoid process and the patient placed in reverse Trendelenberg position. The left triangular ligament attaching the left lobe of the liver to the diaphragm should be divided and the lesser sac can be entered by dividing the gastrohepatic ligament. Exposure of the supraceliac aorta is facilitated by retraction of the rib cage using a self-retraining retractor (eg, Thompson, Bookwalter, upper hand). The aorta is then palpated and the medial and lateral aspects of the aorta are cleared to the spine using finger dissection. The right crus of the diaphragm should be divided with electrocautery to aid exposure. A long aortic clamp is then placed on the aorta and closed to the degree that is needed to control bleeding from the aortic rupture site. Supraceliac aortic clamping can often be accomplished in less than five minutes, but may take longer. Once the supraceliac clamp is in place, it is usually necessary to adjust the retractors to facilitate exposure of the infrarenal aorta. </p><p>In hemodynamically stable patients with an infrarenal rupture, it may be possible to open the retroperitoneum, dissect the infrarenal aorta, and obtain aortic control below the renal arteries without closing the supraceliac clamp. Once the aorta is controlled at the level of the renal arteries, the supraceliac clamp, if closed, can be opened to minimize visceral ischemia. Prolonged supraceliac aortic clamping &gt;30 minutes significantly increases morbidity due to hepatic, mesenteric, and renal ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-ruptured-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H108749287\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below and <a href=\"#H108753418\" class=\"local\">'Mortality'</a> below.)</p><p>Once vascular control is achieved, aortic replacement proceeds in a manner similar to elective open abdominal aortic aneurysm repair with a tube or bifurcated graft (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F56289\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56289 \">figure 1</a>). If the aortic neck is short, it may be necessary to perform the proximal anastomosis with the supraceliac clamp in place, releasing the supraceliac clamp after the proximal aortic graft has been clamped. Once the graft is in place, the aneurysm sac and retroperitoneal tissues should be reapproximated over the graft to cover the proximal and distal suture lines to minimize the potential for aortoenteric fistula. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aortoenteric-fistula-recognition-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aortoenteric fistula: Recognition and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H108749238\"><span class=\"h2\">Heparinization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heparin is commonly administered during the course of elective AAA repair, but we prefer to administer heparin on a case-by-case basis during repair of ruptured AAA.

However, in patients with obvious coagulopathy, those at risk for coagulopathy (eg, massive transfusion), or in patients for whom supraceliac clamping was prolonged, proceeding without anticoagulation is an acceptable option.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H108749245\"><span class=\"h2\">Handling the inferior mesenteric artery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Colonic ischemia is commonly observed following ruptured AAA with approximately 35 percent of ruptured AAA patients suffering some degree of ischemia, an incidence that is higher compared with elective AAA repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-ruptured-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. We prefer to reimplant the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) into the distal aortic graft, whenever possible, to minimize the potential for colonic ischemia, unless backbleeding from the IMA orifice within the aneurysm sac is vigorous, indicating adequate collateral flow, or the vessel is occluded (no backbleeding). However, because reimplantation of the IMA prolongs the operation, the IMA is reimplanted less frequently for ruptured AAA than with elective AAA repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-ruptured-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/41,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,48</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H108749252\"><span class=\"h2\">Thromboembolectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In our experience, thromboembolism is also a more common sequela of ruptured AAA compared with elective aneurysm repair. All aortic aneurysms have some degree of mural thrombus and cholesterol plaque, which have the potential to dislodge and embolize during the course of aortic dissection and clamping. Fresh thrombus can also form in situ in the iliac and femoral arteries in patients who have not been anticoagulated. Diminished backbleeding from the iliac arteries just prior to the completion of the distal anastomosis should prompt Fogarty catheter embolectomy. &#160;</p><p>Distal perfusion should be assessed by palpating the pedal vessels or by using a handheld Doppler prior to removing the surgical drapes and comparing the quality of the pulse or Doppler signal with the preoperative examination. If the distal pulses are absent or diminished by comparison, embolization to the infrainguinal vessels may have occurred and embolectomy is indicated. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H108749259\"><span class=\"h1\">ENDOVASCULAR REPAIR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endovascular repair of ruptured AAA is limited to endovascular centers with a defined program for emergency endovascular surgery. Some centers have adapted an &quot;EVAR first&quot; approach to ruptured AAA, in which endovascular repair is attempted first and conversion to an open repair is made if the attempted EVAR is not successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-ruptured-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/15,35,49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,35,49,50</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H519610139\"><span class=\"h2\">Aortic control and graft placement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endovascular repair is largely limited to patients who remain hemodynamically stable, most of whom will have undergone computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis prior to consideration for EVAR to determine the anatomic suitability of EVAR.

Bleeding from the aortic rupture site can be controlled using an aortic occlusion balloon that is advanced through the femoral access site to the area of aortic rupture and stabilized with a long sheath [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-ruptured-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/51-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-57</a>]. Once the balloon is inflated, the patient should be fluid-resuscitated by the anesthesia staff. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endovascular-methods-for-aortic-control-in-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endovascular methods for aortic control in trauma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An aortogram below the level of the aortic occlusion balloon should be performed to evaluate the diameter, length and morphology of the aorta to determine if endovascular repair is possible. Alternatively, the aorta can be imaged using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), if available. Once it has been determined that endovascular repair is appropriate, endograft positioning and deployment proceed in a manner that is similar to elective endovascular aneurysm repair. For infrarenal aortic rupture, the balloon should be repositioned just distal to the renal arteries to preserve renal blood flow while the device is positioned and deployed. Intermittent deflation of the balloon may be required during the course of endograft placement.

Although reasonable efforts should be made to minimize the volume of contrast used during the procedure, it is important to get an adequate final study demonstrating that <strong>no</strong> endoleaks are present. As with elective repair, type I and type III endoleaks are repaired when identified. During elective EVAR, type II endoleak (backbleeding into the aneurysm sac) can be observed initially since the majority will resolve over time. However, following endovascular repair for ruptured AAA, type II endoleak will <strong>not</strong> tamponade spontaneously, and thus, when type II endoleak is identified, open surgical ligation of the backbleeding vessel is necessary.

It is common to have some degree of postoperative renal dysfunction following ruptured AAA, and thus, imaging in the immediate postoperative period using intravenous contrast should be limited to concerns for bleeding or other ongoing abdominal pathology such as intraabdominal infection or suspected ischemic bowel. Following EVAR, computed tomography should be performed to evaluate the endograft once renal function has stabilized. Thereafter, follow-up is similar to elective aneurysm repair.

Late complications such as aortic graft infection, aortoenteric fistula, and graft occlusion do not appear to be significantly different between ruptured and elective aneurysm repair.

Conversion of EVAR to open repair is generally associated with higher mortality rates compared with primary open repair. There are no comparable studies for ruptured AAA. In one study of elective EVAR, early conversion to open surgery was associated with a mortality rate of 12.4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-ruptured-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>], which contrasts to the approximately 3 percent mortality for the initial AAA repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-ruptured-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

ACS can occur as a sequela of open or endovascular repair of ruptured AAA. In a systematic review of endovascular repair of ruptured AAA, the pooled incidence of abdominal compartment syndrome was 8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-ruptured-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].

Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) has the potential to minimize these variable complications and may improve survival following ruptured AAA, but this has not been definitively established. In one review, open surgery was an independent risk for perioperative (30 day) death compared with endovascular repair for both hemodynamically unstable patients (odds ratio [OR] 1.74, 95% CI, 1.16 to 2.62) and hemodynamically stable patients (OR 1.64, 95% CI, 1.10-2.43) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-and-endovascular-repair-of-ruptured-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].

In spite of improvements in prehospital, operative and postoperative care, mortality following repair of ruptured AAA has not improved. Of patients who survive long enough to be treated, about 40 to 50 percent survive their repair, resulting in an overall survival of less than 25 percent. (See <a href=\"#H108749055\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H108753418\" class=\"local\">'Mortality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with ruptured AAA, where appropriate facilities, personnel, equipment, and expertise are available for endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), we suggest EVAR rather than open AAA repair, provided it is anatomically feasible (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Although significant differences in mortality rates for open compared with endovascular repair for ruptured aneurysm have not been demonstrated in randomized trials, perioperative morbidity for endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) appears to be lower compared with open repair, though there may be a selection bias in the available studies. (See <a href=\"#H108751558\" class=\"local\">'Open surgical versus endovascular repair'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As promising as EVAR appears to be for the treatment of ruptured AAA, logistical and practical barriers need to be overcome to uniformly offer EVAR for repair of ruptured AAA. Thus, ruptured AAA is often repaired with open surgical techniques, particularly in smaller hospitals, due to the limited number of centers capable of performing urgent or emergent EVAR. For hemodynamically stable patients with ruptured AAA who are poor candidates for open surgical repair, transfer to a vascular center is appropriate for possible EVAR, and for the recognized benefits of repair of ruptured AAA when performed at a tertiary center. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-symptomatic-non-ruptured-and-ruptured-abdominal-aortic-aneurysm#H933044413\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of symptomatic (non-ruptured) and ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm&quot;, section on 'Decision for patient transfer'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repair of ruptured AAA using an open or endovascular approach is similar to elective AAA repair with modifications in technique that reflect the urgency of the repair and the pathophysiology of rupture. Endovascular repair is largely limited to patients with ruptured AAA who remain hemodynamically stable, most of whom will have undergone computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis to determine the anatomic suitability for EVAR. However, feasibility for EVAR can be determined intraoperatively in hemodynamically unstable patients. An aortic neck diameter more than 32 mm at the renal arteries, or an aortic neck length less than 5 mm contraindicate endovascular repair. If endovascular repair is feasible, endograft positioning and deployment proceeds in a manner that is similar to elective endovascular aneurysm repair. If not, an abdominal incision is made and open surgical repair is undertaken.
