They have diverse electrophysiologic properties and are therefore of variable antiarrhythmic efficacy. The primary settings in which they are useful can be best appreciated from an understanding of their mechanism of action.</p><p>This topic will review the electrophysiological properties of calcium channel blockers and their clinical indications in a variety of arrhythmias. More detailed discussions of their use in specific arrhythmias and other treatment options for arrhythmias are presented separately.

The sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes depend upon calcium currents to generate slowly propagating action potentials. In contrast, fast response myocardial tissues (the atria, specialized infranodal conducting system, the ventricles, and accessory pathways) depend upon sodium channel currents. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myocardial-action-potential-and-action-of-antiarrhythmic-drugs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myocardial action potential and action of antiarrhythmic drugs&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Certain disorders, such as an acute myocardial infarction, may convert tissue generating a fast action potential, including ventricular myocardium and Purkinje fibers, into tissue that generates a slow action potential. In an animal model, low doses of mibefradil, a T-type CCB with weak effects on the L-type calcium channel, prevented the reduction in the ventricular fibrillation threshold with ischemia, without depressing left ventricular contractility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blockers-in-the-treatment-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Higher doses of both mibefradil and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> prevented ischemic and reperfusion arrhythmias, an effect associated with depression of left ventricular contractility. It is not clear, however, if CCBs are clinically useful in these settings. Furthermore, mibefradil has been withdrawn from the US market because of toxicity, and it is not known if other T-type calcium channel blockers will be developed.</p><p>Calcium channel blockers block the slow calcium channel in a dose-dependent fashion, resulting in the following direct effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blockers-in-the-treatment-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Slowing of phase 4 depolarization and the conduction velocity of the sinoatrial (SA) and atrioventricular (AV) nodes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lengthening the antegrade and retrograde refractory periods of the AV node</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Slowing of the sinus rate and increased PR interval on the electrocardiogram (ECG) via the slowing of conduction through the AV node</p><p/><p>Similar to sodium channel blockers, CCBs with antiarrhythmic activity (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a>) exhibit &quot;use-dependence.&quot; This phenomenon is characterized by an increase in the extent of calcium channel blockade as the frequency of impulse generation and ventricular activation increases. CCBs can also cause significant peripheral vasodilation, an effect which can induce reflex activation of the sympathetic nervous system. As a result, the observed electropharmacologic and pharmacodynamic effects of CCBs represent a combination of direct and sympathetic reflex actions. This is particularly important with most dihydropyridines (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nifedipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nifedipine</a>), which are potent vasodilators and sympathetic activators. The serum concentration of dihydropyridine CCBs necessary to achieve electrophysiologic activity in humans is much higher than the concentration needed to induce potent vasodilation. Therefore, these agents do not exert measurable electrophysiologic effects and appear to be devoid of antiarrhythmic activity. In addition, the reflex activation of the sympathetic nervous system offsets any direct effect of the dihydropyridine CCBs on the sinoatrial and AV nodes. Among nondihydropyridine CCBs, the effect on vasodilation is also more apparent with diltiazem than verapamil, which results in verapamil having a more pronounced effect on the SA and AV nodes as its action is not offset by vasodilatory activation of sympathetic activity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL USE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a> primarily affect slow response tissues in the SA and AV nodes, these medications are primarily used for the management of supraventricular tachycardias that require the AV node for their existence (ie, atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia and atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia) and for ventricular rate control in atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and atrial tachycardia. They play a much more limited role in the treatment of ventricular arrhythmias as they are largely ineffective for direct prevention of ventricular arrhythmia. However, there are some exceptions, such as the utility of verapamil for the treatment of idiopathic left ventricular tachycardia, also known as fascicular tachycardia. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Ventricular arrhythmia'</a> below.)</p><p>The antiarrhythmic effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> appears to be similar in adults and children, although less experience is available in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blockers-in-the-treatment-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/1,2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,6</a>]. Verapamil and to a lesser degree <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a> may be harmful in patients with hypotension or impaired ventricular function (especially those with a history of heart failure), and in general should not be used in patients with these conditions. In addition, CCBs should be used cautiously in patients already taking a beta blocker because of the combined negative inotropic and chronotropic effects of both classes of medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blockers-in-the-treatment-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>A brief review of these issues is provided here; the use of calcium channel blockers in the treatment of specific arrhythmias is discussed in detail elsewhere.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Supraventricular tachycardia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of supraventricular tachycardia (AV nodal reentrant and atrioventricular reentrant due to an accessory pathway) involves two steps: acute conversion of the arrhythmia to normal sinus rhythm (usually by intravenous drug administration); and prevention of recurrences.</p><p>Both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> have been accepted as treatments of choice for the termination of supraventricular tachycardia. An important exception to the first-line use of these agents occurs in unstable patients with hemodynamic compromise. In an unstable patient with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), the preferred treatment is direct electrical cardioversion or intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a>, a very short-acting AV nodal blocking agent which rarely produces additional hypotension. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrioventricular-nodal-reentrant-tachycardia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Another situation in which calcium channel blockers should be avoided or used with caution is in the presence of a wide QRS complex tachycardia. When there is no doubt that the wide QRS complex tachycardia is a supraventricular tachycardia, therapy directed at the AV node and the SVT may be given. In such cases, management is similar to that described above for SVT with a normal QRS duration. However, with a wide QRS complex tachycardia that is potentially ventricular tachycardia, calcium channel blockers should be avoided, as there is a risk for hemodynamic deterioration following the administration of these medications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wide-qrs-complex-tachycardias-approach-to-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wide QRS complex tachycardias: Approach to management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Calcium channel blockers appear to be of limited value in other forms of reentrant and automatic supraventricular tachycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blockers-in-the-treatment-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/2,3,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,6,7</a>]. Limited data exist concerning their role in SA nodal reentrant tachycardia or in atrial tachycardia due to an ectopic focus or intraatrial reentry (except for rate control by AV nodal blockade). However, oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> may convert paroxysmal atrial tachycardia with block to sinus rhythm under certain circumstances, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> toxicity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Multifocal atrial tachycardia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Verapamil</a> or a beta blocker is usually the treatment of choice for multifocal atrial tachycardia. Verapamil impairs AV nodal conduction and will therefore slow the ventricular rate in this disorder; it does not usually reverse or prevent this arrhythmia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multifocal-atrial-tachycardia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multifocal atrial tachycardia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Atrial fibrillation and flutter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Verapamil</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a> are used both acutely (via the intravenous route) and chronically (via the oral route) to slow the ventricular response in atrial fibrillation (AF) and atrial flutter. Their efficacy for rate control is due to their direct action to slow conduction and prolonged refractoriness in the AV node. Verapamil and diltiazem reduce both the resting and the exercise-induced increases in heart rate, whereas the major effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> (which works on the AV node via enhancing vagal tone) is on the resting rate. Therefore, verapamil and diltiazem are generally preferred to digoxin as monotherapy (in the absence of underlying heart failure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/calcium-channel-blockers-in-the-treatment-of-cardiac-arrhythmias/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, for patients with inadequate ventricular rate control with monotherapy, the concurrent use of digoxin or a beta blocker with verapamil or diltiazem has an additive depressant effect on the AV node. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-fibrillation-pharmacologic-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of ventricular rate in atrial fibrillation: Pharmacologic therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-ventricular-rate-in-atrial-flutter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of ventricular rate in atrial flutter&quot;</a>.)</p><p>AV nodal blocking medications that are normally used to control the ventricular rate during AF (most importantly) or atrial flutter, including the CCBs <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a>, are contraindicated in patients with an accessory pathway and preexcitation.
