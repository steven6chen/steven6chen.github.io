It represents an obstetric emergency. Few shoulder dystocias can be anticipated and prevented, as most occur in the absence of risk factors. Therefore, the obstetrician must be prepared to recognize a shoulder dystocia immediately and proceed through an orderly sequence of steps to affect delivery in a timely manner. The goal of management is to prevent fetal asphyxia and permanent Erb's palsy or death, while avoiding physical injury (eg, bone fractures, maternal trauma), but the latter are acceptable if needed to prevent permanent injury in the child.</p><p>Intrapartum diagnosis and management of shoulder dystocia will be reviewed here. Risk factors for shoulder dystocia and planning delivery of pregnancies at high risk are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=shoulder-dystocia-risk-factors-and-planning-delivery-of-high-risk-pregnancies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Shoulder dystocia: Risk factors and planning delivery of high-risk pregnancies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The fetal bisacromial diameter (the distance between the outermost parts of the fetal shoulders) normally enters the pelvis at an oblique angle with the posterior shoulder ahead of the anterior one, rotating to the anterior-posterior position at the pelvic outlet with external rotation of the fetal head. The anterior shoulder can then slide under the symphysis pubis for delivery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F52812\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52812 \">figure 1</a>). If the fetal shoulders remain in an anterior-posterior position during descent or descend simultaneously rather than sequentially into the pelvic inlet, then the anterior shoulder can become impacted behind the symphysis pubis; the posterior shoulder may be obstructed by the sacral promontory. Anterior obstruction is more common than posterior obstruction. If descent of the fetal head continues while the anterior or posterior shoulder remains impacted, then stretching of the nerves in the brachial plexus may occur and may result in nerve injury.</p><p>It is hypothesized that the fetal trunk fails to rotate to an oblique position because of increased resistance between the fetal skin and vaginal walls or a large fetal chest relative to the biparietal diameter, which may occur with macrosomia, or because of rapid fetal descent, which may occur with precipitous labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-intrapartum-diagnosis-management-and-outcome/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Neonatal injuries diagnosed at birth may be caused by prenatal, as well as intrapartum, events. Labor and the impacted shoulder itself or the provider's attempt to deliver the infant may result in traumatic injury. Umbilical cord compression, compression of fetal neck vessels leading to cerebral venous obstruction, excessive vagal stimulation and bradycardia, or a combination of factors may result in asphyxia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-intrapartum-diagnosis-management-and-outcome/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2159030231\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Shoulder dystocia occurs in 0.2 to 3 percent of births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-intrapartum-diagnosis-management-and-outcome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The wide variation is due to differences in the prevalence of macrosomia and diabetes among study populations and to the subjective nature of the diagnosis, which is based on the provider's assessment of the difficulty of the delivery. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Shoulder dystocia is a subjective clinical diagnosis. It should be suspected when the fetal head retracts into the perineum (ie, turtle sign) after expulsion due to reverse traction from the shoulders being impacted at the pelvic inlet. The diagnosis is made when the routine practice of gentle, downward traction of the fetal head fails to accomplish delivery of the anterior shoulder.</p><p>A more objective definition, such as one based upon time to delivery, would be more useful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-intrapartum-diagnosis-management-and-outcome/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. One group attempted to devise objective criteria for diagnosis of shoulder by first determining the mean interval from delivery of the head to expulsion of the body in 210 patients who did not undergo any ancillary obstetrical maneuvers (eg, McRoberts position, delivery of the posterior arm, suprapubic pressure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-intrapartum-diagnosis-management-and-outcome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The upper limit of normal for head-to-body delivery time was considered to be two standard deviations above this mean value (24 seconds) or 60 seconds. A subsequent prospective series by the same group found that deliveries complicated by a head-to-body expulsion time greater than 60 seconds or use of ancillary maneuvers to effect delivery described a subpopulation of infants who had higher birth weight, lower one-minute Apgar scores, and a greater prevalence of birth injury than infants who did not meet either of these criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-intrapartum-diagnosis-management-and-outcome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Of interest, only 24 of the 99 cases of objectively defined shoulder dystocia were reported as shoulder dystocia by the clinician, even though ancillary maneuvers were used to effect delivery in 46 cases. This discrepancy illustrates the difficulty in collecting and analyzing data for a condition that is subjectively determined. Although the time interval between delivery of the fetal head and complete expulsion of the fetus is an objective measure, it is not routinely measured and would require a change in standard practice. Further research is needed to determine an objective, clinically relevant, practical definition of shoulder dystocia. </p><p>Severity of shoulder dystocia is also subjective and decided retrospectively based on need for multiple maneuvers to effect delivery and whether or not the fetus <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the mother sustained injury as a result.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2745359204\"><span class=\"h2\">General principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Shoulder dystocia is an obstetric emergency. The goal of management is to safely effect delivery of the infant before asphyxia and cortical injury occur from umbilical cord compression and impeded inspiration, and without causing peripheral neurologic injury or other fetal or maternal trauma. </p><p>Most interventions are intended to disimpact the anterior shoulder from behind the symphysis pubis by rotating the fetal trunk or delivering the posterior arm and shoulder. In general, the operator has up to five minutes to deliver a previously well-oxygenated term infant before an increased risk of asphyxial injury occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-intrapartum-diagnosis-management-and-outcome/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. The mean umbilical artery pH at term is 7.27; in two studies, umbilical artery pH was estimated to fall 0.01 and 0.04 pH units per minute, respectively, in the interval between delivery of the fetal head and trunk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-intrapartum-diagnosis-management-and-outcome/abstract/9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11</a>]. However, in practice, there is a poor correlation between the head-to-body delivery interval and pH, pCO2, base deficit, neonatal encephalopathy, or death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-intrapartum-diagnosis-management-and-outcome/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=umbilical-cord-blood-acid-base-analysis-at-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Umbilical cord blood acid-base analysis at delivery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The occurrence of shoulder dystocia cannot be accurately predicted on the basis of antenatal or intrapartum risk factors, and thus it and its associated complications cannot be consistently avoided (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=shoulder-dystocia-risk-factors-and-planning-delivery-of-high-risk-pregnancies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Shoulder dystocia: Risk factors and planning delivery of high-risk pregnancies&quot;</a>). Therefore, the clinician should be prepared for possible shoulder dystocia in all vaginal deliveries, be cognizant of the various procedures that have been shown to be effective for delivering the impacted shoulders, and have a step-wise plan of action, which allows expeditious execution of diagnosis and treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial steps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When shoulder dystocia is suspected, the gravida and labor room personnel should be given instructions in a clear and calm manner.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nursing, anesthesia, obstetric, and pediatric staff should be called to the labor room, if not already available, to provide assistance as needed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient should be positioned with her buttocks flush with the edge of the bed to provide optimal access for executing maneuvers to affect delivery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mother should be told <strong>not</strong> to push while preparations are made and maneuvers are undertaken to reposition the fetus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive downward traction, greater than usual head and neck traction, and fundal pressure <strong>should be avoided</strong> because this combination of maneuvers can stretch and injure the brachial plexus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-intrapartum-diagnosis-management-and-outcome/abstract/3,12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12-15</a>]. These actions also may further impact the shoulders and cause uterine rupture or other injury. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A tight nuchal cord, if present, should be released over the fetal head and left intact as umbilical blood flow helps in neonatal resuscitation and transition. Clamping and cutting the cord does not help to release the impacted shoulder. If it is necessary to extract the fetus without rupturing the cord, it should be done after the shoulder dystocia has been resolved. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Clamping and cutting the cord with the head at the perineum is potentially harmful if a Gunn-Zavanelli-O&rsquo;Leary maneuver is performed since there is no oxygen delivery to the fetus between the time the cord is clamped and cut and the time of birth via cesarean [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-intrapartum-diagnosis-management-and-outcome/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>].

If the perineum was not already adequately cut or torn with expulsion of the fetal head, cutting or extending the <span class=\"nowrap\">tear/episiotomy</span> immediately following failed downward traction with and without McRoberts and before attempting any of the vaginal maneuvers for resolution of the dystocia is a practical approach.

Some providers find it useful for a nurse to verbally note the passage of time since diagnosis in 60-second increments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H302662705\"><span class=\"h3\">Avoid forceful downward traction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although downward traction on the fetal neck is necessary to release the anterior shoulder, forceful and excessive downward traction alone should be avoided because it can increase the risk of fetal injury. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends applying axial traction in alignment with the fetal cervico-thoracic spine with a downward component along a vector no more than 45 degrees below the horizontal plane when the laboring woman is in a lithotomy position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-intrapartum-diagnosis-management-and-outcome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>The potential harm of forceful downward traction is well-accepted based on clinical experience and biologic plausibility, but published data are limited. A retrospective study reported four cases of shoulder dystocia managed with lateral traction alone: Three were associated with brachial plexus injury and one had a clavicular fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-intrapartum-diagnosis-management-and-outcome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H68133738\"><span class=\"h3\">Avoid increasing traction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians should think about whether they are applying greater than normal force to deliver the shoulders, and if they perceive this is the case, then this perception should prompt utilization of maneuvers to resolve the dystocia. After releasing the shoulder, normal traction will allow delivery of the infant.</p><p>Since further descent of the fetal shoulder is prevented by the maternal pelvic bones, maneuvers to release the impacted shoulder are needed to resolve the dystocia; increasing traction is counterproductive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-intrapartum-diagnosis-management-and-outcome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A study using force-sensing devices on 29 randomly selected vaginal births found that clinician-applied peak forces are about 47 Newtons (N) for routine deliveries, 69 N for difficult deliveries, and 100 N for shoulder dystocia deliveries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-intrapartum-diagnosis-management-and-outcome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In one case, fracture of the clavicle occurred at peak force of about 100 N, and appeared to be related to applying a high peak force quickly rather than gradually and for applying it for a prolonged period of time (over 30 seconds). However, measuring traction forces during shoulder dystocia management is not practical. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of approach</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2029749270\"><span class=\"h3\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We perform the McRoberts maneuver first without and then with suprapubic pressure as the initial approach for releasing the impacted shoulder, given that it is less invasive than other maneuvers. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'McRoberts maneuver'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3802407919\" class=\"local\">'McRoberts maneuver with suprapubic pressure'</a> below.)</p><p>If the McRoberts maneuver with suprapubic pressure is unsuccessful, we suggest delivery of the posterior arm. Some authorities suggest beginning with delivery of the posterior arm because of its high success rate, even though it is a more invasive approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-intrapartum-diagnosis-management-and-outcome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H28001966\" class=\"local\">'Delivery of the posterior arm'</a> below.)</p><p>If it is not possible to reach the elbow or forearm because the posterior arm is above the pelvic brim, we attempt to deliver the posterior shoulder via the axilla, which almost always enables resolution of the dystocia (see <a href=\"#H523783555\" class=\"local\">'Delivery of the posterior shoulder (Menticoglou maneuver)'</a> below). In the rare cases where shoulder dystocia persists at this stage, we would fracture the clavicle (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Clavicular fracture'</a> below). </p><p>The initial approach may vary depending upon the clinical situation, clinician preference, accessibility of assistants, and availability of anesthesia. For example, if the patient is severely obese, the author may omit suprapubic pressure. Or if another obstetrical provider has tried to manage a shoulder dystocia, but is unsuccessful, and the author is called to help with the emergency, he usually immediately attempts to deliver the posterior arm as this maneuver is often successful and avoids more traction on the fetal head and brachial plexus.</p><p>There are no randomized trials comparing results from use of the various maneuvers. The general consensus is that no maneuver is clearly superior for resolving the dystocia and preventing fetal brachial plexus injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-intrapartum-diagnosis-management-and-outcome/abstract/5,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,23,24</a>], as all maneuvers can increase the degree of stretch on the brachial plexus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-intrapartum-diagnosis-management-and-outcome/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>It is reasonable to attempt each maneuver a couple of times before quickly moving on to the next maneuver. As more approaches are attempted, the likelihood of success increases, but the risk of fetal injury also increases, which may reflect increasingly severe dystocia rather than use of increasingly morbid approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-intrapartum-diagnosis-management-and-outcome/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2160878503\"><span class=\"h3\">Initial group of maneuvers</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h4\">McRoberts maneuver</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest the McRoberts maneuver as the initial approach for releasing the impacted shoulder because it is less invasive than other maneuvers and often successful, in agreement with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-intrapartum-diagnosis-management-and-outcome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The McRoberts maneuver requires two assistants, each of whom grasps a maternal leg and sharply flexes the thigh back against the abdomen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F74910\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74910 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-intrapartum-diagnosis-management-and-outcome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. This procedure relieves shoulder dystocia via marked cephalad rotation of the symphysis pubis and subsequent flattening the sacrum, thus removing the sacral promontory as an obstruction site (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F58081\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58081 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-intrapartum-diagnosis-management-and-outcome/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. In addition, by bringing the pelvic inlet into the plane perpendicular to the maximum expulsive force, pushing efficiency improves significantly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-intrapartum-diagnosis-management-and-outcome/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. McRoberts maneuver does not change the actual dimensions of the maternal pelvis.</p><p>McRoberts position alone has successfully alleviated shoulder dystocia in as many as 42 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-intrapartum-diagnosis-management-and-outcome/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. There is no clear advantage to performing the maneuver before diagnosis of shoulder dystocia; however, evidence is limited as available trials are small and underpowered to detect moderate benefits from prophylactic intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-intrapartum-diagnosis-management-and-outcome/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. There is no harm in employing the maneuver prophylactically in women at high risk of shoulder dystocia.</p><p>In rare cases, excessive force or prolonged placement of the patient's legs in a hyperflexed position has led to maternal complications such as symphyseal separation, sacroiliac joint dislocation, and transient lateral femoral cutaneous neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-intrapartum-diagnosis-management-and-outcome/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3802407919\"><span class=\"h4\">McRoberts maneuver with suprapubic pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This maneuver requires use of an assistant to apply pressure suprapubically (<strong>not</strong> fundally) with the palm or fist, directing the pressure on the anterior shoulder both downward (to below the pubic bone) and laterally (toward the baby's face or sternum) in conjunction with the McRoberts maneuver (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F74910\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74910 \">figure 2</a>). Suprapubic pressure is supposed to adduct the shoulders or bring them into an oblique plane, since the oblique diameter is the widest diameter of the maternal pelvis. It is most useful in mild cases and those caused by an impacted anterior shoulder. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28001966\"><span class=\"h4\">Delivery of the posterior arm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Delivery of the posterior arm almost always relieves impaction of the anterior shoulder and resolves the dystocia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-intrapartum-diagnosis-management-and-outcome/abstract/24,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,33</a>]. It is an appropriate second maneuver if the less technically demanding and often successful McRoberts maneuver and suprapubic pressure fail [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-intrapartum-diagnosis-management-and-outcome/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The maneuver, which is best performed under adequate anesthesia, requires introducing a hand into the vagina to locate the posterior shoulder and arm. If the fetal abdomen faces the maternal right, the operator's left hand should be used; if the fetal abdomen faces the maternal left, the right hand is used. The posterior arm should be identified and followed to the elbow. If the elbow is flexed, the operator can grasp the forearm and hand and pull out the arm. If it is extended, pressure is applied in the antecubital fossa. This flexes the elbow across the fetal chest and allows the forearm or hand to be grasped. The arm is then pulled out of the vagina, which also delivers the posterior shoulder and reduces the shoulder diameter by 2 to 3 cm as the 13 cm bisacromial diameter becomes a 10 to 11 cm axilloacromial diameter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F66929\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66929 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-intrapartum-diagnosis-management-and-outcome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. If the anterior shoulder cannot be delivered at this point, the fetus can be rotated and the procedure repeated for the anterior (now posterior) arm. </p><p>The greatest risk with delivery of the posterior arm is fracture of the humerus, which has been reported in 0 to 20 percent of cases; the risk is highest when used after other maneuvers have failed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-intrapartum-diagnosis-management-and-outcome/abstract/15,34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,34-36</a>]. To minimize this risk, it is important to apply pressure at the antecubital fossa to flex the fetal forearm and then sweep it out over the infant's chest, rather than grasping and pulling directly on the fetal arm or mid-humeral shaft.</p><p>A similar procedure is followed if the arm is trapped behind the fetus. In this case, manipulation of the forearm so that it can be swept ventrally and out the vagina may involve deliberate or inadvertent fracture of the humerus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H523783555\"><span class=\"h4\">Delivery of the posterior shoulder (Menticoglou maneuver)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If it is not possible to reach the elbow or forearm because the posterior arm is above the pelvic brim, it may be possible to deliver the posterior shoulder before delivering the arm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-intrapartum-diagnosis-management-and-outcome/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>]. After an assistant gently flexes the fetal head toward the anterior shoulder, the obstetrician places <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> right middle finger into the fetus' posterior axilla from the left side of the pelvis and the left middle finger into the posterior axilla from the right side of the pelvis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F107810\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107810 \">figure 5</a>). The two middle fingers in the axilla are then used to pull the posterior shoulder downward along the curve of the sacrum. Once the shoulder has been brought down sufficiently, the posterior arm can be grasped and delivered. Pulling the posterior shoulder into the posterior pelvic space may release the anterior shoulder or allow a rotational maneuver to release the anterior shoulder. These maneuvers are associated with an increased risk of fracture, but not brachial plexus injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1556126458\"><span class=\"h3\">Secondary maneuvers</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h4\">Rubin maneuver</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Rubin maneuver causes adduction of the fetal shoulder so that the shoulders are displaced from the anteroposterior diameter of the inlet, thereby allowing the posterior arm to enter the pelvis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-intrapartum-diagnosis-management-and-outcome/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Under adequate anesthesia, the clinician places one hand in the vagina and on the back surface of the posterior fetal shoulder, and then rotates it anteriorly (towards the fetal face). If the fetal spine is on the maternal left, the operator's right hand is used; the left hand is used if the fetal spine is on the maternal right (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F62024\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62024 \">figure 6</a>). Alternatively, the Rubin maneuver can be attempted by placing a hand on the back surface of the anterior fetal shoulder, if it is more accessible.</p><p>Use of a laboratory birthing simulator showed that the Rubin maneuver required less traction force and resulted in less brachial plexus extension than the McRoberts maneuver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-intrapartum-diagnosis-management-and-outcome/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. However, it is more invasive than the McRoberts procedure and less easily performed in unanesthetized patients.</p><p>Another approach is to combine the Rubin maneuver on the back of the posterior shoulder with external suprapubic pressure on the front of the anterior shoulder in the opposite direction or with the McRoberts maneuver. Alternatively, the Rubin and Woods (see below) procedures can be combined so that one shoulder is being pushed from the back and the other shoulder is being pushed from the front in the same clockwise or counterclockwise direction. This increases the rotational force on the shoulders.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h4\">Woods screw maneuver</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Woods likened shoulder dystocia to the &quot;crossed thread&quot; of a bolt into a nut. Although a bolt cannot be forced into a nut, it goes through easily when turned repeatedly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-intrapartum-diagnosis-management-and-outcome/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The Woods screw maneuver rotates the fetus by exerting pressure on the anterior, clavicular surface of the posterior shoulder to turn the fetus until the anterior shoulder emerges from behind the maternal symphysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71838\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71838 \">figure 7</a>). If the fetal spine is on the maternal left, the operator uses the left hand to push on the clavicle of the posterior arm and rotate the baby 180 degrees in a counterclockwise direction. The fetal head and neck should not be twisted. As discussed above, the Woods and Rubin maneuvers can be combined so that one shoulder is being pushed from the front and the other shoulder is being pushed from the back in the same clockwise or counterclockwise direction. This increases the rotational force on the shoulders.</p><p>If counterclockwise rotation is unsuccessful, clockwise rotation may release the shoulder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Clavicular fracture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clavicle can be intentionally fractured to shorten the bisacromial diameter. This is done by pulling the anterior clavicle outward. However, intentional clavicular fracture can be difficult to perform and can lead to injury of underlying vascular and pulmonary structures. Nevertheless, it is less morbid than the procedures of last resort described below. (See <a href=\"#H835187232\" class=\"local\">'Procedures of last resort'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4105589204\"><span class=\"h3\">Other maneuvers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of the following maneuvers in management of shoulder dystocia is unclear. They are less well studied than the maneuvers described above, but both are supported by available evidence. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3617381137\"><span class=\"h4\">Gaskin all-fours maneuver</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This maneuver, first introduced by Ina May Gaskin, CPM, places the mother on her hands and knees [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-intrapartum-diagnosis-management-and-outcome/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>], but not in the knee-chest position. An alternative is a racing start or &quot;sprinter&quot; position. These positions increase the space in the hollow of the sacrum and take advantage of gravity, which together facilitate delivery by gentle downward traction on the posterior shoulder (the shoulder against the maternal sacrum) or upward traction on the anterior shoulder (the shoulder against the maternal symphysis). </p><p>Although not used by most obstetricians, this is one of the initial group of maneuvers used by some midwives and other clinicians, particularly for the mother in a birthing bed with no or only local or pudendal anesthesia. Some providers prefer to use it before attempting to deliver the posterior arm or shoulder since the latter require more technical expertise. Although the available literature on this maneuver is limited, it supports both the efficacy and low morbidity of this simple approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-intrapartum-diagnosis-management-and-outcome/abstract/44-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H241689318\"><span class=\"h4\">Posterior axilla sling traction (PAST)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the posterior arm and shoulder cannot be delivered by the methods described above, case reports have described successful outcomes using a sling to exert traction on the posterior shoulder. This technique may be successful when other methods fail because it eliminates the space occupied in the pelvis by the operator's fingers, but may have higher morbidity than other approaches. Until more safety data are available, we suggest reserving it for cases in which other commonly used techniques have failed. </p><p>A size 12 or 14 French soft suction catheter or urinary catheter is folded into a loop over the operator's index finger and fed through the posterior axilla until the loop can be retrieved with the operator's other index finger. The loop is then unfolded to create a sling around the posterior shoulder, the two ends of the sling are clamped, and the shoulder is delivered by applying moderate traction to the sling. The sling can also be used to rotate the shoulders through 180 degrees assisted by counter pressure on the back of the anterior shoulder. </p><p>In a series of 19 cases managed with this technique, four neonates had transient Erb's palsy and one had permanent Erb's palsy of the anterior arm, and three neonates had posterior arm humerus fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-intrapartum-diagnosis-management-and-outcome/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Five of the 19 newborns had died in utero. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H835187232\"><span class=\"h3\">Procedures of last resort</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If shoulder dystocia occurs in a labor room and cannot be resolved by the maneuvers described above, the patient should be moved to an operating room for cesarean delivery after the Gunn-Zavanelli-O&rsquo;Leary maneuver, the abdominal rescue procedure, or symphysiotomy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h4\">Gunn-Zavanelli-O'Leary maneuver</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This procedure requires replacement of the fetal head in the pelvis, followed by cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-intrapartum-diagnosis-management-and-outcome/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

Although effective, we recommend avoiding symphysiotomy unless all other maneuvers have failed and cesarean delivery is not possible. </p><p>The procedure is performed by infiltrating the skin over the symphysis pubis and fibrocartilaginous area with local anesthetic. The urethra is displaced laterally using the index and middle fingers placed against the posterior aspect of the symphysis. An incision is made through the cartilaginous portion of the symphysis to allow modest separation of the pubic bones, which is permanent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shoulder-dystocia-intrapartum-diagnosis-management-and-outcome/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

It occurs in 0.2 to 3 percent of births. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2159030231\" class=\"local\">'Incidence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The occurrence of shoulder dystocia cannot be accurately predicted on the basis of antenatal risk factors or labor abnormalities. Therefore, the clinician should be prepared for possible shoulder dystocia in all vaginal deliveries and be cognizant of the various procedures that have been shown to be effective for delivering the impacted shoulders. (See <a href=\"#H2745359204\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shoulder dystocia is an obstetric emergency. The goal of management is to prevent fetal asphyxia, permanent brachial plexus palsy, or death, while avoiding fetal or maternal physical injury. However, treatable traumatic injuries (eg, fetal clavicular or long bone fracture, maternal genital tract laceration) are acceptable if warranted to prevent permanent injury in the child. (See <a href=\"#H2745359204\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no randomized trials comparing results from use of the various maneuvers to manage shoulder dystocia. The general consensus is that no maneuver is clearly superior for resolving the dystocia and preventing neurologic injury, and that all maneuvers can increase the degree of stretch on the brachial plexus, resulting in brachial plexus injury. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Choice of approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our general approach to shoulder dystocia is described in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F107812\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107812 \">table 1</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Initial steps in management include having the patient stop pushing, ensuring proper patient position, assembling necessary personnel, and draining a distended bladder. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Initial steps'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest the McRoberts maneuver without and then with suprapubic pressure as the initial approach for releasing the impacted shoulder, given that it is less invasive than other maneuvers (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'McRoberts maneuver'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the McRoberts maneuver with suprapubic pressure is unsuccessful, we suggest delivery of the posterior arm (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H28001966\" class=\"local\">'Delivery of the posterior arm'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If it is not possible to reach the elbow or forearm, we attempt to deliver the posterior shoulder by pulling on the axilla to bring it down into the posterior pelvic space. This may release the anterior shoulder, or allow access to the elbow or forearm so that the posterior arm can be delivered, or allow a rotational maneuver to release the anterior shoulder. (See <a href=\"#H523783555\" class=\"local\">'Delivery of the posterior shoulder (Menticoglou maneuver)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the above maneuvers are unsuccessful, we perform a rotational maneuver (Woods, Rubin).

Some providers prefer to use it before attempting to deliver the posterior arm or shoulder as the latter require more technical proficiency. (See <a href=\"#H3617381137\" class=\"local\">'Gaskin all-fours maneuver'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clear and complete documentation in the medical record is critically important after deliveries complicated by shoulder dystocia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F54369%7EOBGYN%2F70280\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54369 graphicRef70280 \">figure 8A-B</a>).
