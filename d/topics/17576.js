In June 2009, the World Health Organization raised its pandemic alert level to the highest level, phase 6, indicating widespread community transmission on at least two continents. The pandemic was declared to be over in August 2010. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with confirmed or suspected influenza infection requiring treatment during the 2009 to 2010 H1N1 influenza A pandemic, a neuraminidase inhibitor (orally inhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zanamivir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zanamivir</a> or oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oseltamivir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oseltamivir</a>) was recommended.

In those who were unable to use inhaled zanamivir (eg, critically ill patients, patients with a history of bronchospasm), the intravenous formulation was considered appropriate. (See <a href=\"#H412464\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous zanamivir'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The United States Food and Drug Administration issued emergency use authorization for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peramivir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">peramivir</a>, an investigational neuraminidase inhibitor that is administered intravenously, for the treatment of certain hospitalized and critically ill patients with suspected or confirmed pandemic H1N1 influenza A infection. (See <a href=\"#H412471\" class=\"local\">'Peramivir'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antiviral therapy was recommended for individuals with suspected or confirmed pandemic H1N1 influenza A infection who were severely ill or who had risk factors for complications (eg, pregnancy, age &lt;5 or &gt;65 years, severe immunocompromise). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several observational studies of hospitalized patients with pandemic H1N1 influenza A suggested that treatment with a neuraminidase inhibitor (most commonly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oseltamivir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oseltamivir</a>) reduced disease severity and mortality. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The vast majority of strains of pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus circulating in 2009 to 2010 were sensitive in vitro to the neuraminidase inhibitors, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oseltamivir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oseltamivir</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zanamivir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zanamivir</a>, but all strains tested were resistant to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amantadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amantadine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rimantadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rimantadine</a>.

Starting with the 2010 influenza season in the southern hemisphere and the 2010 to 2011 season in the northern hemisphere, the trivalent influenza vaccine included antigen from the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus. (See <a href=\"#H413651\" class=\"local\">'Vaccination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although most formulations of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza vaccine were well tolerated, individuals in several countries in Europe have developed narcolepsy after receiving Pandemrix, an AS03 (oil-in-water emulsion)-adjuvanted 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine. The risk appears to be greatest in children and adolescents.
