Lynch syndrome is the most common inherited CRC susceptibility syndrome and accounts for approximately 3 percent of newly diagnosed cases of CRC and 3 percent of endometrial cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It is estimated that 1 in 279 of the population carry mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H345552210\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lynch syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder that is caused by a germline mutation in one of several DNA mismatch repair genes or loss of expression of <em>MSH2 </em>due to deletion in the <em>EPCAM</em> gene (previously called <em>TACSTD1</em>). The mismatch repair (MMR) genes that are associated with Lynch syndrome include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>MLH1</em> (MutL homolog 1), which is located on chromosome 3p22.2</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>MSH2</em> (MutS homolog 2), which is located on chromosome 2p21-16</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>MSH6</em> (MutS homolog 6), which is located on chromosome 2p16.3</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>PMS2 </em>(postmeiotic segregation 2), which are located on chromosome 7p22.1</p><p/><p>Among individuals with identifiable germline mutations in the MMR genes based on tumor phenotyping, mutations in <em>MLH1, MSH2, MSH6</em>,<em> </em>and<em> PMS2</em> are found in approximately 37, 41, 13, and 9 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>The role of the DNA MMR system is to maintain genomic integrity by correcting base substitution mismatches and small insertion-deletion mismatches that are generated by errors in base pairing during DNA replication. Normal MMR requires the coordinated function of several different gene products. The MMR system recognizes base-pair mismatches by two heterodimeric protein complexes termed MutS-alpha and MutS-beta. MutS-alpha is a heterodimer of MSH2 and MSH6 proteins and MutS-beta is an <span class=\"nowrap\">MSH2/MSH3</span> heterodimer. Either the <span class=\"nowrap\">MSH2/6</span> or the <span class=\"nowrap\">MSH2/3</span> pair can recognize <span class=\"nowrap\">insertion/deletion</span> loops that contain more than two bases but the <span class=\"nowrap\">MSH2/6</span> pair preferentially recognizes single base-base mispairs and small (one to two base) insertion-deletion loops [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The repair components of the MMR system consist of three other heterodimer pairs termed MutL-alpha, MutL-beta, and MutL-gamma. MutL-alpha is a heterodimer of MLH1 and PMS2, MutL-beta is a <span class=\"nowrap\">MLH1/PMS1</span> heterodimer, and MutL-gamma is a <span class=\"nowrap\">MLH1/MLH3</span> heterodimer.</p><p>Inactivation of both alleles of one of the MMR genes leads to defective MMR (ie, they are recessive at a cellular level although germline mutations are seen as dominant at the clinical level as two hits are necessary to disable the gene). As a general rule, patients with Lynch syndrome have a germline mutation in one allele of a MMR gene and the second allele is inactivated somatically by mutation, loss of heterozygosity, or epigenetic silencing by promoter hypermethylation. Biallelic inactivation of MMR genes in a cell then causes an increased mutation rate (genomic instability) due to failure to repair the DNA mismatches that occur during normal DNA synthesis (about one in every 10<sup>6</sup> bases). DNA mismatches commonly occur in regions of repetitive nucleotide sequences called microsatellites. Thus, a characteristic feature of loss of mismatch repair in tumors is the expansion or contraction of these microsatellite regions in the tumor compared with normal tissue. This genetic alteration is termed microsatellite instability (MSI) and is characteristic of Lynch-associated cancers. Microsatellite instability may affect genes that control cell growth (transforming growth factor [TGF] beta and insulin-like growth factor [sIGF] receptors), regulate apoptotic cell death (Caspase 5, Bax), and some of the DNA MMR genes themselves (<em>hMSH3, hMSH6</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Accumulation of mutations in these cancer-related genes is thought to drive the process of carcinogenesis in Lynch syndrome.</p><p>However, MSI is not specific for Lynch syndrome, and approximately 15 percent of sporadic colorectal cancers also demonstrate MSI. Sporadic MSI-high (MSI-H) colorectal cancers typically develop through a methylation pathway called CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), which is characterized by aberrant patterns of DNA methylation and frequently by mutations in the <em>BRAF</em> gene. These cancers develop somatic promoter methylation of <em>MLH1</em>,<em> </em>leading to loss of MLH1 function and resultant MSI. The prevalence of loss of<em> MLH1</em> expression in CRC increases markedly with aging and this trend is particularly evident in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

In <em>EPCAM</em> 3' end deletion carriers, <em>MSH2</em> inactivation is cell type-specific. <em>MSH2 </em>is only inactivated in cells in which the <em>EPCAM</em> locus is active, therefore showing a mosaic pattern of <em>MSH2</em> inactivation. This may lead to a tumor spectrum that is different from individuals with a germline <em>MSH2</em> mutation or a deletion that encompasses <em>EPCAM</em> as well as <em>MSH2</em> or extending close to the <em>MSH2</em> promoter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

The adenoma-carcinoma sequence also progresses much more rapidly in Lynch syndrome as compared with sporadic CRC (35 months versus 10 to 15 years).

The majority of FAP-associated brain tumors are medulloblastomas, whereas in Lynch syndrome gliomas are more common.

Traditionally, a family history of colorectal and other cancers was the primary tool to identify Lynch syndrome.

However, they are limited in their sensitivity. Although the performance characteristics of clinical prediction models (eg, MMRpro, MMRpredict, PREMM<sub>1,2,6</sub>) improve on clinical criteria in identifying patients with Lynch syndrome, the models still depend on clinicians to suspect the possibility of a hereditary syndrome and elicit an accurate family history, so universal use of tumor testing for mismatch repair deficiency has now been advocated.
