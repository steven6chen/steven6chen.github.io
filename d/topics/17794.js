They typically experience distress when thinking about discarding things and perceive a need to save them. Possessions thus congest and clutter their living areas, compromising use of these spaces, interfere with the individual&rsquo;s daily life, and cause clinically significant distress. </p><p/><p>Hoarding disorder was newly included in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hoarding-disorder-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], replacing the conceptualization of extreme hoarding in DSM-IV as a form of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hoarding-disorder-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. As a more recently specified mental disorder, there is less research available on hoarding disorder and its treatment compared with many disorders.</p><p>The treatment of hoarding disorder in adults is reviewed here. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis of hoarding disorder are reviewed separately. OCD in adults is also reviewed separately.

It can be challenging to engage with these patients so that they will accept treatment. Involving relatives or other significant persons can be helpful. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Education</strong> &ndash; Risks due to hoarding (eg, risks of fire or <span class=\"nowrap\">tripping/falling</span> as a result of excessive accumulation of possessions) should be assessed and, if appropriate, addressed at the beginning of treatment. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Protective services</strong> &ndash; Community services such as housing, public health, or social work professionals may be needed to help maintain the health and safety of the individuals who hoard. If vulnerable individuals are living in the home (eg, children or disabled persons) and deemed to be at risk, appropriate agencies should be involved as part of the overall care plan. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Comorbidity</strong> &ndash; Patients with hoarding disorder should be assessed for co-occurring mental disorders, in particular, mood or anxiety disorders, which are particularly common in individuals with hoarding disorder. These disorders, if present, should be treated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hoarding-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis#H4289292263\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hoarding disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Comorbidities'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2670972290\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest first line treatment of hoarding disorder with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) developed specifically to treat hoarding disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hoarding-disorder-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The availability of this intervention is geographically limited to a handful of specialist academic centers and by lack of therapists trained in the delivery of this treatment. Multiple clinical trials have found that the CBT intervention modestly reduces hoarding symptoms. There are no randomized clinical trials of medications to treat hoarding disorder; data from uncontrolled trials provide inconclusive evidence of efficacy. (See <a href=\"#H1170131693\" class=\"local\">'Cognitive-behavioral therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H917985193\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3382509695\"><span class=\"h2\">Response to first-line treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonresponse to a full course of CBT should prompt attempts to understand reasons for treatment failure. Possibilities and subsequent next steps include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of an unidentified, untreated co-occurring disorder &ndash; Patients should be re-evaluated. Comorbid conditions should be treated if present. A 2016 case report described a hoarding patient with a comorbid bipolar II disorder, whose hoarding behavior improved in response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamotrigine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamotrigine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylphenidate</a> treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hoarding-disorder-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Patients may find these experiences too aversive and therapists may be inexperienced. Exposure to discarding and not acquiring should be done gradually and intensify as the therapy progresses. Increasing the intensity of exposure, for example via home visits, may give patients the extra push they need to face their fears. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Failure to stop excessive acquisition &ndash; Patients who make progress discarding objects may nonetheless continue to acquire new objects excessively. Additional emphasis on measures to prevent such acquisition would be indicated. As an example, the therapist might accompany the patient on trips to high risk places, such as charity shops.</p><p/><p><a href=\"http://hoarding.iocdf.org/&amp;token=8D9t7RF3qfuCdDUXHLEfcW4U4lR2C+j/GFb3IeyyOxnD1CS446gaIW/BEtFed/pH&amp;TOPIC_ID=107912\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Mutual help groups</a> for individuals who hoard offer support and may contribute to symptom reduction for patients who do not respond to CBT.

Motivational interviewing methods, developed originally for the treatment of substance use disorders, are used to address ambivalence about therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=motivational-interviewing-for-substance-use-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Motivational interviewing for substance use disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Techniques include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Open-ended questions &ndash; &ldquo;Why do you think the clutter got out of hand?&rdquo; </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Reflective listening statements &ndash; These indicate listening and observing, and include repeating, rephrasing, and paraphrasing (&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t like that&rdquo;).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Complex reflections &ndash; These amplify what clients have said with educated guesses about their thoughts and feeling.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Education and goal setting.</strong> </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Skills training</strong> &ndash; Training in organizing, decision-making, and problem-solving.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Curbing excessive acquisition</strong> &ndash; Treatment focuses on stopping the flow of items coming in before moving on to difficulties with discarding and clutter. Thus, if a patient presents with excessive acquisition, this should be addressed first.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Exposure</strong> &ndash; To habituate to the anxiety provoked by the idea of discarding or not acquiring possessions, patients are encouraged to gradually expose themselves to the discomfort associated with not acquiring, sorting and discarding possessions. As an example, they might first be asked to focus on a particular area of the home, such as the coffee table piled with papers and objects. They are then asked to decide what to keep and what to throw away. For patients who acquire excessively, they may be encouraged to expose themselves to progressively stronger acquiring triggers (eg, visiting flea market or shops without buying anything to learn to tolerate urges to acquire).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cognitive strategies</strong> &ndash; Cognitive restructuring exercises are used to identify and subsequently modify errors in thinking. As example, challenging questions can be used when sorting, discarding, and practicing nonacquiring to help thinking critically: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&ldquo;How many do I already have?&rdquo;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&ldquo;Do I plan to use this?&rdquo;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&ldquo;Have I used this in the past year?&rdquo;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&ldquo;Do I really need it?&rdquo;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2495753367\"><span class=\"h3\">Administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The intervention is delivered over an extended period, eg, 7 to 12 months, at weekly office sessions and visits to the patient&rsquo;s home at two to four week intervals. The number of sessions generally ranges from 12 to 35. Treatment is typically delivered in an individual format, although group formats have been tested with acceptable results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hoarding-disorder-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2603061334\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple randomized trials have found CBT to modestly reduce symptoms in patients with hoarding disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hoarding-disorder-in-adults/abstract/5,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9-11</a>]. In contrast to older studies of hoarding, these trials studied patients with a primary hoarding disorder rather than hoarding as a feature of another condition such as obsessive-compulsive disorder:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A clinical trial randomly assigned 46 patients with hoarding disorder to CBT specific to hoarding disorder or to a waitlist condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hoarding-disorder-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. After 12 weeks, CBT participants showed more improvement on hoarding-symptom and mood-symptom severity compared with waitlist patients, with moderate effect sizes. Forty one patients ultimately initiated CBT due to a crossover design; after six months, 71 percent were rated as very much or much improved on the Clinical Global Improvement Scale. The trial was limited by a high treatment <span class=\"nowrap\">refusal/dropout</span> rate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A clinical trial randomly assigned 38 patients to CBT with home assistance, or CBT without home assistance, or bibliotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hoarding-disorder-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. CBT was delivered in group format over 20 weekly sessions. Participants in the bibliotherapy group were assigned a self-help book to read over the 20-week period describing specific skills to reduce hoarding. Participants in the two groups receiving CBT showed reductions on hoarding and depression symptoms compared with the bibliotherapy group. No difference was seen in the extent of hoarding symptom reduction among patients receiving CBT with and without home assistance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A clinical trial randomly assigned 38 patients with hoarding disorder to participate in a 13-week structured support-CBT group (the Buried in Treasures Workshop) or a waitlist control group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hoarding-disorder-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. At the end of the trial, only patients assigned to the support-CBT group met criteria for clinical response compared with the waitlisted group (30 versus 0 percent). Greater improvement was also seen in the support-CBT group compared with waitlist on overall hoarding symptoms and on hoarding beliefs. &#160;</p><p/><p>The long-term benefit of the CBT intervention for hoarding is not fully known. Data from a trial of 31 patients found that the treatment gains were largely maintained at 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hoarding-disorder-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H287168241\"><span class=\"h2\">Cognitive remediation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cognitive remediation is a behavioral intervention designed to improve cognitive function through repeated task practice. In contrast to CBT, which aims to change the cognitions and behaviors related to hoarding difficulties, cognitive remediation focuses on improving neuropsychological functioning and information-processing deficits that may be involved in the development of hoarding behaviors. Some of these functions include attention, categorization, or memory. </p><p>A small randomized clinical trial did not support the efficacy of cognitive remediation as sole therapy for hoarding disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hoarding-disorder-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The trial randomly assigned 17 patients with hoarding disorder to a standardized program of computer-assisted cognitive remediation or a relaxation control condition. Cognitive remediation produced improvements in attention relative to the relaxation control condition, but after eight weeks, no difference between groups was seen in hoarding severity, memory, or executive functioning. Further testing should also evaluate cognitive remediation as an adjunct to CBT. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H917985193\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOTHERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There has been little study of medications for hoarding. Observational trials and case series suggest a potential role for serotonergic antidepressants and possibly other medications but well-designed clinical trials are needed to evaluate their efficacy. Much of the existing research was conducted in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and hoarding rather than with DSM-5 hoarding disorder.

In high risk situations, forcible action may be needed, eg, to remove children or elderly individuals from the home to ensure their safety. (See <a href=\"#H1344360696\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with hoarding disorder should be assessed for co-occurring mental disorders, in particular, affective and anxiety disorders, which are common in individuals with hoarding disorder. These disorders, if present, should be treated. (See <a href=\"#H1344360696\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hoarding-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis#H4289292263\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hoarding disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Comorbidities'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest first line treatment of hoarding disorder with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) developed specifically to treat the disorder rather than medication or other psychosocial interventions (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The availability of this intervention is limited to a handful of specialist academic centers. (See <a href=\"#H2670972290\" class=\"local\">'Initial treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1170131693\" class=\"local\">'Cognitive-behavioral therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonresponse to a full course of CBT should prompt further evaluation for an unidentified co-occurring disorder, a need for more intensive exposure to discarding, or the presence of excessive acquisition that has not been adequately addressed. The addition of participation in a mutual help group may be useful. (See <a href=\"#H3382509695\" class=\"local\">'Response to first-line treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who remain resistant to psychosocial interventions, or who lack access to them, can be provided a trial of a serotonin-reuptake inhibiting medication, particularly in patients with comorbid mood or anxiety disorders; however, there are a lack of controlled clinical trials testing the efficacy of this approach in individuals with primary hoarding disorder.
