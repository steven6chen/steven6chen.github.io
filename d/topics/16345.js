(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiologic-associations-of-hepatocellular-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiologic associations of hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;</a>.) It is typically diagnosed late in the course of these diseases, and the median survival following diagnosis ranges from approximately 6 to 20 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Available therapeutic options for HCC are dictated by the complex interplay of tumor stage and the extent of underlying liver disease.</p><p>This topic review will provide an overview of staging and prognostic scoring systems for HCC. Surgical and nonsurgical treatments for HCC are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-treatment-approaches-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of treatment approaches for hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">STAGING AND PROGNOSTIC SCORING SYSTEMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of systems have been proposed to predict the prognosis for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), none of which has been universally adopted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/2-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-8</a>]. These schema variably incorporate four features that have been recognized as being important determinants of survival: the severity of underlying liver disease, the size of the tumor, extension of the tumor into adjacent structures, and the presence of metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/2,3,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,9-11</a>]; some (eg, the Hong Kong and French prognostic staging systems) also incorporate performance status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8</a>]. The four most commonly used systems are the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM), Okuda and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) systems, and the Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) score. A new, evidence-based score &ndash; the ALBI (albumin-bilirubin) grade &ndash; if independently validated, may allow more objective assessment of the severity of liver dysfunction in patients with HCC across a wide spectrum of treatments. (See <a href=\"#H264051047\" class=\"local\">'ALBI score'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The current version of the combined American Joint Committee on Cancer <span class=\"nowrap\">(AJCC)/Union</span> for International Cancer Control (UICC) TNM staging system from 2017 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110835\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110835 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] contains some significant changes in the primary tumor (T) classification relative to the 2010 version [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T1 has been subdivided into two subcategories: T1a (solitary tumors &le;2 cm) and T1b (solitary tumors without vascular invasion &gt;2 cm).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T2 now includes a solitary tumor with vascular invasion &gt;2 cm, or multiple tumors, none &gt;5 cm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The previous T3a category (patients with multiple tumors, any of which are &gt;5 cm) is now recategorized as T3, while tumors that were previously considered T3b (single or multiple tumors of any size that involve a major portal vein or hepatic vein) are now T4, as are tumors with direct invasion of adjacent organs other than the gallbladder or with perforation of the visceral peritoneum.</p><p/><p>The discriminatory prognostic potential of subdividing primary tumors according to size and microvascular invasion in the new 2017 TNM classification has been validated in patients undergoing resection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110834\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110834 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Although neither the presence of cirrhosis nor histologic grade is used to assign the final tumor stage, the fibrosis score of the underlying liver is included as a clinically significant prognostic factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-19</a>], as is alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level, the presence or absence of cirrhosis, and the Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The TNM staging system is the only one that is validated in patients treated with either hepatic resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>] or transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] for HCC. &#160;</p><p>However, for patients with severe underlying liver disease, it is underlying liver function that dominates prognosis. The importance of underlying cirrhosis was demonstrated in a study from Hong Kong, which described survival according to TNM stage and tumor size in patients with and without cirrhosis related to hepatitis B (HBV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Five-year survival was similar in those with and without cirrhosis who had solitary tumors &le;5 cm (61 versus 62 percent). On the other hand, five-year survival was worse in patients with cirrhosis with tumors &gt;5 cm (28 versus 40 percent). In such patients, the Okuda and CLIP systems are more useful than the TNM stage to stratify prognosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Okuda system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to the TNM classification, the prognostic scoring system proposed by Okuda includes tumor size and three measures of the severity of cirrhosis (the amount of ascites and the serum albumin and bilirubin levels) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F56735\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56735 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In one study, survival was 8.3, 2.0, and 0.7 months for untreated patients with Okuda stages, I, II, and III, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The Okuda system does not stratify patients by vascular invasion or the presence or absence of nodal metastases. Because most patients staged according to this system are not candidates for resection, it is a purely clinical scoring system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">CLIP score</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The CLIP score is the most recently developed prognostic scoring system for HCC. It combines tumor-related features (macroscopic tumor morphology, serum AFP levels, and the presence or absence of portal vein thrombosis) with an index of the severity of cirrhosis to determine a prognostic score ranging from 0 to 6 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F69726\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69726 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>Several studies from varied geographic regions have suggested that CLIP performed better at predicting survival compared with the earlier versions of the TNM, Okuda, or Child-Pugh systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/3,4,22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,22-24</a>], particularly among patients undergoing nonsurgical therapy (eg, transarterial chemoembolization [TACE]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsurgical-therapies-for-localized-hepatocellular-carcinoma-transarterial-embolization-radiotherapy-and-radioembolization#H1248650321\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonsurgical therapies for localized hepatocellular carcinoma: Transarterial embolization, radiotherapy, and radioembolization&quot;, section on 'Primary treatment of unresectable or multifocal HCC'</a>.)</p><p>In a validation study, the median survival rates for patients with CLIP stages 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 to 6 were 31, 27, 13, 8, 2, and 2 months, respectively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F75441\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75441 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A modified version of the score (incorporating the MELD score) has also been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Some groups are investigating whether prognostication with the CLIP score can be improved by the addition of serum factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-1). (See <a href=\"#H352096713\" class=\"local\">'New prognostic markers under investigation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">The Barcelona staging classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The BCLC staging classification comprises four stages that are based upon the extent of the primary lesion, performance status, the presence of constitutional symptoms, vascular invasion and extrahepatic spread, and Okuda stage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This system has been criticized because of its algorithmic, rather than patient-centered approach, and growing movements in the West and in Asia disagree with some principles of the algorithm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. &#160; Although in at least two comparative studies it outperformed other prognostic models (including the AJCC TNM staging system) in patients undergoing surgical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>], several larger series show that other prognostic scoring systems outperform Barcelona [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/20,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,31</a>], and still others show that treatment outside of Barcelona guidelines (particularly resection) impacts outcomes and that its utility is limited in patients undergoing surgical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p>Early stage (A) patients are asymptomatic and have tumors that are suitable for radical therapies; intermediate stage (B) patients are asymptomatic and have multinodular HCC; advanced stage (C) patients have symptomatic tumors, vascular invasion, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> extrahepatic spread but have preserved liver function according to the Child-Pugh Turcotte classification (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78401 \">table 4</a>). Patients with stage D disease have either Okuda stage III tumors, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 3 or 4 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72901 \">table 5</a>), or clearly decompensated cirrhosis. Stage B and C patients are not good candidates for resection, but may be candidates for palliative systemic therapy or new agents in the setting of phase II investigations or randomized controlled trials. Patients with stage D tumors have an extremely poor prognosis, and treatment should be geared toward symptom control.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H264051047\"><span class=\"h2\">ALBI score</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The importance of underlying liver function for the prognosis of HCC, the limitations and lack of validation for scoring systems such as the Child-Turcotte-Pugh (Child-Pugh) classification in the setting of HCC, and the lack of a universally accepted prognostic system led an international group to develop a simple, objective tool for assessing liver function in patients with HCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The model was developed from data on 1313 Japanese patients with different stages of HCC; in multivariate analysis, bilirubin and albumin emerged as the only non-tumor related variables that influenced survival in multivariate analysis. These two factors were combined into a model (the ALBI model) to compare against the Child-Pugh score. The linear predictor was calculated to = (log<sub>10</sub> bilirubin x 0.66) + (albumin x -.085) with bilirubin in <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L</span> and albumin in <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L</span>. Cutpoint analysis revealed three separate prognostic groups: ALBI grade I (score &le;-2.60), grade II (score &gt;-2.60 to &le;-1.39), and grade III (&gt;-1.39).</p><p>After application to training and validation sets of the initial Japanese cohorts, ALBI was further validated in more than 5000 patients from around the world (cohorts similar to the Japanese patients) and in other different treatment cohorts (525 patients treated with resection, 1132 treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorafenib</a> for advanced disease, and 501 patients with chronic liver disease alone). The model proved to be discriminatory in all studied groups. Furthermore, survival in ALBI categories differed across all regions although the model was discriminatory in every region and group tested &#160;The majority (96 percent) of patients had Child-Pugh A cirrhosis at presentation, and within this grade, two distinct prognostic groups emerged across all regions.</p><p>The ALBI grade provides a simple, evidence-based, objective, and discriminatory method of assessing liver function in patients with HCC that may diminish interobserver variation (as occurs with grading of ascites and encephalopathy in the Child-Pugh scoring system). If independently validated, use of the ALBI score may allow better refinement of prognostic estimates in patients with HCC across a wide spectrum of treatments, particularly among those with better liver function. A calculator for the ALBI score is available (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-albumin-bilirubin-albi-grade-estimate-of-survival-of-adults-with-hepatocellular-carcinoma\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2553020163\"><span class=\"h2\">RETREAT and MoRAL scores</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several factors are associated with tumor recurrence after liver transplantation for HCC, but no reliable prognostic score has been established to determine individual recurrence risk. Investigators at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) developed a scoring system (Risk Estimation of Tumor Recurrence After Transplant [RETREAT]) using data from 721 patients who met Milan criteria (single lesion &le;5 cm; up to three separate lesions, none larger than 3 cm; no evidence of gross vascular invasion; and no regional nodal or distant metastases) and were transplanted for HCC between 2002 and 2012 at three academic transplant centers; the model was validated in a separate cohort of 341 patients also meeting Milan criteria who were transplanted at a fourth academic center over the same time period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-for-hepatocellular-carcinoma#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Indications for transplantation'</a>.) </p><p>Three variables were independently associated with disease recurrence (microvascular invasion, serum AFP level at the time of transplantation, and the sum of the largest viable tumor diameter for all viable tumors on explant), and they were used to construct a scoring system to predict one-year and five-year recurrence risk (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110845\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110845 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p>Another tool (the Model of Recurrence after Liver Transplantation [MoRAL] score, based upon serum levels of protein induced by vitamin K absence-II [PIVKA-II, des-gamma carboxyprothrombin] and AFP) has been developed to predict tumor recurrence after living-donor liver transplantation for HCC both within and beyond the Milan criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The MoRAL score was defined as 11 times the square root of PIVKA-II (in milli-Anson units <span class=\"nowrap\">[mAU]/mL)</span> plus two times the square root of the serum AFP (in <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span>. Most laboratories in the United States measure des-gamma carboxyprothrombin in <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL;</span> the conversion is 1 ng = 52.6 mAU of purified des-gamma carboxyprothrombin. In both groups, a low MoRAL score (&le;314.8) was associated with significantly longer recurrence-free and overall survivals. The MoRAL score appeared to outperform the RETREAT score in both cohorts.</p><p>Although promising, these models require independent validation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of staging system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no consensus as to which staging system is best in predicting the survival of patients with HCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/29,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,36,37</a>]. In general, pathologic staging systems such as the TNM staging system predict prognosis better than do clinical systems, particularly when assessing the outcomes of resection. As noted above, only the AJCC staging system has been validated in independent cohorts of patients undergoing either hepatic resection or transplantation. Okuda, Barcelona, and CLIP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] are more useful for predicting outcomes in patients with poor liver function who have advanced HCC and are undergoing nonsurgical therapy.</p><p>The consensus of the Americas Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association (updated in 2010) reasserts the need to use different systems in different patients. Their consensus statement recommends the use of the TNM system to predict outcome following resection or liver transplantation and the BCLC scheme for patients with advanced HCC who are not candidates for surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER FACTORS INFLUENCING SURVIVAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the severity of liver disease and the tumor characteristics discussed above, several other features related to survival have emerged from a large number of heterogeneous studies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-potentially-resectable-hepatocellular-carcinoma-prognosis-role-of-neoadjuvant-and-adjuvant-therapy-and-posttreatment-surveillance#H969401849\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of potentially resectable hepatocellular carcinoma: Prognosis, role of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy, and posttreatment surveillance&quot;, section on 'Long-term outcomes'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">High versus low-incidence regions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overall survival appears to be shorter in high-incidence regions compared with low-incidence regions. The median survival of untreated patients from the time of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) diagnosis ranged from less than one to three months in high-incidence areas of Africa and Asia, to between two and four months in relatively low-incidence Western countries in a number of reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/11,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,39,40</a>]. This difference may in part be explained by variability in the frequency of extrahepatic metastasis at the time of diagnosis. Metastases were present in greater than 50 percent of African and Asian patients, while in Western patients, only one-third of those without cirrhosis and one-half of those with cirrhosis had metastasis at diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Tumor histology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Well-differentiated clear cell tumors and the presence of tumor encapsulation have been associated with a better prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Some suggest the utility of using tumor grade to select patients for treatment (eg, liver transplantation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>], although this has not yet been accepted into practice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Serum alpha-fetoprotein level</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level at presentation correlates with tumor size and extent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The relationship between tumor growth and the rise in serum AFP was evaluated in a report that included 22 Japanese patients with cirrhosis and HCCs that were less than 3 cm who were followed for up to 37 months without treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Serum AFP levels tended to increase when the mass attained a diameter of greater than 3 cm; in particular, a sudden acceleration in the rate of increase in AFP level often coincided with a significant change in the ultrasonographic appearance of the tumor. The serum AFP levels progressively rose to between 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> and 10,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> as the tumors increased in size past 5 cm in diameter.</p><p>The serum AFP level also appeared to be an independent predictor of survival in some reports even after adjusting for its interaction with tumor size and histology. In one report, for example, survival in patients with a serum AFP of greater than 10,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> at diagnosis was significantly shorter compared with those with a serum AFP &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (7.6 versus 33.9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. High AFP levels were associated with poorly-differentiated tumors.</p><p>Whether preoperative AFP levels represent an independent prognostic factor in patients undergoing resection for HCC is unclear; the data are mixed.

Tumors containing this variant tend to be more aggressive with shorter doubling times. The presence of variant estrogen receptors was a better predictor of an unfavorable prognosis compared with the Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) and Barcelona classifications in a study involving 96 patients (of whom 44 had the variant receptor) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Some reports show an adverse effect of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive status as compared with HBeAg-negative status in terms of HCC recurrence and survival after hepatectomy, perhaps as a result of more active viral replication and a greater predisposition to multiple carcinogenesis in those who are HBeAg-positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>].

These schema variably incorporate four features that have been recognized as being important determinants of survival:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The severity of underlying liver disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tumor size</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Extension of the tumor into adjacent structures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Presence or absence of metastases</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The four most commonly used systems are the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system of the combined American Joint Committee on Cancer <span class=\"nowrap\">(AJCC)/Union</span> for International Cancer Control (UICC) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110835\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110835 \">table 1</a>), the Okuda and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) system, and the Cancer of the Liver Italian Program (CLIP) score. A new, evidence-based score, the ALBI (albumin-bilirubin) grade, if independently validated, may allow more objective assessment of the severity of liver dysfunction in patients with HCC across a wide spectrum of treatments. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Staging and prognostic scoring systems'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no single staging system that is best in predicting the survival of patients with HCC. Ultimately, staging of HCC is complex and relies on multiple factors including tumor extent and hepatic function, and no single staging system is applicable to all patients. The consensus of the Americas Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association (updated in 2010) reasserts the need to use different systems in different patients. Their consensus statement recommends the use of the TNM system to predict outcome following resection or liver transplantation and the BCLC scheme for patients with advanced HCC who are not candidates for surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-factors-in-hepatocellular-carcinoma/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Choice of staging system'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to the severity of underlying liver disease and the extent of disease spread, other factors influencing survival include whether patients are living in high-incidence versus low-incidence areas, the histologic grade of differentiation, and levels of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level at diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Other factors influencing survival'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carefully selected patients can undergo aggressive treatment (such as liver resection) with excellent outcomes, even if they have poor prognostic factors.
