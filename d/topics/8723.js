Prevention of liver disease has also improved. As an example, hepatitis A and B vaccines have reduced the incidence of acute viral hepatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-patients-with-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Furthermore, hepatitis B vaccines have resulted in a decline in the sequelae of chronic hepatitis B virus infection, and, despite the absence of a specific hepatitis D vaccine, a marked decrease in hepatitis D infections in the United States. Although not yet FDA approved, a hepatitis E vaccine may become available in the future [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-patients-with-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Despite these advances, chronic liver disease from multiple etiologies continues to be a prevalent health problem in the United States.</p><p>In one sense, patients with chronic liver disease are no different from the general population. Both groups require appropriate immunizations in order to maintain their general health status. However, for some individuals with chronic liver disease due to the bloodborne pathogens, shared risk factors may result in dual infections with hepatitis B and C or exposure to hepatitis A. Data suggest that the prevalence of hepatitis A infection is higher in patients with chronic liver disease than in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-patients-with-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Furthermore, in patients with chronic liver disease or in recipients of liver transplants, the superimposition of another acute disease (hepatitis virus superinfection, influenza, and pneumococcal infection) may result in higher morbidity and mortality than in individuals without pre-existing liver disease.</p><p>The impact of hepatitis viruses, pneumococcal disease, and influenza infection in the patient with chronic liver disease will be discussed here. Efficacy of preventive vaccines will also be discussed. For further information regarding general safety and efficacy issues related to these vaccines, please see appropriate topics.

Fatty liver and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, hereditary hemochromatosis, primary biliary cholangitis, autoimmune hepatitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, Wilson's disease, and granulomatous liver disease have received little attention. In one study of 225 patients with autoimmune liver diseases, all achieved seroconversion followed hepatitis A vaccination while 76 percent developed seroprotective levels of surface antibodies (anti-HBs) following hepatitis B vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-patients-with-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Both immunosuppressive therapy and advanced liver disease were common in nonresponders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-patients-with-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Other systemic disorders that may involve the liver (eg, celiac disease and cystic fibrosis) also have not been extensively studied. Nonetheless, HAV and HBV vaccinations have been recommended by one European group for individuals with cystic fibrosis, either at the time of diagnosis of cystic fibrosis or when liver involvement is recognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-patients-with-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Acute viral hepatitis, regardless of etiology, may have deleterious consequences when occurring as a superinfection in patients with pre-existing chronic viral hepatitis or the HBV carrier state. This phenomenon was demonstrated decades ago when acute hepatitis D (HDV or delta) superinfection of patients with chronic hepatitis B was shown to result in severe and progressive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-patients-with-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In a subsequent study of acute hepatitis in Taiwan, acute liver failure was observed in only 3.2 percent of 157 patients with acute viral hepatitis of varying etiologies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-patients-with-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In contrast, acute liver failure was seen in 20.3 percent of 177 acute hepatitis patients among HBsAg carriers. This increased risk was independent of the etiology of the acute hepatitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute hepatitis A</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anecdotal evidence that acute HAV superinfection could be a clinically important entity received modest attention until the publication of a longitudinal study in 1998 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-patients-with-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Both the course and outcome of acute hepatitis A superinfection in 17 (3.9 percent) of 432 patients with pre-existing chronic HCV who were monitored for 86 months were described. In 10 of the 17 patients the course of acute HAV infection was uncomplicated and all recovered. In contrast, seven patients developed acute hepatic failure after superinfection with HAV, and six of these died. Severe hepatocyte necrosis with lymphocytic and plasma cell infiltration of the liver was evident in all patients. Outcome was probably unrelated to chronic hepatitis C disease severity, since none of the fatal cases had cirrhosis. Since HCV replication was reduced during infection with HAV, suggesting viral interference, it seemed unlikely that HCV per se was directly responsible for the severity of HAV superinfection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-a-virus-infection-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis A virus infection in adults: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although the study was initially controversial due to the high fatality rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-patients-with-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>], subsequent studies have confirmed these observations in diverse regions. For example, in Thailand, 100 patients with acute hepatitis A without underlying chronic liver disease recovered fully, whereas 11 of 20 of patients with acute hepatitis A superimposed on the HBsAg carrier state and four of twelve patients with chronic hepatitis B or C developed fulminant or submassive liver necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-patients-with-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The average age of the patients who died was significantly older than those who survived their severe hepatitis (59 versus 40 years of age). These observations confirm the notion that HBsAg carriers, in whom liver disease is often mild, also are an increased risk of severe disease when superinfected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute hepatitis B</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anecdotal reports of acute hepatitis B superinfection of patients with chronic hepatitis C resulting in acute liver failure have supported the notion that superinfection may be devastating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-patients-with-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In a study of 21 patients with chronic HCV infection who developed acute hepatitis B, 28.6 percent had severe disease (encephalopathy, ascites, or hypoprothrombinemia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-patients-with-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In contrast, among 20 patients with acute hepatitis B in the absence of HCV infection, none had evidence of severe disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and natural history of hepatitis B virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute hepatitis C</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute hepatitis C superimposed on chronic hepatitis B also appears to be a clinically severe infection. Furthermore, those patients who develop chronic hepatitis C may have a worse long-term prognosis due to an increased risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-patients-with-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and natural history of chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Pneumococcal disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to individuals over 65 years of age, pneumococcal infections may be more prevalent and may elicit more severe disease and life-threatening complications in those with underlying medical conditions, regardless of age. In patients with chronic liver disease, and particularly in liver disease as a consequence of alcohol abuse, the incidence of pneumococcal disease is increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-patients-with-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. Patients with alcoholism also are likely to have an increased risk of dying from pneumococcal disease, including pneumonia, meningitis, and septicemia.</p><p>Some of these observations may be related to defective antibody formation, poor functioning of polymorphonuclear cells, malnutrition, and general debilitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-patients-with-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].

However, post-vaccination titers of anti-HAV were lower in the patients with liver disease than in controls. A similar reduction in anti-HAV titers was seen in 65 HBV-infected patients from Hong Kong when compared to 28 healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-patients-with-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

In one small study, utilizing recombinant HepB vaccine given at 0, 1, and 2 months, seroconversion rates measured three months after the first dose were 94 percent in 16 patients with fatty liver versus 39 percent in 13 patients with cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-patients-with-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>In a prospective study of 85 patients with chronic hepatitis C and 46 healthy adults, non-response to the three-dose regimen of the recombinant HepB vaccine was reported in 45 percent of patients and 2 percent in the control group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-patients-with-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

As a consequence, immunization appears to be underutilized in patients with chronic liver disease.</p><p>The US Department of Veterans Affairs has recommended the HepA vaccine for susceptible patients with chronic liver disease. A retrospective study was undertaken between 2000 and 2002 in two VA medical centers in New York to assess the frequency of testing for susceptibility to HAV and administration of the HepA vaccine to patients with chronic hepatitis C with the following results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-patients-with-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Despite multiple visits to their primary care practitioners or to the Gastroenterology Clinic, only 54 percent of the 1193 chronic hepatitis C patients identified had been tested for anti-HAV.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older patients and those with psychiatric disorders were less likely to be tested, while those with a history of an STD or those seen in the Gastroenterology Clinic were more likely to be tested.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Slightly more than half the tested patients were immune and did not require HAV vaccination. Among the susceptible, only 27 percent received at least one dose of the HepA vaccine.</p><p/><p>The clinical importance of this study in these two centers takes on added significance with the observation that on follow-up 3 of the 1193 chronic hepatitis C patients in this study developed acute hepatitis A and one of these died of acute liver failure. All three patients were susceptible to HAV and none had received the HepA vaccine.</p><p>In a separate retrospective cohort study of chronic hepatitis C patients receiving care at a large Veterans Administration Medical Center between 2002 and 2005, only 8 percent had documented receipt of hepatitis vaccines. Of those patients who had not been vaccinated, half had not been tested for susceptibility nor had negative serologies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-patients-with-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>Variations in coverage rates between primary care and specialist centers, such as gastroenterology and hepatology practices, involved in the care of patients with chronic liver disease are receiving attention. In a retrospective analysis of vaccine coverage in almost 700 patients with chronic liver disease seen by 22 primary care offices (337 patients) and 15 gastroenterologists or hepatologists (356 patients), chronic hepatitis C was the most common diagnosis, followed by non-alcoholic liver disease, alcoholic liver disease, and chronic hepatitis B [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunizations-for-patients-with-chronic-liver-disease/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. The study was notable for the following results:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients seen in primary care offices were more likely to receive seasonal influenza and pneumococcal vaccine than the patients who frequented specialty offices.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Of patients who were susceptible to HAV and HBV, patients were much more likely to receive hepatitis A or B vaccines if they were seen in specialist offices.</p><p/><p>Better communication between primary care personnel and specialists, with explicit understanding of which office will assume responsibility for immunization and accurate record keeping of immunization history may reduce vaccine underutilization in patients with chronic liver disease and improve health outcomes.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Impact of vaccine-preventable infections'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest vaccination of all patients with chronic liver disease against hepatitis A and B unless they are already immune (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). However, there remains uncertainty about how chronic liver disease should be defined. It is possible, for example, that patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease alone may not be at the same risk for serious morbidity from acute viral hepatitis as those with underlying hepatitis C. Until further data are available to better define the risks with specific forms of liver disease and the cost-effectiveness of vaccination strategies, we suggest immunization for patients with all forms of liver disease regardless of its severity. The benefits of vaccination are expected to be greatest in those with relatively advanced disease or those at risk for progressive liver disease. This recommendation also considers the safety of the available vaccinations. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Vaccines in chronic liver disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest pneumococcal vaccination in all adult patients with chronic liver disease, regardless of age (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).
