The goal of gene therapy trials has been to correct the inherited immune deficiency by introducing a functional copy of the patient's defective gene into the appropriate cells. This has been accomplished by removing HSCs from an affected patient, adding ex vivo a correct gene copy that integrates into chromosomal DNA, and then returning the cells to the patient as an autologous HCT. However, potential alternatives or adjunctive approaches to gene addition therapy or HCT are under development, including mutation-targeted drug treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] and autologous cell gene correction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Pharmacogenetic agents may temporarily or permanently correct genetic mutations at the nuclear level.</p><p>Allogeneic HCT and medical therapy of immunodeficiencies are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-primary-immunodeficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematopoietic cell transplantation for primary immunodeficiency&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-immunodeficiency-overview-of-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary immunodeficiency: Overview of management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENE THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gene therapy has the potential to cure genetically based diseases. In gene addition therapy, the gene copy must be introduced into a sufficient number of cells and also be adequately expressed for its product to correct the deficiency. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), the blood-forming cells that reside in bone marrow and differentiate into all blood elements, can be targeted for correction for defects in genes whose expression is primarily or exclusively important in developing hematopoietic lineages. Integration of a vector carrying the correct gene copy into the chromosomal DNA is needed to assure that the HSC correction is conferred on future generations of stem cells and their differentiated progeny to effect a permanent cure.</p><p>Genetically engineered viruses are the vectors used to carry the DNA of interest into host cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/4,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7,8</a>]. Viral genes required for virus propagation are deleted and replaced with a working copy of the human gene of interest. Viral DNA signals cause the DNA to be inserted into the host genome when retroviral or lentiviral vectors are used. Although initial success was more likely with expression of genes that confer a development or survival advantage over untransduced cells, protocols no longer rely on this in vivo selective advantage.</p><p>Gene therapy has been complicated by technical difficulties and risks of side effects from genomic manipulation. These barriers to wide application have been intensely researched, leading to safer, more effective therapies that promise to become standard therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/4,6,9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,9-12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">X-linked SCID</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the cytokine receptor subunit gamma-c (the &quot;common&quot; gamma chain) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F57323\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57323 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This receptor subunit is shared by at least six different cytokine receptor complexes: the receptors for interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15, and IL-21 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Gene therapy is successful in reconstituting immune function in infants with X-linked SCID but initially appeared to be less effective in older children and young adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/7,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,15</a>], a circumstance that has been overcome with subsequent improvements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. All trials to date have enrolled only patients who lacked a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical family donor for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), the gold-standard treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=x-linked-severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patient bone marrow or peripheral mobilized HSCs are harvested and enriched for HSCs using anti-CD34 antibodies. CD34+ stem cells are then cultured and stimulated with cytokines. The activated CD34+ stem cells are transduced in vitro with a retroviral or lentiviral vector carrying a gamma-c gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/4,9,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9,12</a>]. The retroviral RNA is reverse transcribed to DNA and integrated into the host genome. Transduced cells are then infused into the patient. Initial trials were conducted without any prior conditioning regimen, but subsequent approaches have relied upon low-dose, reduced-intensity conditioning with an alkylating agent such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a> to create open bone marrow niches. New immune cells expressing the transgene are usually first detected at around four to six weeks, but it generally takes three to six months for functional immune reconstitution.</p><p>Approximately 30 infants with X-linked SCID were treated with gene therapy in the initial trials with retrovirus vectors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/7,8,16-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,16-22</a>]. Ninety percent exhibited engraftment of fully functional mature T cells, and most had sustained reconstitution. Many also had sufficient humoral responses to eliminate the need for gamma globulin replacement for some time, even though the fraction of transduced B cells was small and became undetectable 6 to 10 years after therapy. Normal transduced natural killer cells were also seen, albeit in low numbers. Previously established infections were cleared, and no new serious infections occurred in any of the patients who achieved reconstitution of T cell function.</p><p>Retroviral gene therapy was not successful in reconstituting immune function in four out of five older patients (age 10 to 20 years), several of whom had failed allogeneic HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/15,16,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16,20</a>]. However, increased growth rates and subjective improvements in wellbeing were reported in two of the five patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Serious adverse events may occur with successful gene therapy. Five children with X-linked SCID who received therapy with a first-generation retroviral gamma-c vector in which the expression of IL-2 receptor subunit gamma (IL2RG) was driven by an intact retrovirus long terminal repeat (LTR) promotor developed a T cell acute leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/4,7,9,21,23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7,9,21,23-26</a>]. Four of the five children with iatrogenic leukemia were successfully treated with chemotherapy, while one died of his disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/7,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,23</a>]. In the patients who recovered, polyclonal populations of transduced T cells were restored after chemotherapy for their leukemia.</p><p>This type of retroviral vector preferentially integrates into gene-rich regions, especially near transcription start sites, and sometimes into common fragile sites (eg, LIM domain only 2 [LMO2]). This preferential integration, combined with activation of adjacent gene expression by the vector LTR sequence, contributed to the high rate of leukemia seen in these trials. In several patients, the provirus was shown to have integrated within the LMO2 oncogene locus, resulting in aberrant transcript LMO2 expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. Activation of LMO2 is associated with the development of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In mouse models, the therapeutic gene itself was also subsequently shown to have oncogenic potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics-in-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cytogenetics and molecular genetics in acute lymphoblastic leukemia&quot;, section on 'T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia'</a>.)</p><p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) first placed a clinical hold on &quot;all active gene therapy trials using retroviral vectors to insert genes into blood stem cells&quot; because of these cases of leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Subsequently, such therapy was allowed to continue on a case-by-case basis if no other treatment was available.</p><p>Self-inactivating retrovirus vectors, in which the LTRs containing viral enhancer sequences have been disabled, and lentiviruses using promotors other than the LTRs to drive expression of IL2RG are in use in clinical trials for the treatment of X-linked SCID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/4,9,12,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9,12,22</a>]. In the first series of nine infants treated with a self-inactivating retrovirus vector, seven had reconstitution of functional T cells and resolution of infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. One patient died from a pre-existing disseminated adenoviral infection before full T cell reconstitution occurred. Another patient had no evidence of vector DNA after the infusion of transduced cells and subsequently underwent successful umbilical cord blood transplantation. No serious adverse events related to the vector were reported in the median 29.1 months of follow-up (range 12.1 to 38.7 months). There was less clustering of insertion sites within lymphoid proto-oncogenes compared with that seen with previously retroviral vectors. No cases of leukemia have been reported. Longer-term follow-up is necessary to confirm lack of leukemogenesis with this modified vector. Older X-linked SCID patients receiving a lentivirus vector have demonstrated immune reconstitution of not only T cells, but also B cells, enabling them to discontinue <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> replacement therapy replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Adenosine deaminase deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Correction of adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency was the first application of gene therapy in immunodeficiency. Gene therapy for ADA deficiency appears to be most effective when patients are treated with myelosuppressive chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In initial studies, patients were also withdrawn from polyethylene glycol-adenosine deaminase (PEG-ADA) therapy prior to receiving gene therapy to take advantage of any selective survival that might be conferred by the gene addition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Case series of patients with ADA deficiency who have received gene therapy show excellent outcomes at four-year follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>In subsequent studies, patients were continued on their PEG-ADA enzyme replacement throughout the period when gene therapy was given, demonstrating that the chemotherapy, and not intrinsic survival advantage, is more important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In 2016, the success of gene addition therapy for ADA deficiency was approved in Europe as standard treatment for this disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/4,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10</a>], and approval in the US is in process.

A detailed discussion of the use of gene therapy in this disorder is also reviewed separately.

Gene therapy is under investigation for leukocyte-adhesion deficiency (LAD); SCID with deficiencies in Janus kinase 3 (JAK3), recombination-activating gene 2 (RAG2), or Artemis; and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Limitations of gene therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several important obstacles to overcome before gene therapy finds more widespread clinical utility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>One concern is the association of lymphoproliferative disease with gene therapy. Several approaches to reduce the risk of insertional oncogenesis are under development:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inactivation of gamma-retroviral LTRs that have intrinsic promoter-enhancing activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/7,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,22</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'X-linked SCID'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of alternative viral vectors, such as lentiviruses or foamy viruses, that are less likely to integrate near regulatory elements of genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/7,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,33,34</a>]. However, lentiviruses have a tendency to insert into transcribed genes, leading to the production of aberrantly spliced transcripts and deregulated (increased or decreased) gene expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. The vector sequence can be recoded to remove these cryptic splice signals, which may improve the safety of lentiviral vectors.</p><p/><p>Several other important technical obstacles include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isolation of the appropriate cell population for transduction. Transduction of pluripotent HSCs is ideal for disorders involving genes expressed in multiple leukocyte lineages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. It is only now becoming possible to isolate significant quantities of these cells from humans.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The efficiency with which genes are transduced into target cells. Generally, 0.1 percent or fewer blood leukocytes carry retroviral vector markers over the long term in clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This is particularly an issue if transduced cells do not have a significant survival advantage <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> differentiation advantage in comparison with untransduced cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Correction of defects in which proper regulation of gene expression is required necessitates vectors containing appropriate control sequences or site-specific gene integration.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">MUTATION-TARGETED THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The limitations of gene therapy, which are related to the requirements of gene addition, have spurred research into approaches that involve gene repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Most primary immunodeficiencies are caused by a multiple of different types of mutations (eg, nonsense, splice site, frameshift, and <span class=\"nowrap\">missense/in-frame)</span> that vary in frequency depending on the disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>A variety of drugs have been evaluated for their potential in mutation-targeted therapy. Classes of drugs include translational read-through compounds, antisense oligonucleotides, engineered zinc-finger nuclease fusion proteins, chimeric <span class=\"nowrap\">RNA/DNA</span> oligonucleotides (chimeraplasts), and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats <span class=\"nowrap\">(CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated</span> protein-9 nuclease (Cas9) gene correction. Some of these drugs, such as engineered zinc-finger nuclease fusion proteins, homing endonucleases, and <span class=\"nowrap\">CRISPR/Cas9,</span> mediate true gene correction, whereas other drugs, such as the read-through compounds, allow for production of a normal, or at least functional, protein without correcting the underlying genomic DNA mutation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonsense mutations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A nonsense mutation is a single nucleotide substitution that creates a premature termination (stop) codon (PTC), resulting in a truncated protein that is often unstable <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nonfunctional (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F78399\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78399 \">figure 2</a>). The first compounds identified that could &quot;read-through&quot; PTCs were aminoglycosides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Approximately 14 percent of patients with ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) have nonsense mutations in the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (<em>ATM</em>) gene. As little as 5 to 20 percent of normal levels of ATM is sufficient in some patients with AT to slow neurologic progression. In vitro and ex vivo studies demonstrated that several different aminoglycosides were able to induce PTC read-through, leading to production of functional full-length ATM protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The read-through activity of the drugs appeared to be specific to disease-causing premature stop codons since true termination codons were not affected.</p><p>There are two major limitations to the use of aminoglycosides as read-through compounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The first is that high levels, often cytotoxic, are required. The second is that they often do not efficiently cross the blood-brain barrier.</p><p>Research is now focusing on designing aminoglycosides with increased activity and reduced toxicity and finding alternatives to aminoglycosides to overcome these obstacles. One such alternative is PTC124, a compound that was able to selectively and specifically read-through nonsense mutations of Duchenne muscular dystrophy in ex vivo human and murine models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duchenne-and-becker-muscular-dystrophy-glucocorticoid-and-disease-modifying-treatment#H1729339538\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy: Glucocorticoid and disease-modifying treatment&quot;, section on 'Ataluren'</a>.)</p><p>Alternatively, the underlying single nucleotide substitution can be corrected using zinc-finger proteins. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Frameshift mutations'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Splice-site mutations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A splice-site mutation is a mutation (usually a single nucleotide substitution but may also be an insertion or deletion of a sequence of nucleotides) that disrupts the specific site at which splicing of an intron occurs in pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F60789\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60789 \">figure 3</a>). The result is production of an aberrant protein. Antisense oligonucleotides are able to correct splicing mutations with specific chemical properties by redirect splicing from the mutated splice site to a nearby alternative splice site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/5,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,42</a>]. Antisense morpholino oligonucleotides were successfully used to correct splicing mutations in the <em>ATM</em> gene ex vivo. Efforts are ongoing to improve delivery into cell nuclei and developing compounds that can cross the blood-brain barrier.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Frameshift mutations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A frameshift occurs when a sequence of nucleotides not divisible by three is inserted or deleted. These mutations shift the reading frame for all downstream codons (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F78767\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78767 \">figure 4</a>). Zinc-finger proteins engineered to recognize two DNA regions flanking a mutation can be fused to a nuclease that induces a double-strand break [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/5,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,43</a>]. This DNA cleavage enhances ex vivo homologous recombination between the targeted chromosome and an extrachromosomal DNA donor. In an ex vivo model of X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), this approach yielded genetic modification in approximately 18 percent of human cells, a level sufficient for potential therapeutic effect.</p><p>Another approach under exploration is using antisense oligonucleotides to generate an in-frame deletion to skip a mutation-containing exon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/5,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,44</a>]. The hope is that the resultant shortened protein product will still have at least partial function. Clinical improvement is seen in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy treated with these agents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Missense and in-frame mutations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Missense mutations come in two forms: nonsynonymous, in which the point mutation alters a codon such that a different amino acid is translated, and synonymous or silent, in which the point mutation does not alter the final protein product (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F55798\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55798 \">figure 5</a>). Many of the nonsynonymous missense mutations are probably nondeleterious DNA variants or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). An in-frame mutation occurs when a sequence of nucleotides divisible by three is inserted or deleted. This mutation does not shift the triplet reading frame, but can result in an abnormal protein product.</p><p>Chimeric <span class=\"nowrap\">RNA/DNA</span> oligonucleotides (chimeraplasts) are potential pharmacogenetic agents to treat missense mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gene-therapy-for-primary-immunodeficiency/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The chimeraplast is identical to the mutated region with one exception: The mutated base is replaced with the correct base. The chimeraplast anneals to the mutated region except at the base-pair mismatch. This leads to the activation of the mismatch repair system that corrects the missense mutation. Clinical trials of this method have not yet begun.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H827411933\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Advances in gene transduction protocols and improved viral vectors are needed to increase efficacy and decrease side effects such as lymphoproliferative disorders.

These include read-through compounds for nonsense mutations, antisense oligonucleotides for splice-site and frameshift mutations, zinc-finger nuclease fusion proteins for frameshift mutations, and chimeraplasts for missense mutations. These pharmacogenetic agents are in the early stages of development for primary immunodeficiency disorders.
