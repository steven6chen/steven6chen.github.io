A hernia is defined as a protrusion, bulge, or projection of an organ or a part of an organ through the body wall that normally contains it. Collectively, inguinal and femoral hernias are known as groin hernias. Inguinal hernia is more common than femoral hernia and other abdominal wall hernias (eg, umbilical, epigastric), but femoral hernias present with complications more often [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>The classification, epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of inguinal and femoral hernias will be reviewed. The management of groin hernias (nonsurgical and surgical) is discussed elsewhere.

The prevalence of groin hernias is estimated to be between 5 and 10 percent in the United States. Inguinal hernia is more common than femoral hernia and other abdominal wall hernias (eg, umbilical, epigastric) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although femoral hernias account for less than 10 percent of groin hernias, they present clinically with complications (incarceration, strangulation) more often than inguinal hernias. (See <a href=\"#H606309980\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> below.)</p><p>Hernias are more common in men compared with women and in whites compared with non-whites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

The lifetime risk of developing a groin hernia is approximately 25 percent in men but less than 5 percent in women. Women manifest groin hernias at a later age. In one review, the median age at presentation was 60 to 79 years of age for women compared with 50 to 69 years of age for men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

A large observational study from a Swedish hernia register involving 49,092 patients found a lower prevalence of groin hernia in obesity than in the general population (5 versus 10 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H606318076\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Groin hernias can broadly be classified by etiology (congenital versus acquired) and anatomic location [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Congenital hernias typically occur in the groin, although they may be found in other locations such as the umbilicus or femoral canal. The simplest and most common anatomic system separates groin hernias into direct and indirect inguinal hernias and femoral hernias. </p><p>The term &quot;sports hernia&quot; refers to groin pain related to athletic participation but is not necessarily associated with an anatomic hernia. Sports hernia is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sports-related-groin-pain-or-sports-hernia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sports-related groin pain or 'sports hernia'&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H606310426\"><span class=\"h2\">Etiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hernias are classified by etiology depending upon whether the hernia is due to a congenital defect or is acquired. Congenital hernia is a result of abnormal development whereas acquired hernia is due to alterations of otherwise normally developed tissues that lead to weakening or disruption. Males and females exhibit differences in the anatomic development of structures in the groin, which impacts the nature of hernia each develops.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H368943787\"><span class=\"h3\">Congenital hernia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Congenital inguinal hernia is due to failure of the processus vaginalis to close. The processus vaginalis is an invagination of parietal peritoneum that precedes the migration and descent of the testicles in males. The same invagination occurs in females, and the portion of the processus vaginalis within the inguinal canal is called the &quot;canal of Nuck,&quot; which usually obliterates around the eighth month of fetal life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In males, the gubernaculum (caudal genital ligament) normally migrates through the internal inguinal ring into the inguinal canal and through the external ring into the scrotum to allow descent of the testicle. Later in development, the upper portion of the gubernaculum degenerates and the lower portion remains as the scrotal ligament securing the testicle to the lower part of the scrotum, limiting its mobility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Once the testicle has descended, the internal ring normally closes. Failure of the internal ring to close combined with failure of obliteration of the processus vaginalis provides the necessary defect through which abdominal tissues can pass (eg, small bowel, cecum), which can occur during childhood or not until adulthood. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In females, migration of the gubernaculum does not take place [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The upper portion of the gubernaculum in females forms the suspensory ligament of the ovary; the lower portion of the gubernaculum is bent into an angular form. Cephalic to the bend, it becomes the round ligament of the ovary (ie, ligamentum ovarii proprium) and caudal to it, the round ligament of the uterus (ie, ligamentum teres uteri). Thus, the inguinal component of the gubernaculum remains in females as the round ligament, whereas it degenerates in males. The round ligament runs through the internal ring, through the inguinal canal, and ends in the fat of the labium majora or terminates just outside the external ring without attachment or extension to the labium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. The internal ring is narrower in women and may explain the lower incidence of indirect inguinal hernia in women (see <a href=\"#H606339728\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above). The ligamentous structure found within the inguinal hernia sac in female patients is often erroneously identified as the round ligament. However, detailed anatomic examination identifies this structure as the suspensory ligament of the ovary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], which helps explain the occasional presence of the fallopian tube or ovary in the hernia sac in female patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H606309543\"><span class=\"h3\">Acquired hernia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acquired hernias are due to a weakening or disruption of the fibromuscular tissues of the body wall allowing intra-abdominal contents to protrude through the acquired defect. Acquired groin hernias can develop as a result of inherent connective tissue abnormalities, chronic abdominal wall injury, or possibly drug effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Tissues of the groin may disrupt as a result of inborn or acquired biochemical or metabolic processes that weaken connective tissue due to disturbed collagen metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. A tendency toward hernia formation may be evident in the patient or family history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/3,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,24</a>]. Aortic aneurysmal disease, which is linked to connective tissue abnormalities, is also associated with groin hernia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/15-19,39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-19,39-41</a>]. Although rare, a number of inborn errors of metabolism, such as abnormalities in collagen type I and III synthesis, can be the underlying cause for the development of hernias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Weakening of the tissues may also result from pharmacologic effects. Chronic glucocorticoid administration is associated with thinning of skin and weakening of the soft tissues that may predispose to hernia development. Other factors that affect the integrity of connective tissue include older age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/5,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,12</a>] and smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>].</p><p>Chronic overstretching of the musculoaponeurotic structures due to increased intra-abdominal pressure or abdominal wall injury is another factor contributing to acquired hernia. Elevations in intra-abdominal pressure can also result from chronic cough, constipation, strenuous <span class=\"nowrap\">exercise/activity,</span> and pregnancy. Direct hernias occur with unusual frequency in athletic individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]. The relationship between inguinal hernias and intermittent straining or heavy lifting is not clear; some studies suggest that the incidence of hernia is no higher in professions performing heavy manual labor than in sedentary professions, while others have come to the opposite conclusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/27,46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,46-48</a>]. Pectineus muscle atrophy with age may contribute to femoral hernia formation. The higher incidence of femoral hernia in women may relate to comparatively less baseline muscle bulk compared with men, or a weakening of the musculature from childbirth. However, in one small study, multiple deliveries were not found to be significantly associated with the development of hernia in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H606310492\"><span class=\"h2\">Anatomic location</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Groin hernias are classified according to the anatomic location of the abdominal wall defect. Several classification schemes for groin hernias exist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/28,35,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,35,49</a>], but the simplest and most useful system identifies groin hernias by the anatomic site of the tissue defect separating groin hernias into indirect and direct inguinal hernias and femoral hernias. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Indirect inguinal hernia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Indirect inguinal hernias are the most common type of hernia in males and females. Indirect hernias protrude at the internal inguinal ring, which is the site where the spermatic cord in males and the round ligament in females exits the abdomen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F61841\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61841 \">figure 1</a>). The origin of the hernia sac is located lateral to the inferior epigastric artery. Indirect hernias develop more frequently on the right in both sexes, which is thought to be due, in males, to a later descent of the right testicle and, in females, to the asymmetry of the female pelvis. (See <a href=\"#H368943787\" class=\"local\">'Congenital hernia'</a> above.)</p><p>Most indirect inguinal hernias in adults are congenital, even though they may not be clinically apparent in the neonatal period or childhood. A shutter mechanism, which is postulated to close the internal inguinal ring to a slit, may be dysfunctional in patients with a patent processus vaginalis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52</a>]. Increases in intra-abdominal pressure in association with reduced muscle tone or other connective tissue abnormalities can then force abdominal contents through the widened internal ring into the inguinal canal, resulting in a clinically detectable hernia. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Direct inguinal hernia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Direct inguinal hernias protrude medial to the inferior epigastric vessels within Hesselbach's triangle, which is formed by the inguinal ligament (Poupart's ligament) inferiorly, the inferior epigastric vessels laterally, and the rectus abdominus muscle medially (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F61841\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61841 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Direct inguinal hernias occur as a result of a weakness in the floor of the inguinal canal. This weakness appears to be due to connective tissue abnormalities in many cases, although some may occur due to deficiencies in the abdominal musculature resulting from chronic overstretching or injury. (See <a href=\"#H606309543\" class=\"local\">'Acquired hernia'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Femoral hernia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Femoral hernias are located inferior to the inguinal ligament and protrude through the femoral ring, which is medial to the femoral vein and lateral to the lacunar ligament (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F61841\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61841 \">figure 1</a>). The femoral ring can widen and become patulous with aging and following injury. Femoral hernias are more common in women.</p><p>Although femoral hernias are the least common type of hernia, 40 percent present as emergencies with incarceration or strangulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/3,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12</a>].

Incarcerated or strangulated hernias can present as acute mechanical intestinal obstruction without obvious symptoms or signs of a groin hernia, particularly if the patient is obese. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of mechanical small bowel obstruction in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Women are more likely to present emergently due to a higher incidence of femoral hernias, which are more likely to strangulate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/5,9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9,11</a>]. Another explanation may be that women presenting with hernias are older and exhibit smaller hernia defects due to relatively smaller internal inguinal and femoral rings. In a study from the Swedish hernia registry, emergent hernia repair was needed in 17 percent of the women (53 percent femoral hernias) compared with 5 percent of the men (7 percent femoral hernias) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>A common symptom associated with hernia is a heaviness or dull discomfort in the groin, which may or may not be associated with a visible bulge. Groin hernias in women can also result in vague pelvic discomfort. Moderate-to-severe pain with hernias is unusual and, when present, should raise the possibility of incarceration or strangulation. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Incarceration and strangulation'</a> below.)</p><p>Groin discomfort is most pronounced when intra-abdominal pressure is increased, such as with heavy lifting, straining, or prolonged standing. Very little pressure is needed to create the discomfort, which resolves when the patient stops straining or lies down. This pain is due to constriction of the contents of the hernia (eg, bowel, fat) at the neck of the hernia sac. Typically, discomfort is more prominent at the end of the day or after prolonged standing. Thus, patients who work in manual or physically active professions will notice the discomfort more frequently than sedentary workers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/27,46,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,46,48</a>]. Pain with standing or straining may also arise from stretching of the ilioinguinal nerve, which is typically described as a radiating &quot;twinge&quot; when the nerve is stretched with prompt dissipation of the pain when the stretch is released.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H549554470\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common physical finding in adults is a bulge in the groin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F73484\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73484 \">figure 2</a>). Patients will frequently be aware of the bulge and bring it to the attention of the examiner. In many cases, it is easier and more reliable to demonstrate a hernia bulge with the patient standing, although some hernias, particularly strangulated hernias, can be appreciated while the patient is supine. Two-thirds of groin hernias are located on the right side [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/8,13,53-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,13,53-56</a>]. </p><p>Examination for hernia is best done with the patient standing and the physician seated in front of the patient. Observation of the groin will occasionally reveal an obvious bulge. This can be confirmed as a hernia by placing the hand over the bulge and asking the patient to cough or perform a Valsalva maneuver. When coughing, hernias produce a distinct, soft impulse that increases the protrusion. The sensation is distinct from the firmer impulse that is felt when the intact abdominal wall is tensed with coughing. </p><p>If a visible or palpable hernia is not evident, additional maneuvers in male or female patients include the following: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Male patients &ndash; Many groin hernias in men are obvious on physical examination. Smaller hernias can be identified by invaginating some of the redundant scrotal skin into the inguinal canal, traversing as best as possible the external ring. When the patient is instructed to cough or Valsalva, occult hernias may be felt extending into the canal and touching the tip of the finger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Using the index finger, the examiner places the finger at the base of the scrotum, gently pushing and directing the finger toward the pubic tubercle. The finger will rest adjacent the spermatic cord, and the fingertip will be just within the external ring. There will always be some degree of pressure against the finger with this maneuver, but a true hernia can typically be felt as a &quot;silky&quot; impulse tapping against the finger when the patient coughs or strains. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Female patients &ndash; Groin hernias in women often do not have a visible bulge. Moreover, the examination used in a man (ie, invagination of scrotal skin) is not possible in women. In women, the layers of the abdominal wall absorb the hernia impulse, making the external ring difficult to locate. Ultrasound or diagnostic laparoscopy may be needed to detect hernias in women. (See <a href=\"#H606315346\" class=\"local\">'Identifying occult hernia'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The femoral region should also be examined with particular attention to the area medial to the femoral canal. The space is found by identifying the femoral artery pulsation caudal to the inguinal ligament in the upper portion of the thigh and moving medial from it toward the pubic tubercle. Femoral hernias may be difficult to clinically differentiate from inguinal hernias preoperatively on physical exam when located overlying the inguinal ligament or superior to it. (See <a href=\"#H606315541\" class=\"local\">'Differentiating inguinal from femoral hernia'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Incarceration and strangulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Incarceration refers to trapping of hernia contents within the hernia sac such that reducing them back into the abdomen or pelvis is not possible. Reduced venous and lymphatic flow leads to swelling of the incarcerated tissue, which can be bowel (small, large, appendix), omentum, bladder or ovary, or other structures. As edema accumulates, venous and, ultimately, arterial flow to the contents of the hernia sac can become compromised, resulting in ischemia and necrosis of the hernia contents, which is referred to as strangulation. </p><p>The risk of incarceration and strangulation is overall low, estimated between 0.3 and 3 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/58-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-62</a>]. In two trials that compared elective repair of inguinal hernias with watchful waiting (control), strangulation occurred in the control groups at rates of 1.8 per thousand (0.18 percent) and 7.9 per thousand (0.79 percent) occurrences per patient-year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. Risk factors associated with incarceration and the need for emergent hernia surgery include advancing age, femoral hernia, and recurrent hernia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/58,59,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59,63</a>]. Although all groin hernias can strangulate, femoral hernias appear to be more predisposed to this complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>On physical examination, an incarcerated or strangulated hernia may be painful to palpation. The patient may also be febrile, and erythema of groin skin may be apparent. Strangulated hernias may manifest with symptoms of bowel obstruction, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and bloating, and possibly systemic symptoms if strangulation and bowel necrosis has occurred. Generalized peritonitis typically does not occur since the ischemic or necrotic tissue is trapped within the hernia sac. However, if a strangulated segment of bowel is reduced (spontaneously or unwittingly), generalized peritoneal signs may be present. The clinical manifestations of bowel obstruction are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of mechanical small bowel obstruction in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the majority of cases, a diagnosis of inguinal or femoral hernia can be made based upon history and physical examination, without the need for further studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Although the data are limited, one study reported a sensitivity of 75 percent and specificity of 96 percent for a diagnosis of inguinal hernia on physical exam by surgeons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H549554470\" class=\"local\">'Physical findings'</a> above.)</p><p>When the diagnosis is not apparent, imaging can help to identify occult hernia, differentiate inguinal from femoral hernia, and distinguish hernia from other clinical entities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/66-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-70</a>]. Imaging is also important for evaluating patients for hernia complications. In the absence of suspected intra-abdominal complications, we suggest groin ultrasound as the initial diagnostic modality because it is noninvasive and inexpensive and overall has a high sensitivity and specificity for hernia (confirmed by surgery), particularly in the presence of a palpable mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>], distinguishing hernia from other inguinal and scrotal pathologies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/66,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,70</a>]. Other modalities, including computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and herniography (peritoneography) may be useful under specific clinical circumstances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].

In a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies evaluating occult hernia, ultrasound and herniography (peritoneography) were most often used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Herniography (peritoneography) involves the injection of contrast into the abdominal cavity with subsequent radiographic imaging of the groin region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].

Although herniography may be slightly more accurate, it is invasive and rarely needed given more readily available and noninvasive imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>]. If imaging fails to identify the suspected hernia or an alternative diagnosis, diagnostic laparoscopy can be used to definitively identify or exclude a hernia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. In one study, laparoscopy identified undiagnosed inguinal hernia contralateral to the operative side in 11 percent of the patients undergoing laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].

Watchful waiting may be an option for asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic inguinal hernia but is not recommended for femoral hernia due to the high risk for complications. This issue is discussed in detail elsewhere.

However, in situations when a femoral hernia location cannot be definitively excluded on physical examination, we suggest additional imaging. Ultrasonography of the groin may be particularly useful if confusion exists as to the location of the hernia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernias-in-adults/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. </p><p>CT of the groin region can help differentiate femoral from inguinal hernias.

Congenital hernias are due to lack of closure of the processus vaginalis. Acquired hernias are due to a weakening or disruption of the fibromuscular tissues of the groin. (See <a href=\"#H606318076\" class=\"local\">'Classification and pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Groin hernias are classified by anatomic location as inguinal or femoral.

The sac of indirect hernia protrudes lateral to the epigastric vessels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F61841\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61841 \">figure 1</a>), whereas direct hernias protrude medial to the epigastric vessels through Hesselbach's triangle. Indirect inguinal hernia is the most common type of groin hernia in both men and women. Femoral hernias protrude through the femoral canal.

The most common symptom is a heaviness or dull sense of discomfort with straining or lifting, which is relieved once the pressure is removed. Although femoral hernias are the least common type of hernia, 40 percent present as emergencies with incarceration or strangulation. Older women are more likely to present with a hernia emergency due to a higher incidence of femoral hernia.
