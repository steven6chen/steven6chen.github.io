Bisphosphonates inhibit bone resorption with relatively few side effects. As a result, they are widely used for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis.</p><p>The use of bisphosphonates in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis will be reviewed here. An overview of other treatment options for osteoporosis in women and men is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-osteoporosis-in-men\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of osteoporosis in men&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-premenopausal-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of premenopausal osteoporosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of osteoporosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Bisphosphonates are also used in the management of hypercalcemia, Paget disease, and a number of malignancies, including multiple myeloma, breast cancer, and prostate cancer.

Lifestyle measures include adequate calcium and vitamin D, exercise, smoking cessation, counseling on fall prevention, and avoidance of heavy alcohol use. These measures should be adopted universally to reduce bone loss in postmenopausal women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women&quot;, section on 'Lifestyle measures'</a>.)</p><p>In addition to lifestyle measures, patients at high risk for fracture should receive pharmacologic therapy. Recommendations in whom to initiate pharmacologic therapy are reviewed elsewhere.

We prefer oral bisphosphonates as initial therapy because of their efficacy, favorable cost, and the availability of long-term safety data.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Calcium and vitamin D supplementation in osteoporosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vitamin D deficiency in adults: Definition, clinical manifestations, and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, assessment for comorbidities that may preclude use or alter the administration of bisphosphonates is necessary. For oral bisphosphonates, this typically includes a careful history to detect any abnormalities of the esophagus (stricture, achalasia) and an inability to remain upright for at least 30 to 60 minutes.</p><p>For both oral and IV bisphosphonates, we also inquire about imminent plans for invasive dental procedures (extractions, implants) and discuss risk factors for developing osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), a rare complication of IV or oral therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risks-of-bisphosphonate-therapy-in-patients-with-osteoporosis#H4001385\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risks of bisphosphonate therapy in patients with osteoporosis&quot;, section on 'Osteonecrosis of the jaw'</a>.)</p><p>If a dental implant or extraction is already planned, we frequently delay bisphosphonate therapy for a few months until healing of the jaw is complete. If a patient is already taking bisphosphonates, the approach is uncertain, and there are few data to guide management. Some clinicians ask patients to discontinue bisphosphonates and resume again when healing is complete, while others suggest not stopping bisphosphonates. Guidelines from the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons suggest performing dentoalveolar surgery, such as extractions and implants, as usual in patients who have been treated with oral bisphosphonates for less than four years and have no clinical risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-bisphosphonates-in-postmenopausal-women-with-osteoporosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. They suggest discontinuing bisphosphonates if a patient has been treated for more than four years or has taken concomitant glucocorticoids. This topic is reviewed in more detail separately.

The following regimen is recommended to maximize absorption and minimize the risk of esophageal adverse effects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risks-of-bisphosphonate-therapy-in-patients-with-osteoporosis#H4000461\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risks of bisphosphonate therapy in patients with osteoporosis&quot;, section on 'Gastrointestinal'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bisphosphonates should not be given to patients with active upper GI disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bisphosphonates should be discontinued in patients who develop any symptoms of esophagitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bisphosphonates should be taken alone on an empty stomach first thing in the morning with at least 240 mL (8 oz) of water. After administration, the patient should not have food, drink, medications, or supplements for at least one half-hour (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=alendronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alendronate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risedronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risedronate</a>) or one hour (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibandronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibandronate</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The reason for taking 8 oz of water is to minimize the risk of the tablet getting stuck in the esophagus. The reason for taking the medication while fasting and waiting one half-hour until eating or drinking is that bioavailability may be seriously impaired by ingestion with liquids other than plain water, such as mineral water, coffee, or juice; by retained gastric contents, as with insufficient fasting time or gastroparesis; or by eating or drinking too soon afterwards.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The regimen for enteric-coated, delayed-release <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risedronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risedronate</a> is different from that of other bisphosphonates. The enteric-coated, delayed-release formulation is taken immediately after breakfast with 4 oz of water. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Formulations'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should remain upright (sitting or standing) for at least 30 minutes after administration to minimize the risk of reflux.</p><p/><p>Compliance is also important for optimal fracture reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-bisphosphonates-in-postmenopausal-women-with-osteoporosis/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h4\">Timing of dose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Administration of bisphosphonates first thing in the morning, prior to breakfast, appears to be important for bioavailability and subsequent suppression of bone turnover. This was illustrated in a randomized trial of nursing home residents who were assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risedronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risedronate</a> or placebo between meals (after a two-hour fast) for 12 weeks, rather than before breakfast or the first liquid of the day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-bisphosphonates-in-postmenopausal-women-with-osteoporosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Markers of bone turnover were not suppressed as they typically would be with before-breakfast administration, suggesting that this alternative schedule may not provide the desired effects on BMD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h4\">Calcium/vitamin D</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vitamin D insufficiency and inadequate calcium intake are common in patients with osteoporosis. In the majority of bisphosphonate trials described below, calcium and vitamin D supplements were also administered. Therefore, patients receiving bisphosphonates should take supplemental calcium and vitamin D. However, calcium supplements can interfere with the absorption of bisphosphonates, and they should not be taken for at least one hour after taking oral bisphosphonates. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women&quot;, section on 'Calcium/vitamin D'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Calcium and vitamin D supplementation in osteoporosis&quot;, section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">IV regimen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intravenous (IV) bisphosphonates (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibandronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibandronate</a>) provide an alternative option for patients who cannot tolerate oral bisphosphonates or who have difficulty with dosing requirements, including an inability to sit upright for 30 to 60 minutes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> to swallow a pill. Zoledronic acid is administered yearly and must be infused over a period of at least 30 minutes, whereas ibandronate is administered every three months as a 15- to 30-second IV injection.</p><p>Prior to receiving IV bisphosphonates, patients should be assessed for hypocalcemia, vitamin D deficiency, and renal impairment by measuring serum calcium, creatinine, and 25(OH)D, as described above. (See <a href=\"#H4561856\" class=\"local\">'Pretreatment evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p>Hypocalcemia may occur in patients treated with IV bisphosphonates (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risks-of-bisphosphonate-therapy-in-patients-with-osteoporosis#H4001133\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risks of bisphosphonate therapy in patients with osteoporosis&quot;, section on 'Hypocalcemia'</a>). It is more likely to occur in those individuals with vitamin D deficiency and, therefore, can be minimized by vitamin D and calcium supplementation. Individuals with vitamin D deficiency (25[OH]D &lt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [50 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L])</span> should be treated prior to the infusion, until the serum 25(OH)D level is above 25 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (62 to 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vitamin D deficiency in adults: Definition, clinical manifestations, and treatment&quot;</a>). Some clinicians also advise patients to increase calcium supplementation (doubling of usual dose) for five to seven days starting on the day of the infusion as this may also minimize hypocalcemia, although there are no data to support this practice.</p><p>There have been isolated reports of renal impairment and acute renal failure after <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a> administration, particularly in patients with multiple myeloma but also rarely in those treated for osteoporosis and those receiving concurrent diuretic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-bisphosphonates-in-postmenopausal-women-with-osteoporosis/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. This occurrence may be related to zoledronic acid infusing too rapidly. Prior to each zoledronic acid infusion, clinicians should measure serum creatinine and make sure that patients are adequately hydrated. Zoledronic acid should be infused over a period of at least 30 minutes. In patients taking other nephrotoxic drugs or diuretics, periodic postinfusion measurement of serum creatinine should be considered. Zoledronic acid is not recommended for use in patients with creatinine clearance &le;35 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-bisphosphonates-in-postmenopausal-women-with-osteoporosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

For similar women treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a>, we would continue therapy up to six years. Alendronate, risedronate, and zoledronic acid have demonstrated efficacy for 10, 7, and 6 years, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-bisphosphonates-in-postmenopausal-women-with-osteoporosis/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. However, the potential benefits must be considered in light of the potential risks of long-term therapy. Duration of therapy should be individualized based upon patient characteristics and preferences. This approach is largely consistent with that of a Task Force of the American Society of Bone and Mineral Research [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-bisphosphonates-in-postmenopausal-women-with-osteoporosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>There are few data to guide decisions about duration of therapy. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) performed an analysis of the three major bisphosphonate extension studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-bisphosphonates-in-postmenopausal-women-with-osteoporosis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. In two of these trials (described in detail below), postmenopausal women who had taken bisphosphonates for three to five years were randomly assigned to continue bisphosphonates or switch to placebo, and they were followed for three to five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-use-of-bisphosphonates-in-postmenopausal-women-with-osteoporosis/abstract/17,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,21,22</a>]. Femoral neck BMD was maintained in patients who continued to take bisphosphonates.

As a result, they are widely used for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-osteoporosis-in-men#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of osteoporosis in men&quot;, section on 'Bisphosphonates'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of osteoporosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, we suggest oral bisphosphonates as first-line therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-osteoporosis-in-postmenopausal-women#H11555730\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women&quot;, section on 'Candidates for therapy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We prefer oral bisphosphonates (over other osteoporosis drugs) as initial therapy because of their efficacy, favorable cost, and the availability of long-term safety data. (See <a href=\"#H1068060\" class=\"local\">'Choice of bisphosphonate'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1070891\" class=\"local\">'Overview of available bisphosphonates'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, we suggest either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alendronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alendronate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risedronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risedronate</a> as the initial choice of bisphosphonate (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We most commonly use alendronate. Generic alendronate and risedronate are available in many countries, including the United States. Most patients prefer the convenience of the once-weekly regimen. Although once-monthly oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibandronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibandronate</a> may be more convenient for patients, a reduction in hip fracture risk has not been established, and if the patient likes the once-monthly regimen, risedronate can be given that way.

However, oral bisphosphonates should not be used as initial therapy in patients with esophageal disorders (eg, achalasia, esophageal stricture, Barrett's esophagus), after certain types of bariatric surgery in which surgical anastomoses are present in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (eg, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass), or in patients with an inability to follow the dosing requirements (eg, stay upright for at least 30 to 60 minutes).

The finding of a clinically significant BMD decrease in a treated patient should trigger additional evaluation for contributing factors, which may include poor adherence to therapy, inadequate GI absorption, inadequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, or the development of a disease or disorder with adverse skeletal effects. (See <a href=\"#H1068613\" class=\"local\">'Response to therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alendronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alendronate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risedronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risedronate</a> for five years or who received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a> once yearly for three years, who have a stable BMD, no previous vertebral fractures, and who are at low risk for fracture in the near future, we suggest discontinuing the drug (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4002798\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, for women at highest risk for fracture (history of osteoporotic fracture before or during therapy, T-score below -3.5 in the absence of fractures) who are taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alendronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alendronate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risedronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risedronate</a>, we continue therapy for up to 10 years as clinical trial data show maintenance of BMD and fracture benefits with no increased risk of adverse events. For similar women treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a>, we would continue therapy up to six years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients in whom bisphosphonates have been discontinued, we monitor BMD. We typically restart bisphosphonates when there is persistent bone loss (approximately 5 percent) at the femoral neck on at least two dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) measurements taken at least two years apart, using the same make and model DXA scanner.
