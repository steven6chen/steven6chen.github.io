Because some skin cancers demonstrate aggressive biologic behavior in the setting of immunosuppression, care must be taken to identify and treat early lesions appropriately. In addition to treatments that directly target cutaneous malignancies, modulation of immunosuppression and preventive measures play an important role in the management of these patients. Organ transplant recipients with a history of skin cancer should be followed closely for the development of new lesions, locally recurrent lesions, and metastatic disease.</p><p>The prevention and management of skin cancers in organ transplant recipients will be reviewed here. The epidemiology and risk factors for skin cancers in organ transplant recipients, as well as a summary of other malignancies that develop with increased frequency after solid organ transplantation, are discussed separately.

A careful history of previous skin cancer should also be obtained to determine the appropriate follow-up frequency or the wait time before proceeding to transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-skin-cancer-in-solid-organ-transplant-recipients/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3962131323\"><span class=\"h2\">Wait time</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with a history of prior cutaneous malignancy, the wait time before undergoing transplantation depends upon the tumor type and stage, presence or absence of high-risk features, and availability of a management approach alternative to transplantation.

After a median follow-up time of 4.5 years (range 1.8 to 8.3 years), the skin cancer (squamous cell carcinoma, melanoma, and Merkel cell carcinoma) specific mortality was approximately 35 per 100,000 person-years, a rate nearly nine times higher than that reported for the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-skin-cancer-in-solid-organ-transplant-recipients/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>].

Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most common skin cancer in this population and is often associated with aggressive biologic behavior. Early detection and treatment of cutaneous malignancies, modulation of immunosuppression, and preventive measures play an important role in the management of these patients. (See <a href=\"#H2295753\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A dermatologic consultation is recommended before transplantation for the screening and treatment of skin cancer and precursor lesions. A careful history of previous skin cancer should be obtained to determine whether a wait time is needed before proceeding to transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H2688781920\" class=\"local\">'Pretransplantation screening'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3962131323\" class=\"local\">'Wait time'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The preventive management of skin cancer in organ transplant recipients requires a close collaboration between dermatologists and transplant teams and involves patient education, choice and modulation of the immunosuppressive regimen, and post-transplantation surveillance. (See <a href=\"#H1360550714\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transplant recipients should be counseled on sun avoidance, the use of sunscreens and sun-protective clothing, and the warning signs of cutaneous malignancy. Patients should be instructed to perform a skin self-examination on a monthly basis. (See <a href=\"#H3433536492\" class=\"local\">'Sun protection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because type, intensity, and duration of immunosuppression appear to promote the development of cutaneous malignancies in organ transplant recipients, modification or reduction of immunosuppression may be beneficial for patients who develop numerous lesions, recurrent disease, or metastatic disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F76140\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76140 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3271190564\" class=\"local\">'Choice and modulation of immunosuppressive regimen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemoprevention with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acitretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acitretin</a>&nbsp;may be of benefit in patients who develop multiple or aggressive SCCs. (See <a href=\"#H2413963458\" class=\"local\">'Chemoprevention for SCC'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After transplantation, patients should continue to have total body skin examinations on a regular basis. We typically perform full skin examinations at least once yearly on fair-skinned individuals. More frequent examinations are indicated in patients with a history of actinic keratoses or skin cancer. Daily sun protection should be strongly encouraged. (See <a href=\"#H3891747700\" class=\"local\">'Post-transplantation surveillance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All lesions suspicious for SCC in organ transplant patients should be biopsied and sent for pathologic evaluation. Patients should be staged based on the American Joint Committee on Cancer 7<sup>th</sup> edition criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F78140\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78140 \">table 2</a>) and the alternative Brigham and Women's Hospital staging scheme (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F93401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93401 \">table 4</a>). The treatment of SCCs is based upon the presence or absence of high-risk features. (See <a href=\"#H2025280317\" class=\"local\">'Squamous cell carcinoma'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because SCCs in organ transplant recipients are generally considered high-risk lesions, excisional therapies that provide evaluation of histologic margins are generally preferred. Some clinicians perform electrodesiccation and curettage at the time of biopsy on lesions that are clinically consistent with small, well-differentiated SCCs. If pathology results demonstrate aggressive histopathologic features, subsequent surgical excision should be performed to ensure adequate tumor removal. (See <a href=\"#H2294586\" class=\"local\">'Invasive lesions without additional high-risk features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For SCCs in organ transplant recipients that exhibit additional high-risk features, we suggest treatment with Mohs surgery due to the high cure rates and tissue-sparing effect of this treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). If Mohs surgery is not available, excision with intraoperative frozen sections can be utilized. If neither of these options is feasible, patients can be managed with conventional surgical excision with postoperative margin assessment. (See <a href=\"#H2296293\" class=\"local\">'Invasive lesions with additional high-risk features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Basal cell carcinoma (BCC), melanoma, and Merkel cell carcinoma are managed similarly in organ transplant recipients and immunocompetent patients. Modulation of immunosuppression is the primary treatment for Kaposi sarcoma in organ transplant recipients. There are no definitive guidelines regarding alteration in immunosuppressive regimens in patients with BCC, melanoma, or Merkel cell carcinoma. The risks and benefits of reduction in immunosuppression should be considered carefully. (See <a href=\"#H2294649\" class=\"local\">'Basal cell carcinoma'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2294663\" class=\"local\">'Melanoma'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2294670\" class=\"local\">'Kaposi sarcoma'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2295682\" class=\"local\">'Merkel cell carcinoma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Population-based data on skin cancer mortality among organ transplant recipients are limited. A cohort study including nearly 500,000 patients who received a solid organ transplantation in the Unites States estimated a mortality from all skin cancers, including SCC, melanoma, and Merkel cell carcinoma, of approximately 35 per 100,000 person-years, a rate nearly nine times higher than that reported for the general population.
