Issues related to the pathologic findings and the pathogenesis of infection will be reviewed here. The diagnosis, epidemiology, and management of Chagas disease are discussed in detail separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chagas-disease-acute-and-congenital-trypanosoma-cruzi-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chagas disease: Acute and congenital Trypanosoma cruzi infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chagas-disease-chronic-trypanosoma-cruzi-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chagas disease: Chronic Trypanosoma cruzi infection&quot;</a>.) </p><p>In general, the acute phase consists of parasitemia, generally with nonspecific or no symptoms, and typically lasts 8 to 12 weeks; in a minority of patients, there is inflammation and swelling at the site of inoculation (chagoma). The chronic phase typically begins with a long period of latency (indeterminate form) characterized by lack of objective evidence of organ damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. An estimated 30 percent of these individuals progress over a period of years to decades to clinically evident chronic disease; heart disease develops more commonly than gastrointestinal disease. The clinical aspects of these phases are outlined separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chagas-disease-acute-and-congenital-trypanosoma-cruzi-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chagas disease: Acute and congenital Trypanosoma cruzi infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chagas-disease-chronic-trypanosoma-cruzi-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chagas disease: Chronic Trypanosoma cruzi infection&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute phase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Organ damage during the acute phase occurs as a result of high grade parasitemia and direct tissue parasitism. Affected sites typically include the heart, gastrointestinal tract (mainly esophagus and colon), and central nervous system. Lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly are markers of widespread immunologic reaction, which leads to control of the acute infection but probably exacerbates tissue damage. Histopathology during the acute phase demonstrates intense parasitism in every involved organ system, with prominent inflammatory changes in the vicinity of ruptured infected cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/2-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-7</a>].</p><p>All four cardiac chambers may become dilated, and pericardial effusion is common. Myocarditis is intense and diffuse with myocyte necrosis, interstitial edema, vascular dilation, and mononuclear and polymorphonuclear infiltration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F53306\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53306 \">picture 1</a>). The inflammatory process may extend to the endocardium, resulting in thrombus formation. Involvement also includes the conduction system as well as the intramural and extracardiac neuronal ganglia.</p><p>In the esophagus and colon, parasitism and inflammation involve the smooth muscle and the neurons of the Meissner and Auerbach's plexuses. Vasculitis has been described in animal models of the disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F71304\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71304 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Macroscopic signs of inflammation are also detectable in the meninges and central and peripheral nervous tissues.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic phase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 30 percent of individuals with the indeterminate form of Chagas disease progress over years to decades to clinically evident disease. Autopsy examination typically demonstrates ventricular aneurysms, cardiomegaly, megaesophagus, and megacolon; less frequent manifestations include dilatation of the upper gastrointestinal tract, ureters, and bronchi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/2-6,8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6,8-10</a>]. In patients who die after the clinical onset of heart failure, there is dilatation and an increase in cardiac weight. Signs of systemic congestion (jugular vein distention, ascites, hepatomegaly, and peripheral edema) usually predominate over pulmonary congestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The most characteristic cardiac lesion is ventricular apical aneurysm. In one series of 1078 autopsies, this finding was noted in 52 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Even in the absence of a discrete aneurysm or left ventricular enlargement, patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy may have a left ventricular apical deformation that results in disruption of the normal anatomic shape [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Another typical location involves the inferior or posterior basal region of the left ventricle and is associated with the development of malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Chagasic apical aneurysms are extremely thin and rarely rupture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52771\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52771 \">picture 3</a>). In contrast to left ventricular aneurysms developing after acute myocardial infarction, the chagasic apical aneurysm does not exhibit significant fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13</a>]. There is no relation between the frequency of apical aneurysm and age or cardiac weight. Aneurysms have been observed in patients who died suddenly with no antecedent clinical manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Intracardiac mural thrombosis in various stages of organization was found in over one-third of autopsy cases of chronic Chagas heart disease with heart failure; the right and left heart chambers were equally affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Pulmonary and systemic thromboembolism were detected in almost 50 percent of autopsy cases of chronic Chagas heart disease. Although systemic infarcts were more common (primarily involving the kidneys, spleen, and brain), pulmonary embolism caused more deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chagas-heart-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chagas heart disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Histologic examination using hematoxylin-eosin staining demonstrates mild chronic myocarditis manifested by scattered mononuclear cell infiltrates with the surrounding myocytes undergoing various stages of degeneration and necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8</a>]. Since intact parasites or even parasite remnants are rarely detected in humans or in experimental models of Chagas disease when conventional histologic techniques are used, the role of <em>T. cruzi</em> in the pathogenesis of chronic lesions has been previously underestimated. By using more sensitive techniques, the involvement of the parasite in the chronic phase of Chagas disease has been well documented. Immunohistochemical techniques targeting anti-<em>T. cruzi</em> antibodies demonstrate topographic correlation between these findings and inflammatory foci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. In addition, <em>T. cruzi</em> genomic fragments have been identified with polymerase chain reaction methods in the areas of myocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-20</a>].</p><p>Small areas of focal fibrosis are diffusively scattered, involving both the myocardium and the conduction system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The right bundle branch and the left anterior fascicle of the left bundle are preferentially involved by inflammatory and fibrotic changes; these findings explain the frequent clinical occurrences of right bundle branch block and left anterior fascicular block [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Microvascular changes include decapillarization, interstitial edema, intravascular platelet aggregation, and thickening of the vascular basement membrane.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H107070344\"><span class=\"h3\">Indeterminate form</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endomyocardial biopsy in the setting of indeterminate disease demonstrates degenerative changes in approximately 60 percent of patients. The findings are less severe than in patients with overt cardiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. These results are comparable with those observed in the canine model of <em>T. cruzi</em> chronic infection, showing small foci of mild, chronic myocarditis, with interstitial edema, mild fibrosis, and infiltration by lymphocytes, macrophages, and plasma cells, and indicating a self-limited cycle of focal inflammatory changes, with modulation and suppression of cell-mediated immune responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A study using an in vitro experimental model to observe <em>T. cruzi</em> passage through the vascular barrier found that the parasite does not cause disruption of the endothelial monolayer, but uses a special transmigration process that is facilitated by bradykinin and CCL2 chemokine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Target organ damage during the acute phase is closely related to high grade parasitemia, direct intense tissue parasitism, and the immunoinflammatory response to the parasite, manifesting particularly in the heart, gastrointestinal tract, and central nervous system. Lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly are markers of widespread immunologic reaction that, through several innate mechanisms, act to detect and control parasite tissue invasion. Investigations using animal models of <em>T. cruzi</em> infection described the initial immunological reaction involving the activation of CD4<sup>+</sup>, CD8<sup>+</sup> T, and B cells that induce direct antitrypanosoma cytotoxicity, as well as the cytokine secretion and production of specific antibodies against the parasite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic cardiac disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of chronic Chagas heart disease has not been fully elucidated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. It has been hypothesized that as the parasitemia and systemic inflammatory reaction subside at the end of the acute phase, a low-grade but incessant, silent focal myocarditis persists during the indeterminate phase, with cumulative destruction of cardiac fibers and reparative fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. This process is likely responsible for progressive loss of myocardial mass that leads to cardiac dilation, marked reparative and reactive fibrosis, and the development of malignant ventricular arrhythmias. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chagas-heart-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chagas heart disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Arrhythmias'</a>.)</p><p>Four mechanisms are thought to contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic Chagas heart disease: neurogenic mechanisms, microvascular derangements, parasite-dependent inflammation, and immune-mediated injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>The first two mechanisms may only represent ancillary pathogenetic factors for the induction of Chagas cardiomyopathy. In contrast, the last two of these mechanisms seem to be critically dependent on a previously neglected factor for the installation and progression of chronic myocarditis: parasite persistence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Neurogenic mechanisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with Chagas disease have evidence of impaired autonomic function and neuronal depopulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Parasympathetic dysfunction has been observed in the early phases of Chagas disease and in many patients precedes left ventricular dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. No clear correlation has been established between autonomic derangement and the extent of left ventricular dysfunction. In addition, the degree of autonomic impairment does not appear to correlate with prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Impaired sympathetic innervation has been shown to contribute to the progression of myocardial damage, as suggested by overlap between regions of impaired ventricular sympathetic function, myocardial perfusion defects, and regional wall motion abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Scant evidence is available on the pathophysiologic role of autonomic dysfunction in Chagas disease. It has been hypothesized that parasympathetic dysautonomia may trigger malignant arrhythmia and sudden death, disturb control of the coronary microcirculation, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> exacerbate the mechanical consequences of ventricular dyssynergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In a study of patients with mild left ventricular dysfunction, the detection of sustained ventricular tachycardia was associated with larger areas of viable but adrenergically denervated myocardium identified by using MIBG-I123 scintigraphy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. A pathophysiological link between impaired parasympathetic regulation and abnormal neuroimmunomodulatory mechanism has been suggested on the basis of the protective effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyridostigmine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pyridostigmine</a>, a cholinesterase inhibitor, in an experimental model of chronic Chagas heart disease in mice. Cholinergic stimulation caused a significant reduction of myocardial inflammation, fibrosis, and hypertrophy, accompanied by a decrease in serum levels of IFN-gamma, and no change in IL-10<strong> </strong>levels. These results suggest that autonomic dysregulation caused by <em>T. cruzi</em> infection could disrupt the anti-inflammatory role played by the parasympathetic nervous system during chronic Chagas heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H285745237\"><span class=\"h3\">Microvascular derangements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Coronary microvascular abnormalities have been described in patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy as well as in animal models of infection with <em>T. cruzi</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/34,37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,37-39</a>]. These abnormalities may amplify and perpetuate myocardial damage associated with inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Experimental data suggest that endothelin-1, a potent vasoconstrictor and proinflammatory cytokine, may be involved in the microvascular dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Abnormal reactivity to vasodilator and vasoconstrictor stimuli has been described in the epicardial coronary arteries of patients with Chagas disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. It has been postulated that such abnormalities contribute to ischemic-like symptoms, electrocardiographic changes, and perfusion defects described in patients with Chagas disease and angiographically normal coronary arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. A longitudinal investigation in 36 patients using Tc-99msestamibi myocardial perfusion scans showed that deterioration of left ventricular systolic function over time was associated with both the presence of reversible ischemic defects at the initial assessment and an increase in the extent of fixed perfusion defects during long-term follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Moreover, coalescent microinfarctions are thought to evolve into the typical Chagas disease-related ventricular aneurysms occurring in watershed coronary areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Given the above described evidence regarding microcirculatory derangements producing ischemic myocardial damage, it has been postulated that therapeutic interventions aimed at correcting microvascular abnormalities will improve the prognosis of Chagas cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Parasite-dependent inflammation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic Chagas disease is characterized by sparse inflammatory infiltrates, minimal parasitemia, and low-grade tissue parasitism. Nonetheless, <em>T. cruzi</em> antigens have been identified in inflammatory foci in biopsy and autopsy specimens of patients with chronic Chagas disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. </p><p>There is growing consensus that parasite persistence plays a major role in the development of chronic cardiomyopathy, as suggested by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Experimental models have demonstrated correlation between the tissue parasite burden and the intensity of the inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

Circulating <em>T. cruzi</em> DNA was detectable by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in subjects with well-defined Chagas disease; 86 percent of these patients presented with chronic cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A systematic review of studies of antitrypanosomal therapy for chronic asymptomatic <em>T. cruzi</em> infection (including six randomized controlled trials, four non-randomized studies, and three observational studies) found low-quality and inconsistent evidence of reduction in progression of chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Efficacy data on clinical outcomes were largely from observational studies. Reductions in progression of chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy were evaluated in four studies with 106 events (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.32 to 1.73, I<sup>2 </sup>= 66 percent) and reductions in mortality were evaluated in six studies with 99 events (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.26 to 1.14, I<sup>2</sup> = 48 percent).</p><p/><p>Phenotype and genotype diversity noted among <em>T. cruzi</em> strains, comprising TcI to TcVI6 classes based on their discrete typing units [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>], may be responsible for the remarkable differences detected in the pathological and clinical manifestations of Chagas disease (eg, virtual absence of gastrointestinal disease or discrepant incidence of sudden death) in various geographical regions. It is also plausible that <em>T. cruzi</em> strain diversity may be related to the inconsistent response to several trypanocidal therapies in experimental and clinical studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Immune-mediated tissue injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is ample evidence from both experimental and clinical investigations that immune-mediated cardiac injury by infiltrating mononuclear cells and release of damaging cytokines is a key mechanism for the development of chronic Chagas heart disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F53306\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53306 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

Most investigators now believe that immune pathological responses are directly dependent on parasite persistence and constitute a crucial mechanism for the development of chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/58-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-63</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H285746400\"><span class=\"h2\">The immunopathology of chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This is a complex and multifactorial process, and probably involves several interactive pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].<strong> </strong>It consists of several features, as summarized below, and still bears some important unanswered questions.</p><p>The inflammatory lesions found in the myocardium of patients and animals chronically infected with the <em>T. cruzi</em> exhibit the typical composition of macrophages and a predominant profile of CD8+ over the CD4+ Th1 cells. The inflammatory process is triggered by the recognition of either <em>T. cruzi</em> <span class=\"nowrap\">antigen/DNA</span> or cross-reactive myocardium antigens detected in the heart of animals and patients with the indeterminate or chronic cardiomyopathy forms of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. That some degree of beneficial immunological control is operative in patients with chronic Chagas disease is highlighted by observations of reactivation in the setting of immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/29,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,49</a>]. However, it acts as a double-edged sword because the chronic cardiac form is represented by a delayed-type, cell-mediated diffuse myocarditis that probably ensues when the immunological suppressive mechanisms, operative during the indeterminate phase to reach an equilibrium between the host and parasite, become defaulted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p>The release of several proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines has been shown to be augmented in the setting of clinical and experimental chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy, including IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta, IL-2, IL-12, IL-18, CCL2, CCL4, CCL5, CCR2, CCR5, CXCL9(mRNA), CXCL10, CXCR3, and CXR3(mRNA). Among those, IFN-gamma has been suggested to play a crucial dual role during the chronic phase of <em>T. cruzi</em> infection, both curtailing parasitism, but also entailing myocardial damage through immunological and non-immunological effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. A study used the anti-TNF-alpha antibody, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a>, in chronically <em>T. cruzi</em>-infected <span class=\"nowrap\">C*+BL/6</span> mice to show a favorable reshaping of the immune response with reduced TNF mRNA expression in the cardiac tissue and plasma TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma levels, and a lower incidence of cardiac arrhythmias. These investigators concluded that the inhibition of the TNF-alpha activity may constitute a potential therapeutic target to reverse immunological imbalance and avert cardiac abnormalities in the chronic phase of Chagas disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>In contrast, there is lower production of IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, IL-15, and IL-17. A study using flow cytometry analysis also showed higher numbers of Treg CD4+IL-17+ cells in the peripheral blood from patients with or without mild cardiomyopathy, in comparison with patients with moderate or severe cardiomyopathy, suggesting that the increased levels of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, in association with reduced production of the cytokines IL-10 and IL-17, are the expression of an immunological imbalance related to deficient suppressor activity of regulatory T cells that otherwise would act to control myocardial inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].<strong> </strong>Additional studies comparing chronic Chagas heart disease patients and patients with noninflammatory cardiomyopathy and transplant donors, using quantitative PCR methods, disclosed upregulation of expression of IFN-gamma and transcription factor T-bet in Chagas patients. The Th1 genes thus upregulated in the chagasic myocardium were not opposed by similar upregulation of the expression of<strong> </strong>cytokines expressed by TH2 cells (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13) or associated with Treg (TGF-beta and IL-10) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p>Immunopathology in chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy is influenced by genetic polymorphisms of the host, thus modulating the expression of immune inhibitory molecules and potentially altering the equilibrium between host and parasite. For example, alleles, genotypes, and haplotypes associated with enhancement of the regulatory CTLA-4 system expression have been shown to predominate in patients with the indeterminate form of Chagas disease, probably averting the development of cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. In contrast, a genetic and proteomic study was conducted in 118 chagasic patients who were asymptomatic and in 315 patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy, and documented that polymorphism in the alfa cardiac actin-1 gene (ACTC1) was associated with an increased susceptibility to maintain an inflammatory status, possibly by modulating transcription factor binding to ACTC1 promoter regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. These results and others from several investigators are considered to confirm previous evidence of familial aggregation of cases with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy, and are also compatible with the classic observation that only approximately one-third of infected patients develop the clinical complications of the disease, strongly indicating the possibility that indeed a genetic component is linked to disease susceptibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p>A major unanswered question is why some patients remain in the indeterminate form of the disease throughout their lives while others develop clinical manifestations of chronic infection. It also remains unclear why the human immune system is not capable of sterilizing the organism.<strong> </strong>One hypothesis is that parasite persistence could be caused not only by a defective immune response, but also by the parasite&rsquo;s ability to remain unnoticed within myocardial and other structural cells, hence escaping the effector activity of cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3237136\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastrointestinal disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Digestive organ involvement in the chronic phase is thought to occur mainly as a result autonomic neuronal depopulation and nerve degeneration in esophageal and colon tissues during the acute phase (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F66813\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef66813 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/5,9,74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9,74,75</a>].
