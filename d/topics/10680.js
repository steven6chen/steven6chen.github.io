It is caused by infection with the measles virus. This virus spreads very easily from person to person.</p><p>There is a vaccine (that comes in a shot) that keeps people from getting measles. It is called the MMR vaccine. It protects against 3 different infections: measles, mumps, and rubella. People need 2 doses of the MMR vaccine to protect against measles.</p><p>People who are at risk for measles include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children too young to get a measles shot</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People who have never had a measles shot</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People who did not get a second measles shot</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People who got a shot that did not work well</p><p/><p>Going to countries where measles shots are not common, or being around people from these countries, can raise the risk of getting measles.</p><p>Measles can cause long-term problems with the lungs, ears, or brain. These problems can be dangerous. People can die from measles and the problems it causes.</p><p>Some people have a higher risk of serious problems from measles. They include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People with <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS</span> or cancer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnant women</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People who do not get enough food or vitamins</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Babies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Very old people</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15263637\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of measles?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever &ndash; Up to 104&ordm;F (40&ordm;C)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling sick, like with a cold</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of appetite</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spots in the mouth &ndash; These can look like grains of salt.</p><p/><p>After the first symptoms, many people have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Red, runny eyes. The eyes might also be extra sensitive to bright light.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sneezing and coughing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A red rash that starts on the face and spreads to the body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F83849\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83849 \">picture 1</a>). The spots in the rash can form red patches.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A sore throat</p><p/><p>Most people start feeling better about 2 days after the rash starts. After 3 or 4 days, the rash starts to turn brown and go away. The skin might peel or flake off, like after a sunburn. Many people have a cough for 1 or 2 weeks after the rash goes away.</p><p>Some people who get measles have other symptoms, such as a headache, chest pain, or breathing problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15263652\"><span class=\"h1\">How does measles spread?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have not had measles or the MMR vaccine, you can catch measles from an infected person. This can happen if you are around an infected person or go somewhere an infected person has been.</p><p>A person with measles can start spreading it about 5 days before he or she gets a rash. It can spread for about 4 days after the rash is gone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15263669\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I call the doctor or nurse if I think my child or I have measles?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you or your child has a fever and rash, call the doctor or nurse. He or she can ask questions and tell you what to do next. Don't go to the doctor's office without calling first. Measles spreads easily, so you could give it to other people at the doctor's office.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15263684\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I was near someone with measles?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you or your child has not had the MMR vaccine, call the doctor or nurse. It might still be possible to avoid getting sick. If you get it soon enough, the vaccine can stop measles or make it less serious. People who cannot get the vaccine can take a medicine that can help keep them from getting sick.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15263701\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for measles?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The doctor or nurse can do blood tests to check for measles. But these tests might not be needed. A doctor or nurse can often tell if a person has measles by doing an exam and learning about the symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15263716\"><span class=\"h1\">How is measles treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most people, there is no specific treatment. If you or your child have it, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rest</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drink plenty of fluids</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol) to help with fever and aches.</p><p/><p>Do not give <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> or medicines that contain aspirin to children younger than 18. In children, aspirin can cause a serious problem called Reye syndrome.</p><p>Doctors give <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">vitamin A</a> to some children with measles. If your child needs treatment in the hospital, or has another health condition besides measles, the doctor might give vitamin A.</p><p>If measles causes other health problems, such as ear infections, doctors can usually treat them. But a few health problems from measles can be life-threatening.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15263731\"><span class=\"h1\">Can measles be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The MMR vaccine prevents infection.</p><p>All children should get the MMR vaccine when they are 12 to 15 months old. Then they need a second shot when they are 4 to 6 years old. A child should have the second shot before he or she starts school. Some babies and children need to get the vaccine earlier than usual, if they:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Live in an area where there is a measles outbreak</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Need to travel to an area where there is a measles outbreak</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Need to travel outside of the United States</p><p/><p>Some older children and adults also need the MMR vaccine, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hospital or health care workers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Students who don't have written proof of 2 shots</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People traveling outside the United States who don't have written proof of 1 shot</p><p/><p>Some people in the US got a vaccine that did not work well. If you got a measles shot before 1968, talk to your doctor or nurse.</p><p>Some people should wait or get tested before getting the MMR vaccine. This includes people with <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS</span> or cancer and people taking certain medicines.</p><p>The MMR vaccine has a small amount of gelatin and an antibiotic. If you or your child have any allergies, or had a bad reaction to a vaccine, tell your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15263746\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want to get pregnant, be sure your MMR vaccine is up-to-date. This means knowing if you got it in the past. If you are not sure, your doctor or nurse can do a blood test to check.</p><p>Getting measles when you are pregnant could cause a miscarriage. This is when a pregnancy ends before a woman has been pregnant for 20 weeks. Or the baby could be born too early. Babies who are born early can have serious life-long health problems.</p><p>The MMR vaccine must be given before pregnancy. After you get it, wait at least 4 weeks before trying to get pregnant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15263761\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-babies-and-children-age-0-to-6-years-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for babies and children age 0 to 6 years (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-and-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines and pregnancy (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=why-does-my-child-need-vaccines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Why does my child need vaccines?
