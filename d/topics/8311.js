Homeopathic preparations (&quot;remedies&quot;) generally begin with minerals, plants, or animal substances that are pulverized, mixed with a water-alcohol solution, and then potentized, usually well past the point at which any of the original substance remains. The resulting diluent is applied to a sucrose pill and allowed to dry.</p><p>Current evidence finds that homeopathic remedies are no more effective than placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homeopathy/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p>This topic will focus on the practice of homeopathy in adults.

While translating William Cullen's Materia Medica into German, Hahnemann was bothered by Cullen's explanation for how cinchona bark (one of the few effective medicines at the time) cured malaria. According to Cullen, cinchona worked by the &quot;strengthening power it exerts on the stomach&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homeopathy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Doubting this explanation, Hahnemann decided to try some himself. He experienced palpitations, anxiety, trembling, and diffuse joint stiffness (but not fever) lasting two to three hours each time he ingested cinchona [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homeopathy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. He reported feeling well afterwards. It was this experience that led Hahnemann to conclude &quot;similia similibus curentur&quot; or &quot;like cures like.&quot; Hahnemann's explanation was that if two diseases with similar symptoms strike a patient, the &quot;stronger&quot; disease will invariably cure the weaker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homeopathy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Thus, by simulating the symptoms of a disease, homeopathic medicines &quot;substitute themselves for the natural morbid affection, and thereby deprive the latter of all influence upon the vital force.&quot; Moreover, &quot;all medicines cure, without exception, those diseases whose symptoms most nearly resemble their own.&quot;</p><p>Hahnemann's cinchona experience was his only experimental basis for &quot;like cures like.&quot; Subsequent discoveries have disproved his conclusion: The active therapeutic ingredient in cinchona is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinine</a>, which kills the parasite that causes malaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homeopathy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12915844\"><span class=\"h2\">Potentization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The second fundamental tenet of homeopathy, &quot;potentization&quot; (also called &quot;attenuation&quot; or &quot;dynamization&quot;), holds that serial dilutions and succussions (shakings) render a remedy increasingly potent, even well past the point at which a molecule of the original substance can remain. At the time of his cinchona experiment, Hahnemann was prescribing the usual doses of commonly used 18<sup>th</sup> century medicines, many of which (eg, arsenic, mercury, belladonna) were highly toxic. Their adverse effects were thought necessary to rid the body of &quot;the poison&quot; of various maladies. Hahnemann soon decided, in keeping with &quot;like cures like,&quot; that rather than elicit the usual toxic manifestations, he needed to give a dose just large enough to produce an indication of the expected &quot;artificial malady&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homeopathy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. For unclear reasons, he subsequently reduced the doses much further and introduced the serial 10 and 100-fold dilutions that became the norm for homeopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homeopathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H12915879\" class=\"local\">'Preparation of remedies'</a> below.)</p><p>Potentization lends itself to laboratory investigations comparing ultra-dilute homeopathic preparations to diluent for chemical or biological activity. A famous 1988 investigation purported to demonstrate that dilutions of anti-IgE (up to 10<sup>120</sup>), compared to diluent, led to basophilic histamine release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homeopathy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The study was flawed, and the initial results could not be reproduced by independent research teams [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homeopathy/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].</p><p>The concept of potentization violates basic scientific principles and defies logic. Any explanation of how potentization works must account for retention of a specific effect as the dilution approaches and surpasses the point at which the original substance has disappeared completely. It must also account for how that effect is transferred to a sucrose or lactose pill, which is then allowed to dry, bathed in saliva and gastric juices, transported through bowel wall into the bloodstream, and delivered to a site of therapeutic action with its specific biologic activity not merely intact, but amplified. It also must explain how the pill lacks effects referable to contaminants, which, if homeopathic theory is correct, must include every substance on the planet that has ever been in contact with the water used for dilutions.</p><p>Modern homeopaths argue that the diluent somehow retains a memory or imprint of the &quot;formative intelligence&quot; specific to the original substance of interest. Much effort has been spent attempting to show that liquid water has &quot;changeable structure&quot; or &quot;coherence patterns&quot; that are somehow specified by that original substance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homeopathy/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12915861\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRACTICE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After its invention in Germany, homeopathy enjoyed considerable popularity throughout the Western world for most of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, when medicine at the time was also pre-scientific and frequently harmful. With the development of scientific medicine in the late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries, homeopathy became a fringe practice in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homeopathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], making a slight resurgence during the recent public interest in &quot;alternative&quot; treatments. The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) found that 1.8 percent of adults and 1.3 percent of children in the United States used homeopathic remedies in 2007, but the report did not distinguish between those who consulted practitioners and those who merely purchased &quot;over-the-counter&quot; preparations labeled &quot;homeopathic&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homeopathy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. A subsequent NHIS survey reported that among United States adults in 2012, 2.1 percent had used homeopathic preparations in the previous 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homeopathy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Homeopathy is more widely used in Europe and Asia than in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homeopathy/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12915879\"><span class=\"h2\">Preparation of remedies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most homeopathic preparations begin with a mineral, plant, or animal substance, which is pulverized and mixed with a water-alcohol solution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homeopathy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Many of these substances are highly toxic in their initial concentrations. Each preparation then undergoes potentization, consisting of serial dilutions and succussions.</p><p>Dilutions range from 10<sup>6</sup>-fold to 10<sup>1,000,000</sup>-fold (preparations diluted beyond 10<sup>23 </sup>are called &quot;ultra-dilute,&quot; &quot;ultra-molecular,&quot; &quot;ultra-high dilutions,&quot; or &quot;homeopathic potencies&quot;). Homeopathic potencies are designated by the Roman numerals &quot;X&quot; or &quot;C,&quot; according to whether each dilution is 10-fold or 100-fold, respectively, and by a coefficient that represents the number of such steps. Thus, a 12X remedy has been diluted 10<sup>12</sup> times; a 15C remedy has been diluted 100<sup>15</sup> times. Once potentized, most remedies are completed by applying a drop of the liquid to a small lactose or sucrose pellet, which is then allowed to dry. The final dilution is often made with at least 70 percent alcohol, in order to avoid dissolving the pill [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homeopathy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Remedies can also be prepared and administered in injectable, liquid or topical forms.</p><p>Although the substances are usually diluted past the point of possible danger, toxins or toxic contaminants have been found in some homeopathic preparations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homeopathy/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15762022\"><span class=\"h2\">&quot;Provings&quot;</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assertions of useful homeopathic preparations are based on &quot;provings&quot; (also known as &quot;homeopathic pathogenic trials&quot;): a homeopath gives a preparation to one or more healthy subjects who each keep a detailed diary of every sensation, feeling, mood change, and physical change that occurs over the next several days to months. All such symptoms, no matter how vague or seemingly trivial, are presumed to have been caused by the remedy that preceded them. Hahnemann performed his first few provings with undiluted substances, but eventually used &quot;homeopathic potencies,&quot; which continue to be the norm. To a homeopath, &quot;symptoms&quot; are quite different from what modern clinicians might expect. Examples include &quot;dreams which are not remembered&quot; or a &quot;tickling sensation on the palm which obliges a person to scratch&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homeopathy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Such symptoms are compiled and the aggregate result is published in a Materia Medica, in which remedies are listed alphabetically and matched to corresponding symptoms. There are typically thousands of symptoms reported for each substance. About half of the 1300 entries in the US Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia are based on &quot;provings&quot; that occurred during the 19<sup>th</sup> century; about 65 are attributable to Hahnemann himself, including most of those commonly prescribed by homeopaths today [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homeopathy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Provings, a sine qua non of homeopathic practice, suggest that &quot;provers&quot; ought to be able to distinguish between a homeopathic preparation and a placebo. Several randomized trials have failed to support this hypothesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homeopathy/abstract/25-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1042762122\"><span class=\"h2\">Choosing remedies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The inverse of the Materia Medica is the Repertory, in which symptoms are listed alphabetically and matched to corresponding remedies. Repertories are no less voluminous than are Materia Medica. The practicing homeopath, after eliciting a litany of symptoms from a patient, determines the correct remedy by finding the most closely matching symptom group in a Materia Medica, aided by a Repertory. This process is the basis for homeopaths' assertion that they treat the individual rather than the disease. Thus homeopaths are likely to choose any one of several different remedies for what modern physicians would recognize as the same disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homeopathy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>The following treatments are examples from an abbreviated Materia Medica for earache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homeopathy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belladonna &ndash; &quot;for the earache that comes on suddenly and with great intensity.

If the homeopathic prescribing scheme is valid, there should be some agreement among experienced homeopaths regarding choices of remedies, but studies have shown poor interrater reliability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homeopathy/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12915887\"><span class=\"h2\">Contemporary homeopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other than gradual additions to the homeopathic pharmacopoeia, homeopathy has changed little since the time of Hahnemann.</p><p>The influences of two other 19<sup>th</sup> century homeopaths, however, are worth mentioning. Constantine Hering (1800-1880), the &quot;father of American homeopathy,&quot; is usually credited with having promulgated &quot;Hering's Law of Cure&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homeopathy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The human body seeks to externalize disease and dislodge it from more serious internal levels to more superficial external levels. Thus, someone with asthma may develop an external skin rash as part of the curative process.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Healing progresses from the top of the body to the bottom. Thus, someone with arthritis in many joints will generally notice relief in the upper part of the body before the lower part.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Healing proceeds in the reverse order of the symptoms. Thus, the most recent symptoms will generally be the first to be healed, and in the process of cure a person may re-experience previous symptoms.</p><p/><p>Hering's &quot;third law&quot; is the basis for the common homeopathic claim that an &quot;aggravation&quot; occurring shortly after a patient takes a remedy is not to be viewed as evidence of treatment failure, but as proof that the remedy chosen must have been the correct one [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homeopathy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. A systematic review of placebo-controlled trials, however, found that aggravations are uncommon and are no more likely to be found in the homeopathic treatment group than in the placebo group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homeopathy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Hering also introduced what would become known as &quot;isopathy,&quot; which is the use of potentized venoms or &quot;nosodes&quot; (diseased animal parts) to cure or prevent diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homeopathy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Hering was the first homeopath to declare his opposition to vaccination, which he called &quot;poisoning&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homeopathy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Opposition to immunizations remains widespread among homeopaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homeopathy/abstract/39-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-42</a>].</p><p>James Tyler Kent (1849-1916) popularized homeopathic &quot;constitutional remedies&quot; based on stable patient characteristics such as body type, eating preferences, and personality, rather than on acute symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homeopathy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Hering and Kent added the necessary bases for homeopathy's current claim to be a &quot;whole medical system&quot; that not only cures acute diseases, but also prevents infectious diseases and promotes general health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homeopathy/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].</p><p>Large variation currently exists in how homeopathy is practiced. Many contemporary homeopaths have promoted homeopathic methods for preventing or curing numerous infectious diseases, including influenza, small pox, anthrax, malaria, gonorrhea, syphilis, tuberculosis, and AIDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homeopathy/abstract/46-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-49</a>]. Some homeopaths consider themselves to be &quot;classical&quot; homeopaths, practicing according to Hahnemann's rules of never mixing homeopathy with other medicine and never giving more than one medicine at a time. Others assert that homeopathy may be combined with modern medicine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homeopathy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Still others, including many chiropractors and most naturopaths, use homeopathy along with other alternative treatments. All naturopathic schools stress homeopathy in their programs, and many naturopaths are primarily homeopaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homeopathy/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12915949\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL EVIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Meta-analyses of randomized trials have failed to demonstrate that homeopathic preparations are effective treatments for any disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homeopathy/abstract/1-3,52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,52-54</a>]. Many small randomized trials of lower quality have reported statistically significant results suggesting a modest benefit of homeopathic remedies compared to placebos [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homeopathy/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. The larger and more rigorous trials tend to refute these findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homeopathy/abstract/2,3,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,53</a>]. &quot;Positive&quot; results of homeopathy are more likely to be due to bias and error than to specific effects of homeopathic preparations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homeopathy/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>].

The MHRA, however, does not require homeopathic medicines to meet any standards on efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homeopathy/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].</p><p>Homeopathy is also part of the national health care systems of India, Mexico, Brazil, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homeopathy/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12916017\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Homeopathy is based on two tenets: &quot;like cures like,&quot; which holds that the correct remedy is one that produces symptoms similar to those of the patient; and &quot;potentization,&quot; which holds that serial dilutions and succussions (shakings) render a remedy increasingly potent. Subsequent discoveries have disproved the theory of &quot;like cures like,&quot; and there is no evidence that &quot;ultra-dilute&quot; homeopathic remedies have specific biologic activity. (See <a href=\"#H12915827\" class=\"local\">'Basic theory'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most homeopathic preparations begin with a mineral, plant, or animal substance, which is pulverized and mixed with a water-alcohol solution. It then undergoes serial dilutions and succussions, usually leaving none of the original substance. (See <a href=\"#H12915879\" class=\"local\">'Preparation of remedies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Homeopaths state that they treat the individual rather than the disease. This is the reason that homeopaths choose among numerous different remedies for the same disease. The practicing homeopath, after eliciting a list of symptoms from a patient, determines the remedy by finding the most closely matching symptom group. There is poor inter-rater reliability among experienced homeopaths in selecting remedies. (See <a href=\"#H1042762122\" class=\"local\">'Choosing remedies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The totality of the evidence finds that homeopathic remedies are no more effective than placebos. There is no role of homeopathy for the prevention or treatment of any disease. (See <a href=\"#H12915949\" class=\"local\">'Clinical evidence'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/homeopathy/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Shang A, Huwiler-M&uuml;ntener K, Nartey L, et al.
