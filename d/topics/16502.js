Most cases are idiopathic, and the prognosis depends on the severity of the hearing loss.</p><p>The diagnosis and treatment of SSNHL are discussed here. The evaluation of non-acute hearing loss and the differential diagnosis of hearing loss are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-hearing-loss-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of hearing loss in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-hearing-loss-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of hearing loss in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The exact incidence of sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is uncertain. Since recovery is often spontaneous, many affected people likely never seek medical attention. Estimates of incidence typically range from 2 to 20 per 100,000 people per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. SSNHL can occur at any age but most commonly affects patients 43 to 53 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Risk factors for idiopathic SSNHL are uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Similar numbers of men and women are affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Compared with patients with unilateral SSNHL, those with bilateral SSNHL are more likely to be older, to have cardiovascular disease, and to have a positive antinuclear antibody titer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Some studies have suggested that diet (those low in fresh vegetables), low folate levels, and metabolic syndrome are associated with an increased risk of SSNHL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. There is also some evidence that patients with chronic otitis media may be at higher risk of developing SSNHL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>SSNHL may be a risk factor for stroke. In a study of patients in Taiwan hospitalized for treatment of a first episode of SSNHL, the risk of stroke over a five-year follow-up period was increased compared with patients of similar age and demographics hospitalized for appendicitis (hazard ratio [HR] 1.64, 95% CI 1.31-2.07) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, in a review of the literature, the committee developing 2012 guidelines for the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) found that the relationship between SSNHL and risk of stroke did not meet their threshold for significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. SSHNL has also been associated with an increased risk for myocardial infarction later in life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who have an acute onset of hearing loss, in whom examination reveals sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) with no underlying condition identifiable by history or examination, are considered to have SSNHL.</p><p>The National Institute for Deafness and Communication Disorders (NICDC) specifies the following criteria for the diagnosis of SSNHL: idiopathic hearing loss of at least 30 dB over at least three test frequencies occurring over a 72-hour period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This definition was adopted for the 2012 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) practice guideline for SSNHL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] and is the one most often used in randomized trials. The definition assumes that hearing was either normal or any loss was stable before the onset of new symptoms. Many studies, however, use differing criteria for identifying SSNHL, including loss of 10 to 20 dB in two or three frequencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>] or hearing loss within 12 hours, including hearing loss noted on awakening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology of most cases of sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Postulated causes for idiopathic SSNHL include viral cochleitis, microvascular events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], and autoimmune disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. An association of genes related to prothrombotic states (particularly MTHFR polymorphisms) and increased serum levels of fibrinogen and homocysteine in patients with SSNHL suggests a multifactorial basis for microvascular events as a cause of SSNHL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Herpes simplex type 1 virus (HSV-1) may be a significant etiologic factor in SSNHL, analogous to its possible role in Bell's palsy. Other etiologies of SSNHL are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F78516\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78516 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bells-palsy-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bell's palsy: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis in adults&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) typically report immediate or rapid hearing loss or find that they have lost hearing upon awakening. In a series of 56 patients, 28 had sudden hearing loss, 27 noted hearing loss on awakening, and one had rapidly progressive hearing loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Most patients have unilateral hearing loss, but up to 3 percent of cases may be bilateral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Patients with unilateral SSNHL can occasionally develop SSNHL in the other ear.</p><p>Many patients, however, present with a sensation of a blocked or full ear and do not recognize that they have lost hearing. Because a blocked ear is common, and can be attributed to a number of conditions that are not serious, patients may not seek immediate attention for this symptom, and clinicians may not be sufficiently concerned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>More than 90 percent of patients with unilateral SSNHL report tinnitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/1,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12</a>]. The tinnitus is often difficult to treat and greatly impacts the psychological burden of SSNHL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-diagnosis-of-tinnitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and diagnosis of tinnitus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-tinnitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of tinnitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Vertigo has been reported in 20 to 60 percent of patients with SSNHL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Patients occasionally report ear pain or paresthesias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Physical examination should not reveal signs of otitis media or obstruction in the ear canal and, except for signs related to hearing loss, should be otherwise unremarkable. Evaluation for vertebral artery dissection should be considered in patients with occipital or posterior neck pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>SSNHL may have a profound impact on quality of life, which is further impaired if there is significant associated dizziness <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tinnitus. For patients with unilateral hearing loss, difficulty in localizing sound may increase the risk of accidents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7188815\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who have an acute onset of hearing loss, in whom evaluation reveals sensorineural hearing loss with no underlying condition identifiable by history or examination, are considered to have sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL).</p><p>Patients who complain of sudden hearing loss or awaken with new hearing loss should be evaluated to determine if the hearing deficit is due to a conductive or sensorineural problem. Although both conductive and sensorineural hearing loss require evaluation, there is more urgency to initiate treatment when SSNHL is suspected:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If initial assessment takes place over the telephone, the patient can be told to hum and asked if the sound lateralizes to one side [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Lateralization to the side of hearing loss suggests conductive loss. However, if the sound does not lateralize or lateralizes to the opposite side of hearing loss, then the patient should have an urgent evaluation for SSNHL.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the office, the Weber and Rinne tests can help distinguish between sensorineural and conductive loss (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58032\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58032 \">figure 1</a>). When the Weber test lateralizes, it correctly identifies SSNHL in the affected ear in most patients; however, when the Weber test does not lateralize, SSNHL may be present and further evaluation is required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-hearing-loss-in-adults#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of hearing loss in adults&quot;, section on 'Weber and Rinne tests'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Patients should be asked about a history of trauma, ear pain, ear drainage, fever, focal neurologic symptoms, headache, diplopia, recent eye pain or redness, and prior history of hearing loss. A history of fluctuating hearing loss should suggest another diagnosis, such as Meniere disease, hyperviscosity syndrome, or autoimmune disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meniere-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Meniere disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-waldenstrom-macroglobulinemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cogans-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cogan's syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Physical examination should include otoscopic examination to exclude otitis media, foreign bodies, perforated tympanic membrane, otitis externa, or cholesteatoma. If present, impacted cerumen should be removed and the hearing loss evaluated thereafter. A neurologic examination is necessary to exclude stroke in the territory of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery as a cause of the sudden hearing loss. (See <a href=\"#H7189043\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>All patients with sudden SSNHL should undergo audiometric evaluation and most patients should undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning with gadolinium unless the etiology is absolutely clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Accurate audiometric evaluation is essential both to support the initial diagnosis and to follow changes over time.</p><p>Routine blood tests are not indicated in the evaluation of a patient with SSNHL. Laboratory studies should be based on findings from the history and physical examination that suggest a specific etiology that warrants diagnostic studies. As an example, Lyme titers may be indicated in patients with a history suggesting exposure in an endemic area.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7189167\"><span class=\"h2\">MRI scanning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with suspected SSNHL should be imaged with contrast MRI whenever possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Computed tomography (CT) scan does not provide sufficient resolution for detecting tumors of the cerebellopontine angle or small brainstem infarctions and should be used only in patients who cannot undergo MR scanning. </p><p>Most patients with SSNHL likely have a viral, autoimmune, or microvascular etiology, and these conditions will not be identifiable by MRI. However, other causes of unilateral hearing loss, such as acoustic neuroma, perilymphatic fistula, Meniere disease, vascular insufficiency, multiple sclerosis, or other conditions involving the central nervous system may only be discovered on MRI scan.</p><p>In a series of 82 patients who were seen at a tertiary referral center with SSNHL, MRI revealed the etiology of hearing loss in six patients (four with acoustic neuroma; one with changes in the pons; one with internal carotid artery occlusion), and a possible etiology of SSNHL was found in six additional patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In another series of 556 patients, 17 patients (3 percent) had a retrocochlear tumor (schwannoma, neurofibroma, or undifferentiated carcinoma) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Thirty of the 556 patients had mid-frequency hearing loss, and 10 of those patients (33 percent) had a retrocochlear tumor. Other studies report the rate of vestibular schwannomas to range from 2.7 to 10.2 percent in patients presenting with sensorineural hearing loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Alternatives to MRI for the diagnosis of a vestibular schwannoma are an auditory brainstem response or audiometric follow-up, but they are not as sensitive as an MRI and would not identify other potential causes of hearing loss. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma)&quot;, section on 'Audiometry'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma)&quot;, section on 'Imaging'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7189043\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are multiple causes of conductive and sensorineural hearing loss (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53903\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53903 \">table 2</a>). Typically, sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is distinguished from other causes of sensorineural hearing loss because most other etiologies result in bilateral hearing loss, and sudden onset is infrequent.</p><p>The most common cause of unilateral sudden hearing loss that should be distinguished from SSNHL is an acute stroke, typically due to occlusion of the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA), which feeds the internal auditory artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. AICA occlusion may manifest as ipsilateral Horner syndrome, diplopia, nystagmus, facial weakness, limb clumsiness, ataxia, and contralateral loss of pain or temperature sensation. Less frequent neurologic causes of sensorineural hearing loss include multiple sclerosis, meningitis, vestibular schwannomas, and migrainous infarction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-diagnosis-of-stroke-subtypes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical diagnosis of stroke subtypes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vestibular-schwannoma-acoustic-neuroma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=headache-migraine-and-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Headache, migraine, and stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Strong evidence for the efficacy of any treatment option for patients with sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) is not available. Glucocorticoids are considered first-line therapy for SSNHL and may be administered systemically (generally orally) or locally via intratympanic installation. Intratympanic glucocorticoids are often reserved for use when hearing does not improve after a trial of systemic therapy. Intratympanic glucocorticoids can also be used as initial therapy in patients in whom high-dose systemic glucocorticoids should be avoided, such as in patients with diabetes. In addition to glucocorticoids, we suggest treatment with an antiviral agent for treatment of possible herpes simplex type 1 virus (HSV-1) infection, although others believe such treatment is not indicated. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Antiviral agents'</a> below.)</p><p>Management strategies vary, reflecting the uncertainty of treatment efficacy and the significant rate of spontaneous recovery. One survey found that glucocorticoids were used more often by otolaryngologists than general practitioners who treat patients with SSNHL (98 and 73 percent, respectively) and used in higher doses by specialists (at least 60 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Additionally, approximately 50 percent of otolaryngologists treated patients with antiviral therapy, compared with 16 percent of generalists.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While oral glucocorticoids have been considered standard therapy for SSNHL, the benefit of these drugs is unclear. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses conclude that the effectiveness of glucocorticoids remains unproven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. These reviews identified only three randomized studies of sufficient quality for analysis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized trial from 1980 compared placebo with glucocorticoid treatment in 67 patients with SSNHL within 10 days of hearing loss at two centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The trial demonstrated some benefit from glucocorticoid treatment. More patients treated with glucocorticoids recovered hearing (61 versus 32 percent, relative risk [RR] 1.30, 95% CI 0.91-1.86). Patients with mild hearing loss recovered hearing, regardless of treatment group. Glucocorticoid therapy did not appear to improve rates of recovery compared with placebo in 23 patients with profound hearing loss (18 versus 17 percent). A subgroup analysis of patients with moderate hearing loss found the recovery rate for the glucocorticoid group was 78 percent, compared with 38 percent for the placebo group (RR 1.74, 95% CI 1.19-2.55).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although issues related to randomization, concealment, and differing treatment protocols call into question the significance of these findings, the study remains the best effort at evaluating the efficacy of glucocorticoids for SSNHL.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized trial from 2001, evaluating the effectiveness of glucocorticoids or carbogen inhalation therapy in 41 patients with SSNHL found no difference in hearing level at six different frequencies between the glucocorticoid- and placebo-treated patients; improvement was found in 60 and 63 percent at early follow-up (RR 0.94) and 80 and 81 percent at late follow-up (RR 0.98) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Because a relatively small number of patients were randomly assigned to four treatment groups, the groups may have been too small to detect statistically significant differences in outcome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A third randomized trial from 2012 compared placebo with a tapering regimen of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> in 93 patients seeking care within one week of the onset of unilateral SSNHL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. There was no difference in hearing improvement between the two groups.</p><p/><p>A retrospective review of audiometry outcome and word recognition scores, comparing patients treated with glucocorticoids to those who declined treatment, found a significant improvement in the treated group who initially had severe to profound loss; no difference was seen when milder cases were included in the analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Another retrospective review found patients who were treated within two weeks of symptoms with at least 60 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> daily did better than patients who received lower doses of glucocorticoid or who were treated later in their course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In a prospective randomized study, high-dose pulse therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> (300 mg daily for three days) was not more effective than prednisone 70 mg on day 1 with tapered dose over seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>With recognition of the equivocal efficacy of treatment, guidelines from the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) suggest that patients with SSNHL be offered treatment with oral glucocorticoids, with the greatest likelihood of some response if started within two weeks of the onset of hearing loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Patients should be advised of the risks and benefits of glucocorticoid treatment. The recommended dose for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> is 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> (to 60 mg maximum) given as a single dose for 10 to 14 days.

Guidelines from the AAO-HNS suggest that the choice or oral or IT glucocorticoids as initial therapy be based upon considerations such as cost and side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]; IT glucocorticoids are a reasonable alternative for patient with diabetes and others who may not tolerate high-dose systemic glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Simultaneous administration of IT and oral glucocorticoids as initial treatment may not offer benefit beyond sequential treatment. In a randomized trial of 88 patients with SSNHL, there was no difference in hearing recovery between those assigned to simultaneous IT and oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> versus oral dexamethasone followed by IT dexamethasone for patients who did not improve with initial therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Fifteen of 44 patients in the latter treatment arm avoided IT treatment. Another randomized trial found that hearing outcomes at one month were better for patients treated with combination oral and IT steroid, compared with oral steroid alone, but patients were not offered &quot;rescue&quot; IT steroids in this trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Antiviral agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although HSV-1 may be an important etiology for SSNHL, randomized trials have found no superiority of treatment with antiviral medication plus glucocorticoids compared with glucocorticoids alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/43-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-46</a>]. However, these studies were small and associated with some flaws and, therefore, definitive conclusions cannot be made.</p><p>Guidelines from the AAO-HNS suggest not treating with antivirals, citing the lack of evidence for efficacy and some risk of medication side effects (nausea, vomiting, dizziness) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A systematic analysis of randomized trials evaluating antiviral agents for SSNHL noted no difference in response rates for groups that used antivirals or not, but also no difference in serious adverse effects between groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The review concluded that larger trials, with a uniform definition of SSNHL, are needed to draw definitive conclusions on the effectiveness of antivirals for this condition. In the absence of larger trials of antivirals, we typically treat SSNHL of unknown origin with a 7- to 10-day course of an anti-HSV antiviral such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valacyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valacyclovir</a> 1 g three times daily or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=famciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">famciclovir</a> 500 mg three times daily, in addition to high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3756759190\"><span class=\"h2\">Combination therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Therapy combining systemic steroids and intratympanic glucocorticoids may be used in some patients.

Approximately two-thirds of patients with idiopathic SSNHL will experience recovery, although this recovery is often not complete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/1,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12</a>].</p><p>The prognosis for low-frequency hearing loss may be better than for high-frequency hearing loss. As an example, in a study of patients with either low- or high-frequency hearing loss, those with low-frequency hearing loss were more likely to have complete recovery (56 versus 23 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>By contrast, the prognosis is poor in patients with profound hearing loss across all frequencies. In a study of 545 such patients, all of whom received oral glucocorticoids, complete recovery occurred in 3.6 percent (5.2 and 2.6 percent with and without salvage intratympanic [IT] glucocorticoids, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-sensorineural-hearing-loss/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].

The hearing loss may occur suddenly, may be found on awakening, or may be rapidly progressive over hours (or perhaps over two to three days). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are many etiologies for SSNHL (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F78516\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78516 \">table 1</a>); however, for many cases, a definite cause is not known. Most of these cases are felt to be due to viral cochleitis, a microvascular event, or an autoimmune process. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spontaneous improvement is common for SSNHL, and studies are contradictory on the effectiveness of glucocorticoid therapy. We suggest initial treatment with a 10- to 14-day course of high-dose glucocorticoids (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, 60 per day) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Intratympanic (IT) glucocorticoids may be used as initial therapy for patients intolerant to high-dose steroids. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Oral glucocorticoids'</a> above and <a href=\"#H78218348\" class=\"local\">'Intratympanic glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Randomized trials have not demonstrated effectiveness for the addition of antiviral therapy to glucocorticoid protocols. However, a subset of patients with SSNHL may have herpes simplex type 1 virus (HSV-1) infection and could benefit from antiviral drugs. In weighing the potential benefits of antiviral treatment for this unidentifiable subset (despite lack of effectiveness evidence from controlled trials) against the safety and minimal toxicity of antiviral therapy, we suggest treatment for 7 to 10 days with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valacyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valacyclovir</a> 1 g three times daily or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=famciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">famciclovir</a> 500 mg three times daily (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
