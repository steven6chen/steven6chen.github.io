The popularity of comanagement has grown in parallel with the hospitalist movement. Between 2001 and 2006, the comanagement of surgical patients by hospitalists increased by over 11 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-comanagement/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This increase is due to several factors, including an increasing number of patients with advance aged or serious medical disease undergoing surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-comanagement/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of the principles of surgical comanagement. The principles of traditional medical consultation are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-principles-of-medical-consultation-and-perioperative-medicine\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the principles of medical consultation and perioperative medicine&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H265511083\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medical comanagement of surgical patients can take a variety of forms. Often, the surgeon remains the attending of record, while the comanaging physician is given wide latitude to manage the perioperative care of surgical patients. Alternatively, these roles are reversed, and the surgical patient is admitted to the comanaging physician, who assumes primary responsibility for care. In this case, the surgeon is often only responsible for managing issues related to the surgical diagnosis and procedure. Regardless of the specific arrangement, comanagement has features that distinguishes it from traditional medical consultation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F107524\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107524 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H265511090\"><span class=\"h2\">Negotiated relationship</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In traditional medical consultation, the role of the consultant is either defined at the time the consultation is requested or based upon presumed mutual understanding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-comanagement/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Comanagement relationships are far more formal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-comanagement/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Protocols and expectations are negotiated between the primary and comanaging physician and often delineated in a written comanagement agreement prior to initiating patient care. They involve not only the individual surgeon and comanaging physician but the entire surgical and hospital medicine groups as well as other potential partners, such as hospital administrators.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H265511097\"><span class=\"h2\">Selection of patients and reasons for referral</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With traditional consultation, the surgeon retains sole authority and responsibility for identifying patients who would benefit from evaluation by the consultant. The surgeon also determines the scope of the consultant's involvement. Consultation etiquette constrains the ability of the consultant to address issues beyond those specified by the referring provider [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-comanagement/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-principles-of-medical-consultation-and-perioperative-medicine#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the principles of medical consultation and perioperative medicine&quot;, section on 'Performing the consultation'</a>.)</p><p>Comanagement relationships usually give the comanaging physician greater leeway in selecting patients and determining which problems to address. Many comanagement agreements list clinical criteria that automatically lead to the comanaging physician's involvement, without requiring a formal consult request from the surgeon. The comanagement agreement may also describe aspects of perioperative care that will be the responsibility of the comanaging physician, who is then free to address any issues within those domains.</p><p>Ideal patient selection criteria for comanagement are not well defined but should try to identify patients at higher risk for perioperative medical complications. Commonly utilized criteria may include diagnoses (eg, hip fracture), demographic features (eg, advanced age), or medical comorbidity (eg, dysfunction of specific organ systems).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H265511104\"><span class=\"h2\">Broad scope of practice</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies performed on traditional medical consultation services have found that up to one-half of all recommendations are ignored by the requesting physician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-comanagement/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Compliance to consultant orders may be better in nonteaching hospitals, where consultants often have some order writing privileges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-comanagement/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Comanagement relationships provide the comanaging physician with a very broad scope of practice, allowing them to write almost any order, call in additional consultants, and otherwise manage patients as necessary. The comanagement agreement may indicate restrictions on this scope of practice. For example, the comanaging physician might not be permitted to order antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants without the surgeon's approval, due to the risk of surgical site hemorrhage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H265511111\"><span class=\"h2\">Communication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In traditional medical consultation, communication is routed through the referring surgeon. Only the surgeon may request the consultant's assistance. Consultation etiquette discourages the consultant from conveying impressions and recommendations to the patient. Rather, this should be relayed only to the surgeon, who determines what should be communicated to the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-comanagement/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In contrast, lines of communication are much more complex and fluid with comanagement. The comanaging physician can expect to be contacted by any care provider who has concerns about the patient. The comanaging physician is generally free to communicate directly with the patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-principles-of-medical-consultation-and-perioperative-medicine#H200702388\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the principles of medical consultation and perioperative medicine&quot;, section on 'Discussion with the patient'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H265511125\"><span class=\"h1\">BENEFITS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite its growing popularity, comanagement has not been proven to universally improve outcomes. Studies comparing comanagement with traditional consultation have looked at its impact in three areas: clinical outcomes, satisfaction with care, and efficiency of care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H265511132\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is not clear what effect comanagement has on patient outcomes. In the only randomized trial of a comanagement model, older adult patients with significant medical disease undergoing elective arthroplasty were assigned to care by a traditional medicine consultation service or a hospitalist-led comanagement service [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-comanagement/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Comanaged patients were more likely (62 versus 50 percent) to be discharged without a complication. This difference was driven by a reduction in minor complications, such as electrolyte abnormality, fever, or urinary tract infection. The care model did not affect the incidence of more serious complications, such as myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, or pneumonia.</p><p>Some observational studies have also found that comanagement improves patient outcomes, including decreasing mortality and complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-comanagement/abstract/10-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-15</a>]. A systematic review including 21 studies of shared care between orthopedic surgeons and geriatricians found that, compared with the traditional consultant model, an integrated care model (where the orthopedic surgeon and geriatrician manage patients together) had a lower mortality rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-comanagement/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Another study at one institution including patients admitted to either an orthopedic surgery or neurosurgical service found that, compared with the traditional consultant model, patients who were comanaged had fewer medical complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-comanagement/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>However, other observational studies have not found that comanagement improves patient outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-comanagement/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. Hip fracture patients comanaged by hospitalists were compared with a historical control group that received traditional medical consultation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-comanagement/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Short-term and long-term mortality and 30-day readmission rates did not differ between these cohorts. Complication rates were also unchanged, except for the incidence of delirium, which was actually higher in the comanaged cohort. This finding may reflect more robust detection and reporting of delirium in comanaged patients, rather than an actual effect on its true incidence. In another study using a historical control, mortality and readmission rates also failed to improve after implementation of a comanagement service for neurosurgical patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-comanagement/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H265511139\"><span class=\"h2\">Satisfaction</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Provider</strong> &ndash; Surgeons and nurses are consistently more satisfied with comanagement than consultation. In one trial, 90 percent of surgeons and nurses felt that comanagement improved care of orthopedic surgery patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-comanagement/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Similarly, over 90 percent of surgeons and nurses caring for neurosurgical patients felt that hospitalist comanagement improved patient care and made it easier for them to provide care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-comanagement/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. This study also found a marked increase in the perception that unstable patients were promptly identified and treated, medical problems were addressed after discharge, and communication was optimal. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patient</strong> &ndash; Studies of comanagement have not found any meaningful impact in patient satisfaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-comanagement/abstract/9,11,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11,18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H265511146\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficiency of care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Comanagement by hospitalists tends to improve efficiency of care, as measured by length of stay and hospital costs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-comanagement/abstract/10,11,13-16,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,13-16,18</a>]. In hip fracture patients, comanagement was associated with significantly decreased time between admission and surgery and shorter observed length of stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-comanagement/abstract/13,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16</a>]. In neurosurgical patients, comanagement was associated with a hospital cost savings of over $1400 per admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-comanagement/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H265511153\"><span class=\"h1\">RISKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Shared responsibility can lead to fragmented care and disengagement of the surgeon from direct perioperative care. A poorly-negotiated agreement that devalues the comanaging physician's role can also lead to career dissatisfaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-comanagement/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H265511160\"><span class=\"h2\">Fragmented care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Comanagement entails dividing care responsibilities between two providers. While some tasks (such as caring for the wound) are obviously the purview of the surgeon, and others (such as evaluation of electrolyte derangements) will fall to the comanaging physician, there are large areas of potential overlap. Without coordination of efforts, tasks can be omitted or duplicated. For example, a surgeon and comanaging physician may both fail to order a red blood cell transfusion for a severely anemic patient, as each assumed it was the other provider's responsibility. Furthermore, the actions of one provider may conflict with that of their counterpart, such as when one physician orders intravenous fluids while the other orders diuretic therapy.</p><p>Fragmented care also complicates the lines of communication. Nurses or other providers caring for comanaged patients may be uncertain as to whether to contact the surgeon or comanaging physician with questions or concerns. As a result, important information is delayed or lost. Patients may also be confused by the comanagement arrangement and have difficulty directing their questions appropriately.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H265511167\"><span class=\"h2\">Disengagement of the surgeon</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of a comanaging physician frees up the surgeon to spend more time in the operating room or clinic. This can have the unintended consequence of untethering the surgeon from responsibilities of managing the perioperative care of their patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-comanagement/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Disengagement of the surgeon can leave the comanaging physician to care for problems beyond their training and experience.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H265511174\"><span class=\"h2\">Provider dissatisfaction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While studies have found that surgeons prefer medical comanagement to consultation, less is known about the comanaging physician satisfaction with this model. Career satisfaction will suffer if much of the work assigned to the comanaging physician is noncognitive or mundane. Comanaging stable, low-risk patients may also be perceived as unrewarding. Comanagement can lead to an unequal relationship, typically with the comanaging physician as the lesser partner. This may be exacerbated by arrangements that place the comanaging physician under the supervision of the surgeon. Excessive workloads may also impair satisfaction with comanagement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H265511181\"><span class=\"h1\">KEYS TO SUCCESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Comanagement is far more complicated than traditional medical consultation and requires considerable advanced planning. The Society for Hospital Medicine (SHM) has developed <a href=\"http://www.hospitalmedicine.org/Web/Practice_Management/Co-Management/program_building_guide.aspx&amp;token=kBQ6m89Mmof6UieYE52SsgAdsv38hzddgBtdNTkJKZnn9CUGYlnyQgGQHKy0h0CaP7fJ46wMP82wDyNroR8MzKuxfrpY5umvc2mkLK199P+63GOKOBmwFIkCgNmuwXXS&amp;TOPIC_ID=16284\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">a guide</a> for building a comanagement program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-comanagement/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. While actual implementation of comanagement will vary according to the needs and capabilities of the hospital medicine group and surgical service at each hospital, the SHM guide lists five basic steps to forging a successful comanagement service:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identify obstacles and challenges</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clarify roles and responsibilities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identify champions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Address financial issues</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measure performance</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3274803585\"><span class=\"h2\">Identify obstacles and challenges</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before embarking on comanagement, consideration should be given to potential obstacles, challenges, and risks to the service. When contemplating the creation of a comanagement relationship, planners should ask:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Who are the key stakeholders (eg, surgeons, comanaging <span class=\"nowrap\">physician/hospitalists,</span> hospital administrators, other specialists, nonphysician providers)?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the goals of comanagement?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the risk to patients and providers if the service is unsuccessful?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there unrealistic assumptions about the effect of comanagement?</p><p/><p>SHM has developed a <a href=\"http://www.hospitalmedicine.org/Web/Practice_Management/Co-Management/AppendixA_CoManagement.aspx&amp;token=IzqVlEotkHULzOWY/ZI2uhaMRAwchDnGSxz0udSghBxsM23DOcLMZ3AA0K6W7benS50Wyd3M/TS8qBr7/pUorw4k3dc7dNti6aw4jeYNRxZCg411VcBqSMw/OkC5cv0Q&amp;TOPIC_ID=16284\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">checklist</a> to provide a framework for identifying obstacles and challenges.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H265511202\"><span class=\"h2\">Clarify roles and responsibilities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the complexity of comanagement arrangements, the specific roles and responsibilities of the surgeons and comanaging physician must be delineated in the comanagement agreement. This helps prevent errors that can arise from fragmented care. <a href=\"http://www.hospitalmedicine.org/Web/Practice_Management/Co-Management/AppendixB_CoManagement.aspx&amp;token=I1YTEEmdaFAswgGrZ2n+sre+R6Y7PeCzqjY9BWGFq7mjQ/YtKOjCXyCJiXpaI691ClZBD9KK2TMh3U3X37MinDaRQ2QYx2K1rS2MZL1QMtZ4HfwmoSaYigBY75+BPpTv&amp;TOPIC_ID=16284\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Common questions</a> to address are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How will patients be selected for comanagement?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Who will be the attending of record for comanaged patients?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Which problems and complications will the comanaging physician versus the surgeon address?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is the role of each party in admitting patients and discharge planning?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What restrictions will be placed on the comanaging physician's scope of practice?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the protocols for communication? (eg, How should calls from nurses be directed? When is direct communication between the surgeon and comanaging physician required? How will disagreements be resolved?)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H740380885\"><span class=\"h2\">Identify champions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both the surgical and medical groups should identify an individual with strong leadership and interpersonal skills who is committed to the success of the service. The champions will represent their group when negotiating the comanagement agreement but should also be willing to compromise and act as voice of moderation. They should meet regularly after implementation to evaluate and improve the service.</p><p>The champions must advocate for the service to their colleagues, as well as to the hospital, which may be asked to provide financial or logistical support. The champion must understand the needs and capabilities of their group. For instance, the surgical group champion should recognize what problems are beyond the surgeons' capabilities to manage, and the comanaging physician medicine group champion should know how many patients a comanaging physician can comanage at once.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H80034822\"><span class=\"h2\">Address financial issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vast majority of hospital medicine programs cannot meet their financial obligations without support, which typically comes from the hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-comanagement/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Before agreeing to create a comanagement service, stakeholders should estimate the revenue that the combined medical-surgical comanagement service will generate and agree on how any deficit will be funded.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H265511209\"><span class=\"h2\">Measure performance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to tracking census data and case mix, the service champions should determine if comanagement has improved clinical outcomes, satisfaction, and efficiency of care.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Clinical outcomes</strong> &ndash; Commonly measured clinical outcome include: rates of mortality, surgical and medical complications, unplanned transfer to an intensive care unit, and 30-day readmission. In addition, it is helpful to measure process outcomes that reflect quality of care. Examples include rates of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis, removal of urinary catheters, as well as core measures from organizations dedicated to advancing hospital quality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measuring-quality-in-hospitals-in-the-united-states#H12467922\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measuring quality in hospitals in the United States&quot;, section on 'Currently reported process measures of hospital quality'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Satisfaction</strong> &ndash; Satisfaction with comanagement should be assessed in patients, surgeons, hospitalists, nurses and other stakeholders. Patient satisfaction is usually evaluated using standard survey, such as those developed by Press Ganey or the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-comanagement/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Providers can be surveyed on satisfaction with issues such as:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Quality and promptness of communication</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Availability of the surgeon or hospitalist to address complications</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Quality of discharge planning</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Impact of comanagement on the provider's ability to deliver care</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Overall quality of medical care</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Efficiency</strong> &ndash; Efficiency of care is of particular concern to the hospital. Typical measurements include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Overall length of stay, as well as time from admission-to-surgery, and from surgery-to-discharge</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Direct hospital costs per admission</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Surgery cancellation rates</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H265511223\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Comanagement is a model that allows the generalist (typically a hospitalist) to share the responsibility, authority, and accountability for the care of surgical patients.

Comanagement gives the comanaging physician a broad scope of practice, often allowing them to select patients and problems to manage and to write most orders without the surgeon's consent.
