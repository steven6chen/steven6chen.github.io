In some fetuses, this space is enlarged due to a cystic hygroma or mesenchymal edema (called increased nuchal translucency). These fetuses are at increased risk for structural abnormalities and aneuploidy, particularly Down syndrome.</p><p>The diagnosis, clinical significance, and management of pregnancies complicated by a cystic hygroma or increased nuchal translucency will be reviewed here. Additional first-trimester markers and second-trimester ultrasound markers of aneuploidy are reviewed separately.

This hypoechoic space is presumed to represent mesenchymal edema and is often associated with distended jugular lymphatics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-hygroma-and-increased-nuchal-translucency/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. A small but measurable amount of nuchal fluid can be identified in virtually all fetuses between the 10<sup>th</sup> and 14<sup>th</sup> week of gestation and is considered a normal finding if below a defined threshold (see <a href=\"#H1769499354\" class=\"local\">'Prenatal diagnosis'</a> below). Above this threshold, the fetus is considered to have increased nuchal translucency.</p><p>The pathogenesis of nuchal edema is unknown, but is probably multifactorial and differs depending on the underlying fetal disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-hygroma-and-increased-nuchal-translucency/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. For example, in trisomy 21 the collagen content of the dermis is abnormal; its hydrophilic properties may lead to the accumulation of subcutaneous fluid. In Turner syndrome, lymphatic dysplasia may lead to increased nuchal fluid, or narrowing of the aortic isthmus and widening of the ascending aorta may lead to overperfusion of the head and neck, thus contributing to the development of subcutaneous edema. In fetuses with abnormal nuchal lymphatic development, distension of the jugular venous sacs, accumulation of fluid in the nuchal region, and retrograde increases in venous pressure may occur. In fetuses with congenital heart disease, mutations in genes encoding for endothelium and involved in both cardiac and lymphatic development may contribute to increases in nuchal fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-hygroma-and-increased-nuchal-translucency/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2619402985\"><span class=\"h2\">Prenatal screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nuchal translucency is measured as part of first trimester and integrated screening tests for Down syndrome.

The residual risk of a significant chromosomal abnormality in these patients is low and anatomic abnormalities that may be associated with increased nuchal translucency are optimally detected at 18 to 22 weeks. Patients choosing cell-free DNA testing who are subsequently incidentally found to have an increased nuchal translucency should be referred for genetic counseling to discuss prognostic implications and the consideration of further genetic testing, and for fetal echocardiography to screen for congenital heart disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal screening for common aneuploidies using cell-free DNA&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Assessment of nuchal translucency before primary cell-free DNA screening is also not recommended as a routine procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-hygroma-and-increased-nuchal-translucency/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, it can help some women, especially those at higher risk for aneuploidy, decide between having a noninvasive screening test (if nuchal translucency is normal) or an invasive procedure and diagnostic procedure with microarray (if nuchal translucency is increased, since there is an increased risk of aneuploidy in this setting). In high-risk women (defined as increased nuchal translucency with or without biochemistry, structural anomalies, advanced maternal <span class=\"nowrap\">age/anxiety,</span> or family history) who choose to undergo cell-free DNA screening, the residual risk of a significant chromosomal abnormality is 2.5 percent in those who screen-negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-hygroma-and-increased-nuchal-translucency/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. These abnormalities include <span class=\"nowrap\">microdeletions/microduplications</span> and RASopathies (eg, Noonan syndrome). The residual risk can be reduced to 1 percent if cell-free DNA screening is performed when nuchal translucency is &lt;3 mm and chorionic villous sampling is performed when nuchal translucency is &ge;3 cm, but this approach also increases the frequency of invasive testing from 2 percent to 22 percent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1769499354\"><span class=\"h2\">Prenatal diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prenatal diagnosis of increased nuchal translucency is based on ultrasound measurement of the nuchal fluid space when the crown-rump length is 36 to 84 mm, which corresponds to approximately 10 to 14 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-hygroma-and-increased-nuchal-translucency/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The optimal time to assess the nuchal translucency is at 11 weeks of gestation.</p><p>The most commonly used thresholds for diagnosis of increased nuchal translucency are the 95<sup>th</sup> and 99<sup>th</sup> percentiles for gestational age (nuchal translucency normally increases with gestational age). We use the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile. Calculators are available online that enable clinicians to enter the crown-rump length and nuchal translucency measurement to obtain the nuchal translucency percentile (one such calculator is available at <a href=\"http://www.perinatology.com/calculators/Crown+Rump+and+Nuchal+Translucency.htm&amp;token=Y1NjOdV+BYVBY0B59+n1y6srZFyZvhPtRKDw5XW4yYhSbvjgvBRPXTt1JFt3QHeO4H//Z5GhWXwn7AwZ2cWNeI8WAc9xXYJh+KAbyqu/AYfCL/YreiUpF2lngZ5xWPiD&amp;TOPIC_ID=435\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">perinatology.com</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1155883835\"><span class=\"h3\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The widest area of the nuchal fluid space is measured from its inner-to-inner borders in the midsagittal plane.

In two large multicenter studies of first-trimester Down syndrome screening, accurate nuchal translucency measurement required stringent training, formalized evaluation of sonographers' competence, and continuing external quality control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-hygroma-and-increased-nuchal-translucency/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. In the latter trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-hygroma-and-increased-nuchal-translucency/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], adequate nuchal translucency images could not be obtained in 6 percent of cases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetal position and maternal body habitus can make accurate measurement difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-hygroma-and-increased-nuchal-translucency/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition, nuchal translucency measurements vary from week to week, and abnormal nuchal measurements can quickly revert to normal, even if the fetus is abnormal.

Increased nuchal translucency may also be associated with developmental and genetic syndromes and, in twins, twin-twin transfusion syndrome. The magnitude of increased nuchal translucency is an important prognostic factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-hygroma-and-increased-nuchal-translucency/abstract/13-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-19</a>]. In one study, for example, first-trimester nuchal translucency 3.5 to 4.4 mm was associated with a normal outcome in 70 percent of fetuses, whereas nuchal translucency 5.5 to 6.4 mm was associated with a normal outcome in only 30 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-hygroma-and-increased-nuchal-translucency/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3831777323\"><span class=\"h3\">Aneuploidy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nuchal translucency is measured primarily as one component of the first-trimester combined screening test for trisomy 21 (Down syndrome). The risk of Down syndrome is calculated from an equation that takes into account nuchal translucency thickness, maternal biochemical marker levels, and maternal age. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=first-trimester-combined-test-and-integrated-tests-for-screening-for-down-syndrome-and-trisomy-18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;First-trimester combined test and integrated tests for screening for Down syndrome and trisomy 18&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Trisomy 21 is the most common aneuploidy associated with increased nuchal translucency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-hygroma-and-increased-nuchal-translucency/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>]. However, trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome), trisomy 18 (Edward syndrome), monosomy X (Turner syndrome), and triploidy are also found with increased frequency among fetuses with increased nuchal translucency.</p><p>The likelihood of aneuploidy increases with increasing nuchal translucency above the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile. For example, the frequency of aneuploidy at a nuchal translucency between the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile (approximately 3 mm) and 3.4 mm, 3.5 to 4.4 mm, 5.5 to 6.4 mm, and &ge;8.5 mm was 7, 20, 50, and 75 percent, respectively, in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-hygroma-and-increased-nuchal-translucency/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In this study, most fetuses with trisomy 21 had a nuchal thickness less than 4.5 mm, and most fetuses with trisomy 13, trisomy 18, and Turner syndrome had nuchal thickness &ge;4.5 mm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H504869822\"><span class=\"h3\">Structural abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The overall frequency of structural anomalies is 4 to 10 percent in euploid fetuses with increased nuchal translucency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-hygroma-and-increased-nuchal-translucency/abstract/13,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4238495480\"><span class=\"h4\">Congenital heart disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiac defects are the most common malformation associated with increased nuchal translucency, and septal defects are the most common cardiac abnormality.

Depending upon the cut-off used (95<sup>th</sup> versus 99<sup>th</sup> percentile), the overall risk of a cardiac defect in an euploid fetus with increased nuchal translucency ranges from approximately 2 to 6 percent, which is severalfold higher than the 0.6 percent baseline risk of moderate and severe forms of congenital heart disease in the general obstetrical population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-hygroma-and-increased-nuchal-translucency/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].
