These organisms are endemic to certain arid regions of the western hemisphere. Infection is virtually always acquired by inhalation, and primary infection frequently goes unrecognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-and-treatment-of-extrapulmonary-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Dissemination of infection beyond the lungs can occur, but it is difficult to estimate the incidence of overt disseminated disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-coccidioidal-infection#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary coccidioidal infection&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-coccidioidal-infection#H1073167939\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary coccidioidal infection&quot;, section on 'Microbiology'</a>.)</p><p>The manifestations and treatment of extrapulmonary coccidioidomycosis other than involvement of the central nervous system will be reviewed here. Primary infection, laboratory diagnosis, pulmonary sequelae, coccidioidal meningitis, and infection in immunocompromised hosts are discussed separately.

Past estimates of this risk vary from approximately 4.7 percent of recognized infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-and-treatment-of-extrapulmonary-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] to 0.2 percent of all respiratory exposures to <em>Coccidioides</em> spp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-and-treatment-of-extrapulmonary-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This substantial range in estimates is probably due to the under-recognition of mild infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-and-treatment-of-extrapulmonary-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Patient groups at risk for extrapulmonary infection include those who are of African or Filipino ancestry and those who are immunosuppressed.</p><p>The Arizona Department of Health Services sought to review medical charts of every 10th person newly reported with coccidioidomycosis from January 2007 to February 2008 and were 65.7 percent successful for a total of 324 cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-and-treatment-of-extrapulmonary-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Of these, 26 (8.0 percent) had clinical or laboratory evidence of infection beyond the lungs. If this sample was representative of all reported infections that year (approximately 5000), then, by extrapolation, there were a total of 400 newly diagnosed disseminated infections in Arizona.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When disseminated infection occurs, it usually becomes evident within weeks after the initial exposure. Thus, it is common for dissemination to be clinically apparent at the time infection is first diagnosed. In patients who do not receive treatment for early coccidioidal infections, new onset of disseminated disease after two years is very uncommon in the absence of immunosuppression. However, in studies of patients who have received early antifungal treatment, there are reports of delayed recognition of dissemination until up to two years after treatment is stopped [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-and-treatment-of-extrapulmonary-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In the author's practice, a patient's vertebral coccidioidal osteomyelitis first became evident seven years after a brief course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> was given for early coccidioidal pneumonia.</p><p>Extrapulmonary dissemination is usually the result of hematogenous spread of the organism. It is possible that some infections occur by <em>Coccidioides</em> spp gaining access to the bloodstream directly from venous drainage of the lungs. However, hilar adenopathy is a frequent feature of coccidioidal pneumonia, and progression of infection to paratracheal and even supraclavicular lymph nodes prior to the development of extrapulmonary lesions is well documented. The common involvement of lymph nodes suggests that some, if not most, disseminated infections result from lymphatic drainage, eventually to the common lymphatic duct into the inferior vena cava and from there to the rest of the body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extrapulmonary lesions typically become evident in a subacute or chronic fashion. The timing and nature of the symptoms may depend upon the exact location and number of individual lesions. Symptoms usually reflect the site of infection and are often indistinguishable from infection of these organs due to other pathogens, cancer, or degenerative processes. Because of the indolent nature of the infection and lack of specificity of symptoms including pain, the diagnosis of extrapulmonary coccidioidomycosis is frequently delayed by weeks or even months. This is especially true if the initial pulmonary infection has not yet been recognized.</p><p>The most common sites of disseminated lesions are [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-and-treatment-of-extrapulmonary-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin or subcutaneous soft tissue &ndash; Skin or subcutaneous soft tissue involvement includes cutaneous granulomatous lesions, subcutaneous soft tissue abscesses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F110855\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef110855 \">picture 1</a>), and supraclavicular adenopathy).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skeleton </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Joint involvement &ndash; Disseminated coccidioidomycosis frequently involves only a single joint (eg, knee, wrist, or ankle). Monoarticular infection of the knee is the most common, with a presentation that mimics a degenerative or traumatically injured joint.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Vertebral infection &ndash; For patients with vertebral infection, lesions may be single or multiple, occasionally involving the sacrum and ileum. Radionuclide bone scans are useful to identify possible areas of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-and-treatment-of-extrapulmonary-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with gadolinium enhancement has been especially useful in defining the extent of individual lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-and-treatment-of-extrapulmonary-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">In some cases when multiple vertebral lesions are present, there may be no other identified lesions of disseminated infection. This suggests either a predilection for vertebral osteomyelitis in certain patients, a tropism for the spine among certain strains of <em>C. immitis</em>, or spread to the vertebrae through venous channels of Batson's plexus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Meninges of the brain and spinal cord &ndash; Of all sites of dissemination, meningitis is the most uniformly serious and poses special problems in management that are addressed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coccidioidal-meningitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coccidioidal meningitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Other sites of dissemination that occur to a lesser degree include endocrine glands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-and-treatment-of-extrapulmonary-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>], the eye [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-and-treatment-of-extrapulmonary-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>], the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-and-treatment-of-extrapulmonary-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], the kidneys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-and-treatment-of-extrapulmonary-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>], the genital organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-and-treatment-of-extrapulmonary-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-26</a>], the prostate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-and-treatment-of-extrapulmonary-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>], the peritoneal cavity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-and-treatment-of-extrapulmonary-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], and the mediastinum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-and-treatment-of-extrapulmonary-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In a retrospective review of 33 pediatric cases, mediastinitis occurred in seven patients (21 percent) and occurred more commonly in younger children (median age, three years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-and-treatment-of-extrapulmonary-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Lesions have rarely been noted in the subserosal intestines, the heart, and the urinary bladder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1203451418\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of disseminated coccidioidomycosis should almost always be established by identifying <em>Coccidioides </em>in one or more sites outside the chest, either by visualizing spherules in histopathology specimens or by culture of a lesion in the affected organ. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening#H4081002621\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coccidioidomycosis: Laboratory diagnosis and screening&quot;, section on 'Recovery of Coccidioides spp from clinical specimens'</a>.)</p><p>A possible exception is in patients who have serum coccidioidal antibodies detected and destructive lesions that are in such a location that biopsy is deemed too difficult or too unsafe. Although patients with disseminated coccidioidal infection often have complement fixing antibody titers of 1:16 or greater, a high complement fixing antibody titer without demonstrable extrapulmonary lesions is usually not sufficient to diagnose disseminated infection. The specific diagnostic tests are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coccidioidomycosis: Laboratory diagnosis and screening&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of nonpregnant immunocompetent patients with extrapulmonary infection will be reviewed here. The management of immunocompromised hosts and pregnant women is discussed separately.

The following principles are covered in the consensus statement:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nearly all patients with disseminated infections should be treated with antifungal therapy. For nonpregnant patients who present with extrapulmonary nonmeningeal coccidioidomycosis and are <strong>without </strong>lesions that pose an emergency, we recommend an azole (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a>) as the initial drug of choice. The dose and duration depend upon the site of infection. (See <a href=\"#H2673133173\" class=\"local\">'Soft tissue infection without bone involvement'</a> below and <a href=\"#H178940532\" class=\"local\">'Bone and joint infection'</a> below and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Risk of relapse after treatment'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amphotericin B is usually reserved for patients with azole failure or those who have severe disease. (See <a href=\"#H178940532\" class=\"local\">'Bone and joint infection'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical debridement or stabilization is important and even critical as adjunctive treatment in some cases. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Special considerations'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>There are no trials comparing amphotericin with azole therapy. The decision to use an azole rather than amphotericin B for most patients with extrapulmonary disease is based upon the observed efficacy of these agents in uncontrolled studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-and-treatment-of-extrapulmonary-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>] and the reduced toxicity of azoles compared with amphotericin B. The use of amphotericin B instead of an azole for disease that could lead to significant compromise is based upon expert opinion that amphotericin B may exert an antifungal effect more quickly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-and-treatment-of-extrapulmonary-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Several prospective studies support the use of either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> for treatment of extrapulmonary coccidioidomycosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-and-treatment-of-extrapulmonary-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. In a randomized, blinded comparison of progressive nonmeningeal coccidioidal infections, 191 patients with chronic pulmonary, soft tissue, or skeletal lesions were randomly assigned to receive either fluconazole (400 mg once daily) or itraconazole (200 mg twice daily) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-and-treatment-of-extrapulmonary-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. After eight months of therapy, there was a nonsignificant increase in the number of patients who responded to itraconazole compared with fluconazole (61 of 97 [63 percent] versus 47 of 94 [50 percent]). However, in a secondary analysis, most of the apparent difference in response rates occurred in patients with skeletal lesions, in whom 12 of 23 (52 percent) receiving itraconazole responded compared with only 7 of 27 (26 percent) with fluconazole.</p><p>In this trial, relapse rates following the completion of 12 months of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> were 18 and 28 percent, respectively. However, relapse rates might be even higher than those recorded since many responding patients continued therapy off protocol. Moreover, a subanalysis indicated that patients continuing therapy were more likely to have had prior relapses, higher serologic titers, and greater extent of disease. An additional discussion of relapse after treatment discontinuation is found below. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Risk of relapse after treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2673133173\"><span class=\"h2\">Soft tissue infection without bone involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fluconazole</a> (400 mg daily) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> (200 mg twice daily) should be used for most patients with skin and soft tissue infection. The duration of treatment is 6 to 12 months. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Risk of relapse after treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>Amphotericin B should be used for those who fail azole therapy or for newly identified lesions that, because of their anatomic location, pose an emergency. An example of this might be a peritracheal abscess threatening to obstruct the airway. (See <a href=\"#H1203451511\" class=\"local\">'Retropharyngeal abscess'</a> below.)</p><p>There is less experience with the newer azoles (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posaconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">posaconazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a>); however, they appear to be effective in patients who fail to respond to other azoles. Posaconazole is a novel triazole agent that has potent in vitro activity against a wide range of fungal pathogens, including both yeasts and molds. Published data are limited but suggest efficacy as illustrated by the following findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an open-label study of 15 patients with chronic refractory coccidioidomycosis, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posaconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">posaconazole</a> (800 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> in divided doses) produced a complete response in four and a partial response in seven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-and-treatment-of-extrapulmonary-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The sites of involvement included lungs, bones, joints, skin, soft tissue, lymph nodes, central nervous system, eye, and heart valves.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar findings were noted in a series of 20 patients with chronic pulmonary or nonmeningeal disseminated coccidioidomycosis who were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posaconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">posaconazole</a> (400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-and-treatment-of-extrapulmonary-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Seventeen had a treatment response, defined as any reduction in Mycoses Study Group (MSG) score by week 16 and a &ge;50 percent reduction in the MSG score by week 24. The MSG score is based upon symptoms, clinical examination findings, serologic test results, and culture results.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective study that included 16 patients who received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posaconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">posaconazole</a> for the treatment of refractory coccidioidomycosis showed that many, but not all, patients experienced improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-and-treatment-of-extrapulmonary-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p/><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Voriconazole</a> has had limited use in patients with coccidioidomycosis, especially those with refractory infections. There are case reports and a small salvage study in children suggesting that voriconazole may be effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-and-treatment-of-extrapulmonary-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/40-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-43</a>]. In a review of disseminated coccidioidal infections, some patients were managed successfully with voriconazole treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-and-treatment-of-extrapulmonary-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Similarly, a retrospective study that included 21 patients who received voriconazole for the treatment of refractory coccidioidomycosis showed that many, but not all, patients experienced improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-and-treatment-of-extrapulmonary-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H178940532\"><span class=\"h2\">Bone and joint infection</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1394388798\"><span class=\"h3\">Antifungal therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with bone and joint infection, we administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> unless the patient has evidence of severe osseous disease, such as limb-threatening skeletal disease or vertebral infection causing imminent cord compromise. For such patients, we initiate amphotericin. The duration of treatment is a minimum of three years, and in some cases life-long. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Risk of relapse after treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>For those who can receive azoles, we administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> (800 mg daily) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> (200 mg twice daily). The dose of fluconazole used to treat bone and joint disease is higher than that used to treat skin and soft tissue infections. Although fluconazole (400 mg daily) and itraconazole (200 mg twice daily) are similar for treating chronic pulmonary and soft tissue coccidioidal lesions, itraconazole appears more potent than 400 mg daily of fluconazole for bone and joint disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-and-treatment-of-extrapulmonary-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/36,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,44</a>].</p><p>For patients with severe bone <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> joint disease that require amphotericin, we generally prefer a lipid formulation, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amphotericin-b-lipid-complex-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amphotericin B lipid complex</a> (5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> intravenous [IV] per day) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liposomal-amphotericin-b-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">liposomal amphotericin B</a> (3 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV per day). For such patients, we initiate amphotericin B daily for the first 10 or more days. After that, dosing can be extended to three times weekly. Amphotericin B is usually continued until the most serious lesions appear to have clinically stabilized or have started to improve. Patients can be concurrently treated with azole therapy or started on azole therapy after completing one month or more of amphotericin B. We usually use an azole with the amphotericin B unless pharmacologic factors or untoward reactions weigh against that choice. Certain patients with vertebral disease require surgical intervention as well. (See <a href=\"#H3234801025\" class=\"local\">'Surgical management'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3234801025\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgical management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with bone and joint infection, the optimal management may require combined medical and surgical interventions. However, it is frequently difficult to determine the need for surgery. We use the following approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Monoarticular arthritis</strong> &ndash; Monoarticular arthritis can be an unexpected diagnosis at the time of arthroscopy and even after total knee replacement. The infection may be limited completely to the synovium, and, in such cases, antifungal treatment without surgical intervention is often quite effective in completely resolving the signs and symptoms of infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vertebral osteomyelitis</strong> &ndash; Vertebrae are a common site for coccidioidal osteomyelitis. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We obtain surgical consultation for all patients with vertebral coccidioidal infection to help assess the need for surgical intervention. The management of these lesions is especially important because of their potential impact on the spinal cord and mobility.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For those with evidence of cord impingement, we initiate amphotericin B, and immediate surgical decompression is usually recommended. (See <a href=\"#H178940532\" class=\"local\">'Bone and joint infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients without cord compression and with stable vertebrae, antifungal therapy with either an amphotericin B formulation or an azole is often initiated without immediate surgical intervention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Subsequent management depends upon the evolution of lesions as evidenced by neurologic examination and repeated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), often within one or two months. For progressive lesions, surgical options are reconsidered. For those that are stable or show improvement, medical management alone is continued with repeated MRI at progressively longer intervals. The duration of antifungal therapy is individualized based on response to therapy. Courses of treatment with azoles are usually continued for several years, and in some cases are life-long, since relapse following the discontinuation of treatment can never be excluded.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coccidioidal-meningitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coccidioidal meningitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Special considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the diversity of possible locations and severity of coccidioidal lesions, guidelines cannot address all of the various situations that might be seen. The following specific examples have been commonly encountered by clinicians at the <a href=\"http://www.vfce.arizona.edu/&amp;token=DG1xappZF/iPlgUBKyuoWl3+aSym4xFcnSePTJFWC1G7QLqz9oOz59NDIHfBWuFz&amp;TOPIC_ID=2449\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Valley Fever Center for Excellence</a> and are illustrative of approaches followed within that program.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Supraclavicular adenopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One or more involved supraclavicular lymph nodes may be evident at the time of diagnosis. Patients with supraclavicular adenopathy are usually treated in a similar fashion to that used for disseminated skin and soft tissue lesions (see <a href=\"#H2673133173\" class=\"local\">'Soft tissue infection without bone involvement'</a> above). These lymph nodes occasionally drain spontaneously, but with therapy may resolve without requiring surgical resection.</p><p>The presence of enlarged supraclavicular nodes probably represents lymphatic drainage from the lung rather than hematogenous spread. However, the fact that infection has spread to involve the supraclavicular region suggests exceptional progression of infection along the lymphatic chain, indicating that host defenses are not effectively limiting the infection to the lungs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1203451511\"><span class=\"h3\">Retropharyngeal abscess</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retropharyngeal abscesses occur, but most likely represent extension of cervical osteomyelitis rather than lymphangitic spread from the mediastinum. Amphotericin B is typically administered in this setting given the risk of airway compromise. (See <a href=\"#H1394388798\" class=\"local\">'Antifungal therapy'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Solitary cutaneous lesions in children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A single small skin lesion is occasionally biopsied or excised and found on histopathology to be the result of coccidioidal infection. Most clinicians would recommend antifungal therapy in adults based upon this finding alone. However, in an otherwise healthy child with no other evidence of disseminated infection, some pediatricians familiar with coccidioidomycosis have elected to observe the patient closely rather than initiate therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Prostatic infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Occasional patients have been discovered to have an asymptomatic coccidioidal infection of the prostate; such infections are usually discovered during the evaluation of an elevated serum prostate-specific antigen level or less commonly during a fine needle biopsy of a palpable prostatic nodule. For patients with prostatic infection, the approach to treatment depends upon how the infection is identified.</p><p>For patients who are diagnosed using serology or fine needle biopsy, we typically follow them without treatment and monitor them with periodic office visits and coccidioidal serologies yearly or twice yearly. To date, none of the prostatic lesions have become symptomatic, nor has any patient developed a new lesion elsewhere.</p><p>By contrast, if coccidioidal involvement of the prostate is discovered as the result of a transurethral or radical prostatectomy, the greater anatomic disruption of these procedures compared with a fine needle biopsy greatly increases the risk of subsequent complications from the infection. In these situations, antifungal therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> (400 mg daily) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> would be appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-and-treatment-of-extrapulmonary-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of relapse after treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who respond to antifungal therapy, there is a potential for relapse once treatment is discontinued. In the trial comparing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> treatment cited above, relapse rates following the completion of 12 months of therapy were 28 and 18 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-and-treatment-of-extrapulmonary-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. However, these relapse rates likely are under-estimates since many treating providers were unwilling to stop treatment at the end of study. (See <a href=\"#H681327329\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p>Most relapses occur at the site of previously identified lesions rather than at new sites. Although it is reasonable to discontinue therapy at least once for most patients, some clinicians may elect to continue treatment indefinitely if the site of the initial lesion is particularly critical, because a recurrence, even if detected early, might be deleterious to the patient. The management of coccidioidomycosis in immunocompromised hosts, who may require antifungal therapy indefinitely, is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coccidioidomycosis in compromised hosts&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">ADJUNCTIVE INTERFERON-GAMMA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because cellular immunity is important in the immune control of coccidioidal infection, there has been interest in using interferon-gamma for patients with disseminated infection or other serious complications, although the efficacy of this approach has not been proven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-and-treatment-of-extrapulmonary-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. A case of disseminated coccidioidomycosis in a patient with an interferon-gamma receptor mutation has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-and-treatment-of-extrapulmonary-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. This mutation has previously been associated with atypical mycobacterial infections and, in fact, this patient had a history of <em>Mycobacterium chelonae</em> and <em>Mycobacterium kansasii </em>infections. For patients with this mutation, interferon-gamma is thought to be beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-and-treatment-of-extrapulmonary-coccidioidomycosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. These observations are likely to stimulate additional study of specific mutations that may predispose patients to disseminated coccidioidomycosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

These organisms are endemic to certain arid regions of the western hemisphere. Infection is virtually always acquired by inhalation, and primary infection frequently goes unrecognized. Dissemination of infection beyond the lungs can occur, but it is difficult to estimate the incidence of overt disseminated disease. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Incidence of disseminated infections'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disseminated infection represents a progression of primary infection, frequently becoming evident within weeks and usually within two years after the initial exposure. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extrapulmonary dissemination is usually the result of hematogenous spread of the organism. The common involvement of lymph nodes suggests that some, if not most, disseminated infections result from lymphatic drainage, eventually to the common lymphatic duct and from there to the rest of the body. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common sites of disseminated lesions are skin, subcutaneous soft tissue, meninges, and skeleton.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Skin, subcutaneous, and skeletal lesions typically become evident in a subacute or chronic fashion. The timing and nature of the symptoms depends upon the exact location and number of individual lesions. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Of all sites of dissemination, meningitis is the most serious and poses special problems in management, which are addressed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coccidioidal-meningitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coccidioidal meningitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis of disseminated infection should almost always be based upon biopsy evidence of <em>Coccidioides</em> outside the chest. (See <a href=\"#H1203451418\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For nonpregnant patients who present with extrapulmonary nonmeningeal coccidioidomycosis and are <strong>without</strong> lesions that pose an emergency (eg, peritonsillar abscess, cord compression), we recommend initial therapy with an azole rather than amphotericin B (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fluconazole</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> is typically used; the dose and duration depend upon the site of infection. Amphotericin B is usually reserved for individuals who have lesions that could cause significant compromise or for patients who have failed azole therapy. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients can be treated with antifungal therapy alone. However, for certain patients (eg, those with vertebral involvement causing cord compression), surgical debridement or stabilization may be important as adjunctive treatment. (See <a href=\"#H3234801025\" class=\"local\">'Surgical management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who respond to antifungal therapy, there is a potential for relapse once treatment is stopped. Thus, long-term antifungal therapy may be warranted if the site of the initial lesion is particularly critical, since a recurrence, even if detected early, might be seriously deleterious. However, for others, it is reasonable to discontinue treatment at least once.
