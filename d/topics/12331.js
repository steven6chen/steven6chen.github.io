Chorea may be caused by hereditary neurodegenerative diseases, follow structural damage to deep brain structures, or be associated with autoimmune disorders, metabolic derangement, or certain drugs and hormones. Investigation is oriented at searching for a secondary or reversible cause of chorea or confirming a hereditary condition with genetic testing. Although the chorea arriving from acquired conditions may be reversed, there is usually no specific therapy for hereditary neurodegenerative disorders. Symptomatic treatment can reduce abnormal movements regardless of the cause.</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of the various types of chorea.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29672540\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chorea, athetosis, and ballism frequently coexist in the same patient and are felt to be part of the same choreiform spectrum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chorea/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chorea&nbsp;is a hyperkinetic movement disorder characterized by rapid and unpredictable contractions affecting mostly distal limbs, but also the face and trunk. The movements are involuntary and nonpatterned with variable speed, timing, and direction, flowing from one body part to another and giving, in less severe cases, an appearance of fidgetiness. The unpredictable nature of chorea is a feature that distinguishes it from tremor and dystonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chorea/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Athetosis refers to slower, writhing movements with a sinuous quality. The term choreoathetosis is used when typical choreic movements coexist with athetosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ballism refers to involuntary movements that are proximal and large amplitude (in contrast to distal, low amplitude contractions typical of chorea) with a flinging or kicking character. Ballism is most often unilateral (hemiballism) and although present at rest, it becomes more prominent with action [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chorea/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29672548\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The structures involved in the production of chorea are the caudate nucleus, putamen, subthalamic nucleus, thalamus, and their interconnecting pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chorea/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. Chorea results from damage or dysfunction of these structures that causes an imbalance between indirect and direct pathways in the basal ganglia circuitry, leading to excessive dopaminergic activity. Disruption of the indirect pathway with loss of inhibition to the pallidum allows hyperkinetic movements to occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chorea/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The disruption of basal ganglia circuitry may be due to structural damage, selective neuronal degeneration, neurotransmitter receptor blockade, metabolic derangements, or autoimmune conditions. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29672556\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of choreas as a whole is unknown since there are no community-based studies available. Huntington disease is the most frequent cause of hereditary chorea, with a worldwide prevalence rate of approximately 3 per 100,000. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Huntington disease: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>The most common cause of acquired chorea in adults is likely levodopa-induced dyskinesia. In an Italian series of 51 consecutive cases of chorea admitted to several neurology departments over a five-year period, the most frequent etiologies of chorea were vascular (40 percent), drug-induced (14 percent), Huntington disease (10 percent), and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (10 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chorea/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Other causes were found in less than 5 percent of patients, and the diagnosis remained unknown in 6 percent.</p><p>In children, Sydenham chorea accounts for up to 96 percent of acute chorea cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chorea/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sydenham-chorea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sydenham chorea&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29672564\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chorea is usually classified as being primary (idiopathic, hereditary) or secondary (acquired). </p><p>Hereditary choreas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F95649\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95649 \">table 1</a>) tend to develop insidiously and are generally symmetrical, whereas acquired choreas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F95650\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95650 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F95651\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95651 \">table 3</a>) are more likely to be acute or subacute and can be asymmetrical or unilateral. Therefore, choreas could also be divided according to their mode of onset (acute or insidious) or their distribution (unilateral or bilateral). In any case of unilateral chorea, a focal lesion should be sought. Age of onset can also be used to classify choreas. In children, most cases of chorea are acquired and develop acutely or subacutely, the most common etiology being Sydenham chorea.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29672572\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chorea usually affects the distal limbs and face, but may also interfere with respiration and phonation, resulting in slurred speech or involuntary vocalizations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chorea/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The continuous flow of movements may appear semi-purposeful and difficult to distinguish from restless or fidgety behavior. Moreover, patients may mask the chorea by incorporating choreic movements into voluntary movements (parakinesia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chorea/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Patients are often unaware of their abnormal movements, which are noted by family members.</p><p>Chorea is usually present at rest and may increase with distracting maneuvers, but disappears in sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chorea/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Patients with chorea often demonstrate motor impersistence, an inability to maintain an ongoing motor activity, such as holding the tongue out or maintaining a constant grip [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chorea/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>Chorea has the same phenomenology regardless of its etiology. Hence, the differential diagnosis relies on accompanying features, age, and mode of onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chorea/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29672584\"><span class=\"h1\">HEREDITARY CAUSES OF CHOREA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are many different causes of hereditary chorea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F95649\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95649 \">table 1</a>). Patterns of inheritance include autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked, as reviewed in the sections that follow.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29672591\"><span class=\"h2\">Autosomal dominant</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Important autosomal dominant causes of hereditary chorea include Huntington disease, C9ORF72 repeat expansions, Huntington disease-like syndromes, benign hereditary chorea, dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy, several types of spinocerebellar ataxia, and neuroferritinopathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29672598\"><span class=\"h3\">Huntington disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Huntington disease is reviewed here briefly and discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Huntington disease: Genetics and pathogenesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Huntington disease: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=huntington-disease-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Huntington disease: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Huntington disease (HD) is the most common cause of hereditary chorea. HD is caused by a cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) trinucleotide repeat expansion on chromosome 4p leading to an enlarged polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin protein. This protein is widely expressed in the human brain, but its exact function is unknown. In HD, neuronal loss occurs predominantly in the caudate and putamen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Huntington disease: Genetics and pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The normal huntingtin gene contains two alleles of 6 to 35 CAG repeats, whereas affected patients typically carry at least one allele with 40 repeats or more (fully penetrant autosomal dominant mutation). There is variable penetrance for expression of the HD phenotype with 36 to 39 CAG repeats. Full penetrance occurs at repeat sizes greater than 40. Individuals with early-onset HD tend to have a large number of CAG repeats, while those developing HD late in life typically have a low repeat number. Alleles with 40 to 50 CAG repeats are found in most patients with the adult form of HD. In comparison, juvenile HD is typically associated with alleles containing more than 60 CAG repeats. Expansion of the CAG repeat number over successive generations may cause an earlier and more severe phenotype in the offspring, termed anticipation. Aggregation of mutant huntingtin is a pathologic hallmark of the disease process. However, the precise role of aggregates in the pathogenesis of HD is controversial. The characteristic pathologic change in HD is diffuse, marked neuronal loss and atrophy predominantly involving the caudate than in the putamen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=huntington-disease-genetics-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Huntington disease: Genetics and pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Clinically, adult-onset HD is characterized by insidious development of chorea, cognitive decline, and behavioral changes leading to relentlessly increasing disability and ultimately death (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F57709\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57709 \">table 4</a>). The first symptoms typically occur at ages 30 to 50 years, but age of onset varies from childhood to the 80s. Chorea is a key feature of HD in adults, and the defining sign at the time of diagnosis. Psychiatric problems can include irritability, depression, dysphoria, agitation, apathy, anxiety, paranoia, delusions, and hallucinations. The dementia of HD is characterized by executive dysfunction. With disease progression, motor function slowly deteriorates. Chorea may eventually be replaced in advanced stages of HD by a parkinsonian akinetic-rigid state. The slow but relentless deterioration in cognitive and motor function causes significant morbidity and early mortality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=huntington-disease-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Huntington disease: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Onset of symptoms before 20 years of age is considered juvenile HD, and comprises &lt;10 percent of cases. The clinical presentation of juvenile HD is different from adults, and is marked by a combination of parkinsonism, dystonia, and myoclonus without prominent chorea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F61297\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61297 \">table 5</a>). Seizures are also common. Most have the akinetic-rigid syndrome termed the Westphal variant. Juvenile HD has a more rapid course with early dementia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bradykinetic-movement-disorders-in-children#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bradykinetic movement disorders in children&quot;, section on 'Juvenile onset Huntington disease'</a>.)</p><p>Axial MRI images through the lateral ventricles demonstrate typical and prominent findings of caudate atrophy in late-stage HD. The diagnosis of HD is based upon presence of the typical clinical features, a family history of the disease, and confirmatory genetic testing for the disease-causing trinucleotide (CAG) repeat expansion in the HTT gene. Approximately one percent of patients with a typical HD phenotype test negative for the HTT gene mutation. In such cases, several genetically heterogeneous disorders that are phenotypically similar to HD (ie, HD phenocopy syndromes) should be considered, particularly the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurodegenerative disease caused by repeat expansions in the C9ORF72 gene</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Huntington disease-like syndromes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spinocerebellar ataxia type 17</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benign hereditary chorea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuroferritinopathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chorea-acanthocytosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>McLeod syndrome</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wilson disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Familial prion disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Friedreich ataxia</p><p/><p>The diagnosis and differential diagnosis of HD is discussed in detail separately.

Limited available data suggest autosomal dominant transmission with incomplete penetrance. Mutations in the C9ORF gene involving the repeat expansion are the most common cause of familial frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and have been identified in some sporadic cases of FTD, ALS, and parkinsonism.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wilson-disease-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wilson disease: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical phenotype of Wilson disease is broad. The majority of patients with Wilson disease are diagnosed between the ages of 5 and 35 years, though it has been diagnosed in younger patients and in patients in their 70s. Unlike children, who are more likely to present with hepatic manifestations, older patients (mid-teens and older) are more likely to present with neurologic manifestations. Common neurologic manifestations of Wilson disease include tremor, dysarthria, ataxia, dystonia, parkinsonism, and drooling. Other symptoms can include risus sardonicus, tics, myoclonus, chorea, whispering dysphonia, seizures, and behavioral and cognitive changes. Nearly all patients with neurologic symptoms will exhibit Kayser-Fleisher rings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F65925\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65925 \">picture 1</a>) on careful slit lamp examination. These rings are gold, brown, or greenish and first become visible in the upper pole of peripheral cornea. Investigation demonstrates low ceruloplasmin levels in most patients (normal in 5 to 15 percent of cases), low serum copper levels, increased 24-hour urine copper excretion, and abnormal liver function tests. Liver biopsy or genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis.

It is caused by mutations in the ATM gene on chromosome 11; the ATM gene product is involved in the detection of DNA damage. The disease onset is usually between 1 to 4 years of age with progressive cerebellar ataxia. Over time, associated features become evident: conjunctival or facial telangiectasias, oculomotor apraxia, chorea, dystonia, myoclonus, and peripheral neuropathy. Associated features include immunodeficiency with recurrent sinus or pulmonary infections, an increased incidence of malignancy, radiation sensitivity, and diabetes mellitus caused by insulin resistance. The diagnosis is established by the presence of characteristic clinical findings (particularly progressive cerebellar ataxia) and identification of disabling mutations on both alleles for the ATM gene. It is supported by serum immunoglobulin A at least two standard deviations below normal for age and by increased spontaneous and radiation-induced chromosome fragility in cultured cells. In the appropriate clinical setting, the finding of a serum alpha-fetoprotein at least two standard deviations above normal for age is diagnostic of the disorder.

However, this disease begins later, between 20 and 50 years, and lacks the self-mutilation or eating difficulties typical of chorea-acanthocytosis. Associated features include cardiac involvement with cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias in about two-thirds. Acanthocytes are seen on peripheral blood smear.

The wide spectrum of neurologic symptoms (with some patients being asymptomatic) and severity of the disease have been associated with the degree of enzyme deficiency. Affected boys have delayed developmental milestones, mental retardation, and extrapyramidal and pyramidal motor symptoms; they also develop self-mutilating behavior.

It is one of the clinical manifestations of acute rheumatic fever, a nonsuppurative sequela of group A streptococcus infection. SC is an autoimmune disorder, thought to result from cross-reactivity between antibodies to group A streptococcal bacteria and striatal antigens. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sydenham-chorea#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sydenham chorea&quot;, section on 'Pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p>SC typically occurs in children between 5 and 15 years, although it has also been described in adults. Females are affected more frequently than males by a ratio of 2:1. As opposed to the other major manifestations (ie, arthritis, carditis, erythema marginatum, subcutaneous nodules) of acute rheumatic fever, which emerge one to three weeks after the inciting infection, SC is a later manifestation occurring commonly four to eight weeks after the infection, although it can be delayed up to eight months. Chorea develops subacutely and is generally bilateral, but 20 to 30 percent of cases will experience hemichorea. Affected patients can also exhibit tics, dysarthria, hypotonia, muscular weakness, gait disorder, and vocalizations. SC is often associated with psychological and psychiatric manifestations which may precede the onset of chorea, including emotional lability with irritability, inattention, hyperactivity, obsessive compulsiveness, anxiety, psychotic symptoms, and depression. The bouts of chorea typically last two to nine months followed by complete spontaneous resolution. However, a substantial proportion of patients has persistence of chorea after two years or has recurrences. Individuals who have developed SC are at increased risk of developing chorea associated with subsequent group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus pharyngitis, pregnancy, oral contraceptives, or other drugs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sydenham-chorea#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sydenham chorea&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of SC is made clinically, based on characteristic neurologic findings. Some patients with SC have no other manifestations of acute rheumatic fever but should have an evaluation for carditis with echocardiography. Since SC is a late manifestation of the streptococcal infection, throat culture at the moment of the chorea is usually negative and other signs of systemic inflammation have often abated. The antistreptolysin O titer is of limited use in patients with SC, because titers generally peak before the onset of SC symptoms and children without rheumatic fever or SC often have low positive titers of ASLO. The antideoxyribonuclease B titer is more useful for supporting the diagnosis of SC because it tends to remain elevated longer.

Withdrawal of the offending agent is the treatment of choice but does not always lead to remission of abnormal movements.</p><p>When chorea is related to chronic dopamine antagonist exposure (eg, antipsychotics and antiemetics such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoclopramide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoclopramide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prochlorperazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prochlorperazine</a>) that cross the blood brain barrier, it is called tardive dyskinesia; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=domperidone-united-states-available-via-fda-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">domperidone</a> does not result in tardive dyskinesia because it does not cross the blood-brain barrier. The minimal exposure required to produce tardive dyskinesia is unknown, but most authors believe that chronic therapy for more than six weeks is required. The prevalence can be as high as 30 percent after 18 months of treatment. The most robust risk factor for the development of tardive dyskinesia is older age. Other factors that have been tentatively associated with greater prevalence of tardive dyskinesia include female sex, brain damage, dementia, major affective disorder, diabetes, longer duration of antipsychotic drug exposure, use of anticholinergic-antiparkinson drugs, and a history of previous acute extrapyramidal reactions to antipsychotic drugs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tardive-dyskinesia-etiology-and-epidemiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tardive dyskinesia: Etiology and epidemiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Tardive dyskinesia is rare in children. Chorea related to dopamine receptor blocker use in children tends to occur with rapid discontinuation of the drug (rather than chronic use) and is called withdrawal emergent syndrome. In this setting, chorea is not restricted to the orofacial muscles and is often associated with other types of abnormal movements. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tardive-dyskinesia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tardive dyskinesia: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Once the offending medication has been withdrawn, the resolution of tardive movements can be a slow process (months to years) and is not assured.

Levodopa-induced dyskinesia consist of abnormal involuntary movements that are usually choreic or dystonic but may be ballistic or myoclonic when more severe.

Chronic and progressive chorea is typical of neurodegenerative diseases, whereas static chorea can be seen in structural or toxic injuries to basal ganglia or in benign hereditary chorea. Subacute or acute chorea can occur with autoimmune, metabolic, vascular, infectious, or toxic causes. Neurologic examination is also crucial and must include distribution of chorea and associated features.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemichorea can occur due to a structural lesion.

In suspected Sydenham chorea, other major or minor symptoms and signs of rheumatic fever should be sought, including evaluation for carditis; antideoxyribonuclease B and antistreptolysin O titers can be helpful. Screening for possible autoimmune chorea includes antinuclear antibodies and antiphospholipid antibodies, while a paraneoplastic evaluation would add <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-CRMP5/CV2</span> and anti-Hu antibodies.</p><p>Screening for Wilson disease with serum ceruloplasmin and 24-hour urine copper is recommended in any case of movement disorder under the age of 40 years, especially if there is a positive family history of neuropsychiatric disorders or a history of liver disease.

Specific considerations in appropriate settings include HIV testing, lumbar puncture for cerebrospinal fluid examination (including VDRL), Lyme serologies, and toxoplasmosis titers (in immunosuppressed patients).</p><p>Neuroimaging with brain MRI (preferred) or CT will help to rule out a structural lesion in patients with focal or unilateral choreas, but may also reveal evidence of hereditary, immunologic, or metabolic choreas, such as caudate and frontal atrophy in Huntington disease, cerebellar atrophy in spinocerebellar ataxia, or basal ganglia anomalies in neuroferritinopathy, chorea-acanthocytosis, Wilson disease, pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration, liver dysfunction, or hyperglycemia. </p><p>Genetic testing is available for many hereditary choreas, which allows confirmation of the diagnosis and genetic counselling to family members. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29672870\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF CHOREA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Secondary chorea often improves or resolves with appropriate treatment of the underlying cause or withdrawal of the offending agent. Unfortunately, no agent has been proven to slow or halt progression of hereditary choreas, with exception of decoppering therapies in Wilson disease. The mainstay of management in genetic choreas includes careful genetic counseling of affected patients and their relatives and symptomatic treatment of chorea and other symptoms if they cause functional disability or social embarrassment. The same agents used to reduce choreic movements in primary chorea can also be used for secondary chorea, although treatment is often unnecessary because many patients are unaware or untroubled by the movements.</p><p>The management of specific causes of chorea is reviewed in detail elsewhere:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Huntington disease (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=huntington-disease-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Huntington disease: Management&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Levodopa-induced dyskinesia in Parkinson disease (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=motor-fluctuations-and-dyskinesia-in-parkinson-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Motor fluctuations and dyskinesia in Parkinson disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sydenham chorea (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sydenham-chorea#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sydenham chorea&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wilson disease (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wilson-disease-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wilson disease: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p>In general, dopamine receptor blockers are the most effective agents to reduce the severity of choreic movements regardless of the cause.

The movements are involuntary and nonpatterned with variable speed, timing, and direction. Chorea, athetosis (slower, writhing movements with a sinuous quality), and ballism (involuntary movements that are proximal and large amplitude) frequently coexist in the same patient and are felt to be part of the same choreiform spectrum. (See <a href=\"#H29672540\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The structures involved in the production of chorea are the caudate nucleus, putamen, subthalamic nucleus, thalamus, and their interconnecting pathways. (See <a href=\"#H29672548\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chorea is usually classified as being primary (idiopathic, hereditary) or secondary (acquired). Hereditary choreas tend to develop insidiously and are generally symmetrical, whereas acquired choreas are more likely to be acute or subacute and can be asymmetrical or unilateral. In children, most cases of chorea are acquired and develop acutely or subacutely, the most common etiology being Sydenham chorea. (See <a href=\"#H29672564\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are many different causes of hereditary chorea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F95649\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95649 \">table 1</a>). Patterns of inheritance include autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked. Important autosomal dominant causes include Huntington disease, C9ORF72 repeat expansions, Huntington disease-like syndromes, benign hereditary chorea, dentatorubral pallidoluysian atrophy, several types of spinocerebellar ataxia, and neuroferritinopathy. Important autosomal recessive causes of hereditary chorea include chorea-acanthocytosis, Wilson disease, pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration, ataxia-telangiectasia, and ataxia with oculomotor apraxia. The main X-linked causes of chorea include McLeod syndrome and Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H29672584\" class=\"local\">'Hereditary causes of chorea'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of acquired conditions can cause chorea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F95650\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95650 \">table 2</a>). These include central nervous system vascular lesions, <span class=\"nowrap\">autoimmune/inflammatory</span> disorders, particularly Sydenham chorea, metabolic and endocrine disorders, infectious diseases, toxins, drugs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F95651\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95651 \">table 3</a>), structural lesions of the basal ganglia, and so-called senile chorea.
