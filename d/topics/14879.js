In contrast to asthma in pregnancy, relatively few studies have examined the management of other allergic disorders in pregnant women.</p><p>This topic reviews the recognition and management of rhinitis, urticaria, angioedema, and AD in pregnancy, as well as general principles of medication use during pregnancy. The diagnosis and management of asthma in pregnancy, anaphylaxis in pregnancy, the various dermatoses of pregnancy, and the management of allergic rhinitis in nonpregnant patients are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-and-clinical-course-of-asthma-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology and clinical course of asthma in pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-asthma-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of asthma during pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-in-pregnant-and-breastfeeding-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis in pregnant and breastfeeding women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dermatoses-of-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dermatoses of pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-of-allergic-rhinitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy of allergic rhinitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">General approach to treating allergy in pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In any form of allergic disease, a primary element of management is avoidance of the culprit allergen, when possible. Allergen avoidance is particularly important during pregnancy because the use of systemic medications should be minimized, if possible.</p><p>Women with significant allergic disease should ideally be evaluated <strong>before</strong> they become pregnant, so that any skin testing, challenge procedures, or other exposures that might be necessary for definitive diagnosis can be safely performed. This is especially important for women with the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allergies to medications that may be needed during pregnancy, such as local anesthetics or drugs used in general anesthesia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-anaphylaxis-evaluation-and-prevention-of-recurrent-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative anaphylaxis: Evaluation and prevention of recurrent reactions&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allergies for which there are definitive treatments, such as stinging insect venom (yellow jackets, bees, fire ants, others). Some patients with these allergies are candidates for venom immunotherapy, which can be continued during pregnancy but should not generally be initiated in a woman who is already pregnant. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-efficacy-indications-and-mechanism-of-action#H3876716647\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hymenoptera venom immunotherapy: Efficacy, indications, and mechanism of action&quot;, section on 'Pregnant women'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any woman who has experienced anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis can be devastating to both the mother and fetus. As a result, it is imperative to prevent a recurrence during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-in-pregnant-and-breastfeeding-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis in pregnant and breastfeeding women&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Systems for assessing drug safety in pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When considering the use of medications in a pregnant woman, the potential risk of a drug must be balanced against the effects of untreated disease. Despite the potential for harm, few drugs have been proven harmful in pregnancy, and fewer than 1 percent of congenital malformations can be attributed to drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-allergic-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, statistical and ethical considerations make it unlikely that any drug will ever be &quot;proven safe.&quot; A general discussion of the assessment of the risk of medication use based upon animal and human studies is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-care-patient-education-health-promotion-and-safety-of-commonly-used-drugs#H2095976199\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal care: Patient education, health promotion, and safety of commonly used drugs&quot;, section on 'Safety of selected common medications used transiently in pregnancy'</a>.)</p><p>Many allergic disorders can be managed with topical medications, including nasal sprays, eye drops, and topical lotions and creams. These preparations allow the drug to be concentrated at the site of inflammation, so that less total drug is required to obtain clinical benefit. However, not all topical preparations are considered appropriate for use in pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Anaphylaxis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Rhinitis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Urticaria and angioedema'</a> below and <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Atopic dermatitis'</a> below.)</p><p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) previously established five categories (A, B, C, D, and X) to describe a drug's potential for causing adverse effects during pregnancy and mandated that drugs introduced after 1980 be classified into one of these categories in the package insert (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DRUG%2F50021\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50021 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-allergic-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The categories are based upon the results of animal studies, human data, and consideration of whether the benefit of the drug's use during pregnancy outweighs the risk. In 2015, the FDA began overseeing the phase-out of pregnancy risk categories from prescription drug labeling and began requiring information from available human and animal studies of (1) known or potential maternal or fetal adverse reactions and (2) dose adjustments needed during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Additional information is available on the FDA website [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-allergic-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A general discussion of the assessment of the risk of medication use based upon animal and human studies is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-asthma-during-pregnancy#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of asthma during pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Assessing drug safety in pregnancy'</a>.)</p><p>In the interim, it is helpful for clinicians to be aware of the categories assigned to allergy medications within the older system. There are no allergy medications that meet the requirements for category A (adequately controlled studies show no risk) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DRUG%2F50021\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50021 \">table 1</a>). Most category B drugs are labeled as such because of reassuring animal studies without &quot;adequate and controlled&quot; human data. One may wish to choose a class B versus a class C drug (risk cannot be ruled out) among equally effective alternatives due to the reassuring animal studies.</p><p>Among commonly used allergy medications, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">budesonide</a> (inhaled and intranasal), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cromolyn-sodium-cromoglicate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cromolyn</a> sodium, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetirizine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetirizine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levocetirizine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levocetirizine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loratadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loratadine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omalizumab</a> were assigned category B.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ANAPHYLAXIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anaphylaxis is uncommon during pregnancy.

A variety of devices, including bulb syringes and bottle sprayers, may be used to perform nasal lavage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F71059\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71059 \">table 2</a>). Patients should use at least 200 mL in each nostril. This can be performed daily or only as needed for intermittent symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-allergic-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In a randomized trial of pregnant women, nasal saline irrigation was shown to be beneficial for treatment of allergic rhinitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-allergic-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Exercise</strong> &ndash; Regular physical exercise can help by causing physiologic nasal vasoconstriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-allergic-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nasal dilator strips</strong> &ndash; Adhesive strips that mechanically hold the nasal valves open (external nasal dilators) are available over-the-counter and can be useful at night [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-allergic-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Elevation of the head of the bed by 30 to 45 degrees</strong> &ndash; Placing bricks or other objects under the legs of the bed is more effective than using extra pillows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-allergic-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy rhinitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnancy normally induces hyperemia and edema of the nasal mucosa.

Pregnancy rhinitis may be defined as nasal symptoms during pregnancy lasting six or more weeks without other signs of respiratory tract infection and with no known allergic cause, disappearing completely within two weeks after delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-allergic-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Nasal congestion can lead to mouth breathing at night and reduced quality of sleep. The other causes of rhinitis listed above must be excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-allergic-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The pathophysiology of pregnancy rhinitis is not known. In the past, it was attributed to changes in estrogen <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> progesterone, although there is little specific evidence to support this assertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-allergic-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Smoking and allergic sensitization to dust mites were identified as risk factors for the development of pregnancy rhinitis in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-allergic-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, neither asthma nor hay fever is more common among women who develop pregnancy rhinitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnancy rhinitis does not usually require therapy, nor does it respond well to medications. In those who seek specific treatment, nonpharmacologic measures are suggested. (See <a href=\"#H2251392\" class=\"local\">'Nondrug therapies'</a> above.)</p><p>Several medications have been studied in pregnancy rhinitis, although none have demonstrated clear efficacy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intranasal glucocorticoid sprays were <strong>not</strong> beneficial for pregnancy rhinitis in a randomized trial of 53 women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-allergic-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pseudoephedrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pseudoephedrine</a> is also occasionally used for severe pregnancy rhinitis, although oral vasoconstrictors should be avoided in the first trimester and in women with hypertension. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Decongestants'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The presence of pregnancy rhinitis can complicate the diagnosis of coexisting upper respiratory tract infections or sinusitis, and these disorders should be considered in women who seek evaluation for nasal symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-respiratory-infections-in-pregnant-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of respiratory infections in pregnant women&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect of pregnancy on pre-existing rhinitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pre-existing rhinitis may worsen, improve, or remain unchanged during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-allergic-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These trends are similar to those seen with asthma, and one study found concordance between the course of asthma and that of rhinitis during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-allergic-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. This suggests that mechanistic factors involved in both diseases may be similarly altered during pregnancy.</p><p>Data suggest that rhinitis does not directly affect pregnancy outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-allergic-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, uncontrolled rhinitis can indirectly affect pregnancy by impacting gestational nutrition, sleep, or stress. In addition, uncontrolled rhinitis may be a cause of snoring, which may increase the risk of gestational hypertension, preeclampsia, and intrauterine growth retardation, although not all studies have confirmed this association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-allergic-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>].</p><p>Uncontrolled rhinitis may also predispose to sinusitis or exacerbate coexisting asthma during pregnancy. In a study of 218 pregnant women with asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-allergic-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], the presence and severity of rhinitis was associated with the level of asthma control. Thus, appropriate management of rhinitis during pregnancy can help women avoid exposures to other medications, such as antibiotics and oral glucocorticoids.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Allergic rhinitis/conjunctivitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Allergic rhinitis is usually pre-existing, although it may develop or be recognized for the first time during pregnancy. Patients with allergic rhinitis often report prominent sneezing, nasal pruritus, and watery rhinorrhea, and some have concomitant ocular itching and irritation. Common triggers for allergic rhinitis include dust mites, animal danders, molds, and pollens.

Thus, in vitro tests are preferred during pregnancy for identification of specific inhalant allergens to which a previously untested patient is sensitive.</p><p>In vitro tests for allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) are widely available, and the use of these tests in the diagnosis of allergic rhinitis is reviewed in detail elsewhere. Alternatively, therapy can be initiated empirically, even if the causative allergens are not known.

Three human studies of over 600 pregnancies, including first trimester use, failed to detect any increased risk for congenital defects with inhaled cromolyn sodium, although there are no safety data specific to nasal or ophthalmic preparations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-allergic-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Dosing of intranasal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cromolyn-sodium-cromoglicate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cromolyn</a> is one spray per nostril up to six times daily.

The lowest effective dose should be used during pregnancy.</p><p>The safety of glucocorticoid nasal sprays in pregnancy is based on reassuring data from glucocorticoid inhalers for asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-allergic-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], which deliver higher doses than nasal sprays. The overall safety of intranasal glucocorticoids in pregnancy was confirmed by a 2016 study of over 140,000 pregnant women, of whom 2502 were exposed to these medications during the first trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/recognition-and-management-of-allergic-disease-during-pregnancy/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. There was no increase in overall rates of major congenital malformations or spontaneous abortions among exposed patients. The only intranasal glucocorticoid for which there was a signal of potential concern was <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a>, which was associated with malformations of the respiratory system specifically (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 2.71 [95% CI 1.11-6.64]). This was based upon a small number of cases: Two cases of unspecified congenital malformations of the respiratory tract, one case of congenital malformations of the larynx, two cases of trachea and bronchus abnormalities, and one case of choanal atresia. Other agents were not associated with an excess of any specific abnormalities.
