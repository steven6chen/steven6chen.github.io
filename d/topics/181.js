Angioedema typically affects the skin or mucosal tissues of the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. The swelling is self-limited, although laryngeal involvement may cause fatal asphyxiation. Clinically, this disorder is very similar to hereditary angioedema (HAE), although acquired angioedema develops in older patients and is frequently associated with underlying disease, whereas the hereditary disorder presents in younger patients who are otherwise healthy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-c1-inhibitor-deficiency-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>This topic review will discuss the clinical manifestations, epidemiology, pathogenesis, and diagnosis of C1INH-AAE.

Episodes of angioedema typically last two to five days without treatment. Attacks are commonly triggered by trauma and psychological stress but may also occur without an apparent trigger.

Four patients (3 percent) were symptomatic with episodic swelling, and all four had both functional tests and levels of C1INH that were below 50 percent of normal.

Eradication of <em>H. pylori</em> was followed by reversal of the clinical symptoms and biochemical abnormalities of acquired angioedema, suggesting the possibility that this infection could have a pathogenetic role in the development of acquired angioedema. The author has seen a patient with echinococcus and acquired angioedema who improved after treatment of the infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-c1-inhibitor-deficiency-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. However, infections are unlikely to be related to pathogenesis in most patients, and we do not suggest an exhaustive search for infections unless there are suggestive clinical and laboratory findings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23301501\"><span class=\"h2\">Idiopathic cases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most series, fewer than 10 percent of patients have neither an associated disorder nor autoantibodies to C1INH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-c1-inhibitor-deficiency-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/19,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,30</a>]. The mechanism underlying acquired angioedema remains unknown in such patients. We can hypothesize that these individuals have antibodies to C1INH that elude detection in plasma because of a low titer or because they are bound to cell membranes. It is also possible that an entirely different mechanism exists in such patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>C1INH-AAE usually arises in the setting of an uncontrolled clonal proliferation of B lymphocytes. However, the mechanism by which clonal B cell disorders lead to depletion of C1INH and angioedema remains incompletely understood. Clonal B cell proliferation appears the pathologic process underlying C1INH-AAE that leads to production of C1INH-neutralizing autoantibodies and to non-Hodgkin lymphomas. The postgerminal center origin of non-Hodgkin lymphoma suggests that immune stimulation may contribute to lymphomagenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-c1-inhibitor-deficiency-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of bradykinin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The angioedema of C1INH-AAE appears to be mediated largely by bradykinin, as in hereditary angioedema (HAE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-c1-inhibitor-deficiency-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Tissue insult or injury normally activates the contact system, leading to the generation of bradykinin and other proinflammatory mediators. Bradykinin, acting through bradykinin B<sub>2</sub>-receptors, increases endothelial permeability via mechanisms involving nitric oxide, cyclic guanosine monophosphate (GMP), and other effector molecules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-c1-inhibitor-deficiency-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. Bradykinin production is normally regulated by C1INH.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1486440601\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibodies to C1 inhibitor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most (although not all) patients with acquired angioedema have identifiable autoantibodies against the C1INH protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-c1-inhibitor-deficiency-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/24,34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,34-36</a>]. In our patient group, we were able to detect these antibodies in 48 of 73 patients (66 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-c1-inhibitor-deficiency-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. One theory proposes that pathologic B lymphocyte proliferation results in expansion of a clone that produces antibodies that bind to C1INH (&quot;neutralizing antibodies&quot;), causing steric hindrance and a functional deficiency of the C1INH protein. Whether autoreactive clones may then evolve to lymphoma remains to be established. The unusually high prevalence of splenic marginal zone lymphoma in our population suggests that immune stimulation of postgerminal center B cells may contribute to the development of lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-c1-inhibitor-deficiency-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-extranodal-marginal-zone-lymphoma-of-mucosa-associated-lymphoid-tissue-malt\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Normally, C1INH interacts with its target proteases and is cleaved in the process. The cleaved and inactive inhibitor irreversibly binds to the protease and renders it inactive. However, in the presence of anti-C1INH antibodies, C1INH is still cleaved, but it cannot bind the protease, and the protease continues to function, leading to uncontrolled generation of bradykinin and angioedema. However, if this theory was correct, then acquired angioedema should result in essentially the same pattern of complement abnormalities as HAE, but this is not the case. Most patients with acquired angioedema demonstrate profound depletion of components of the classical complement pathway, including a low C1q (the measurable component of the C1 complex, C1q-r-s), which is not seen in patients with HAE. In addition, not all acquired angioedema patients with low C1q values have detectable anti-C1INH antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-c1-inhibitor-deficiency-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complement-pathways\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complement pathways&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The relationship between autoantibodies to C1INH and lymphoproliferative disorders in patients with acquired angioedema is not clear either. An early study identified these neutralizing antibodies in otherwise healthy acquired angioedema patients and hypothesized that acquired angioedema could arise from an autoimmune mechanism without an associated lymphoproliferative disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-c1-inhibitor-deficiency-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Based on this, two types of acquired angioedema were proposed: one paraneoplastic and the other autoimmune [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-c1-inhibitor-deficiency-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, subsequent work revealed that patients with and without autoantibodies to C1INH develop lymphatic malignancies over time and at similar rates, indicating that this distinction is not clinically or prognostically relevant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-c1-inhibitor-deficiency-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/11,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,38</a>]. Thus, the division of acquired angioedema into these two types has been abandoned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-c1-inhibitor-deficiency-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Activation of the classical complement pathway</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A second theory proposes that the pathogenesis of C1INH-AAE involves massive activation of the classical complement pathway by the neoplastic lymphoid tissue or by the abnormal antibodies and subsequent depletion of normally functioning C1INH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-c1-inhibitor-deficiency-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/15,25,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,25,39,40</a>].

With the appearance of the lymphoma, the patient's angioedema markedly worsened, and depletion of classical pathway complement components was apparent that had not been present before.

However, about 30 percent of the patients in two large series had C1q levels that were decreased but &gt;50 percent of normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-c1-inhibitor-deficiency-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/10,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,19</a>]. Finally, there are rare cases in which C1q levels are normal.</p><p>Note that complement abnormalities may fluctuate between normal and abnormal when the disorder first develops, becoming more consistently abnormal over the ensuing months. For this reason, mild abnormalities associated with a consistent clinical presentation should be followed over time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3419775\"><span class=\"h2\">Additional studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other diagnostic tests are only occasionally required. These include genotyping, detection of antibodies directed against C1INH, and detection of cleaved C1INH by gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. The indications for obtaining these tests are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3419782\"><span class=\"h3\">Genotyping</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In rare cases of acquired angioedema in which C1q is normal, the complement findings of acquired angioedema are identical to those in HAE. Genotyping for mutations in the C1INH gene (<em>SERPING1</em>), which are only found in HAE, would be the only definitive way to differentiate these disorders. However, genetic testing is not widely available. If testing is not available, we recommend screening and monitoring patients who appear to develop HAE over the age of 40 years for underlying lymphoproliferative diseases. (See <a href=\"#H3419824\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for underlying disorders'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3419789\"><span class=\"h3\">Detection of anti-C1INH antibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The other biochemical finding that is characteristic of acquired angioedema is the presence of anti-C1INH autoantibodies in plasma. By comparison, approximately 30 percent of patients with HAE have these antibodies, as well as 3 percent of normal controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-c1-inhibitor-deficiency-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. As with other autoantibodies, the definition of a pathologic level is relatively arbitrary. In our laboratory, we find clinically irrelevant positive values at minimal dilutions and consider positive results at dilutions less than 1:20 to be background noise due to natural autoantibody. No commercial assay for measuring these antibodies is available, although an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system can be set up in specialized laboratories and yields reliable results for investigational purposes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-c1-inhibitor-deficiency-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/36,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,44</a>]. Therefore, the finding of high titers of anti-C1INH antibodies in a patient's serum is supportive of the diagnosis of acquired angioedema, but the absence of these antibodies does not exclude the disorder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3419796\"><span class=\"h3\">Electrophoresis for inactive inhibitor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An additional test that may help to refine the diagnosis of acquired angioedema is the detection of cleaved C1INH by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunoblotting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-c1-inhibitor-deficiency-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. C1INH normally interacts with its target protease and is cleaved by this interaction. Cleaved C1INH then irreversibly binds to the protease, rendering it inactive. However, in the presence of anti-C1INH antibodies, C1INH is cleaved but cannot bind the protease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-c1-inhibitor-deficiency-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The protease then continues to function while cleaved, but inactive C1INH remains in the circulation. The cleaved, inactive form can be distinguished by electrophoresis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-c1-inhibitor-deficiency-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-diagnosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. In contrast, the routine quantitative assay for antigenic levels of C1INH cannot distinguish between cleaved inactive and uncleaved active C1INH, which explains why patients with acquired angioedema can have normal C1INH antigenic levels and low function with standard complement tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3419803\"><span class=\"h2\">Obstacles to diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is our clinical impression that acquired angioedema frequently evades diagnosis for a period of years. We believe there are several obstacles to diagnosis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Even among specialists, awareness of the existence of an acquired form of C1INH deficiency is not widespread, and uncertainties regarding the pathogenesis and laboratory features of the disorder further complicate diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with acquired angioedema lack a family history, so cases are not detected through family screenings, as with the hereditary form.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of a coexisting lymphoproliferative malignancy can overshadow other medical issues, including recurrent angioedema, which may be attributed to a paraneoplastic phenomenon and not evaluated further.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because the disorder begins later in life, many patients are taking multiple medications, and the episodes of angioedema are attributed to drug-allergic reactions. Similarly, patients may have multiple comorbidities, and the evaluation of angioedema may not take precedence until a severe attack occurs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complement abnormalities may fluctuate between normal and abnormal when the disorder first develops, becoming more consistently abnormal over the ensuing months.

Swelling most often involves the subcutaneous tissues of the face and the submucosa of the upper airway and small bowel. Acquired angioedema presents in the fourth decade of life or later. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 70 percent of patients with acquired angioedema are found to have an associated disorder. In one-half of these cases, the disorder is malignant (most often non-Hodgkin lymphoma), and in the other one-half, the associated condition is benign (most often monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance [MGUS]). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Associated disorders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Angioedema in C1INH-AAE is bradykinin-mediated, but the precise pathogenesis is undefined. Most patients have autoantibodies against the C1INH protein. These autoantibodies may impede the normal functioning of C1INH and cause a functional deficiency. Alternatively, the antibodies, or perhaps neoplastic tissue in some cases, may cause activation of the classical complement pathway, leading to depletion of normally functioning C1INH. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>C1INH-AAE should be considered in a patient who presents with isolated angioedema (without urticaria) in the fourth decade of life or later and has no family history of angioedema. (See <a href=\"#H3419754\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial testing should consist of levels of C4, C1q, and C1INH (antigenic level). If C4 and C1q are low and C1INH antigenic level is low or normal, then C1INH function should be obtained. Low C1INH function confirms the diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F64553\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef64553 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F83098\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83098 \">table 1</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H3419768\" class=\"local\">'Complement studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients with acquired C1INH disorders should be evaluated for an underlying B cell lymphoproliferative disorder at the time of diagnosis.
