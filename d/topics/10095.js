Some symptoms of low blood sugar are mild, such as sweating or feeling hungry. Others are severe, such as passing out. Another word for low blood sugar is &quot;hypoglycemia.&quot;</p><p>Low blood sugar happens most often in people with diabetes. It is uncommon in people who do not have diabetes. People without diabetes might feel like they have low blood sugar sometimes, but they most likely don't.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6621197\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes low blood sugar in people without diabetes?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Causes of low blood sugar in people without diabetes include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain medicines</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drinking alcohol, especially drinking a lot over a few days</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain illnesses that affect the liver or kidneys</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anorexia nervosa &ndash; This is an eating disorder that makes people lose more weight than is healthy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Growths or problems in the pancreas &ndash; The pancreas is an organ that makes hormones and juices that help the body break down food (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F61473\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61473 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As a side effect of weight loss surgery</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hormone conditions that some babies are born with</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6621212\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of low blood sugar?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of low blood sugar can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sweating or shaking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling hungry</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling worried</p><p/><p>If low blood sugar levels are not treated, severe symptoms can occur.

Other people have symptoms when they haven't eaten for many hours.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6621227\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I know if I have low blood sugar?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To be diagnosed with low blood sugar, you must meet certain conditions. You must:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have symptoms of low blood sugar</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a low blood sugar level when you have the symptoms </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feel better after you eat something that raises your blood sugar level to normal</p><p/><p>To check if you meet these conditions, your doctor will do blood tests when you have symptoms of low blood sugar. Your doctor might have you do things to bring on your symptoms so he or she can do the tests. For example, he or she might have you stop eating for a certain amount of time.</p><p>After your doctor knows for sure that you get low blood sugar, he or she will look for the cause. To do this, he or she might order tests, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other blood tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A CT scan, MRI scan, or ultrasound &ndash; These are imaging tests that can create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6621242\"><span class=\"h1\">How is low blood sugar treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment for low blood sugar involves both raising your blood sugar and treating the cause of your low blood sugar.</p><p>Your doctor or nurse will teach you how you can raise your blood sugar when it gets low. People usually raise their blood sugar by eating or drinking quick sources of sugar (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F67760\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67760 \">table 1</a>). Depending on your condition, your doctor might recommend that you carry a quick source of sugar with you at all times in case you need it.</p><p>If your blood sugar is so low that you are confused or passing out, and you are not able to eat anything, you will need to be treated with a glucagon shot. Glucagon is a hormone that can quickly raise blood sugar levels and stop severe symptoms. It comes in the form of a shot. If your doctor recommends that you carry a glucagon shot with you, he or she will tell you when and how to use it (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F50427\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50427 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F61722\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61722 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F74461\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74461 \">figure 2</a>). Family members should also learn how to give you a glucagon shot. That way, a family member can give it to you if you can't do it yourself.</p><p>Your doctor will also treat the condition that's causing your low blood sugar, if it can be treated. For example, if a medicine is causing your low blood sugar, your doctor can change or stop your medicine. If you have a growth in your pancreas, your doctor might do surgery to remove the growth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6621257\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I go to a hospital or call for an ambulance?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A family member or friend should take you to a hospital or call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1) if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Still have low blood sugar after you have had a quick source of sugar</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are still confused 15 minutes after being treated with a glucagon shot</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have passed out and there is no glucagon shot nearby</p><p/><p>If you have low blood sugar, do not try to drive yourself to the hospital. Driving with low blood sugar can be dangerous. Once you are in the hospital or ambulance, you will be given fluids with sugar into your vein. This treatment will raise your blood sugar level immediately.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6621272\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anorexia-nervosa-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anorexia nervosa (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=weight-loss-surgery-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Weight loss surgery (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diet-and-health-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diet and health (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
