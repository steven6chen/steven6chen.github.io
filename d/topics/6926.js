True aneurysms involving all layers of the carotid arterial wall and false aneurysms both occur. Overall, extracranial carotid artery aneurysm accounts for less than 1 percent of all arterial aneurysms and approximately 4 percent of peripheral artery aneurysms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Repair of extracranial carotid artery aneurysm represents 0.2 to 5 percent of carotid procedures depending upon the reporting institution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>A diagnosis may be made incidentally in asymptomatic patients or suspected based upon clinical manifestations that may include neurologic symptoms, a pulsatile mass in the neck, mass effects, or bleeding due to rupture. Any segment of the carotid artery (common, external, internal) can be affected, although the internal carotid artery is most commonly involved. </p><p>The treatment approach depends on the symptoms, etiology, and location of the carotid aneurysm. Observation is safe for some small, asymptomatic aneurysms, but repair is indicated for enlarging asymptomatic aneurysms to prevent stroke and aneurysm rupture, and for all symptomatic aneurysms. In most series, open surgical repair is more often selected for true aneurysms, infected aneurysms, and larger aneurysms causing mass effects. Endovascular repair is more often initially chosen for patients with pseudoaneurysms due to traumatic mechanisms or as a result of carotid dissection. </p><p>The classification, clinical features, and management of extracranial carotid artery aneurysm are reviewed here. Intracranial carotid artery aneurysms are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unruptured-intracranial-aneurysms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unruptured intracranial aneurysms&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-cerebral-aneurysms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of cerebral aneurysms&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H43534096\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY AND CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The extracranial carotid arteries include the common carotid artery, which originates in the chest, the external carotid artery, and the internal carotid artery to the base of the skull. The anatomy of the carotid arteries is illustrated in the figures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F51410%7ESURG%2F50495%7ESURG%2F63286\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51410 graphicRef50495 graphicRef63286 \">figure 1A-C</a>). </p><p>Aneurysms are categorized as either true or false aneurysms. True aneurysms are a segmental, full-thickness dilation of a blood vessel having at least a 50 percent increase in diameter compared with the expected normal diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. False aneurysm (pseudoaneurysm) is due to a localized disruption of the arterial wall, which can occur as a result of carotid trauma or prior carotid dissection, and represents a contained hematoma that has maintained a persistent connection with the arterial lumen. </p><p>The proportion of true aneurysm to pseudoaneurysm varies widely in case series, likely related to the specific demographics at individual institutions. As examples, one review of 42 cases from 1984 to 2004 at Baylor reported that 48 percent of extracranial carotid artery aneurysms were pseudoaneurysms and 52 percent were true aneurysms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, a separate review over a 15-year study period (1998 to 2012) from the Mayo Clinic that included 141 carotid aneurysms reported that 82 percent were pseudoaneurysms and 18 percent were true aneurysms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. More men were affected by pseudoaneurysm in this series, whereas for true aneurysm, the opposite was true. </p><p>Extracranial carotid aneurysms (true or false) have been classified according to affected anatomic segment, which is important for determining a treatment approach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F99993\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99993 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type I &ndash; Isolated aneurysms of the internal carotid artery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type II &ndash; Aneurysms of the complete internal carotid artery with involvement of the bifurcation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type III &ndash; Aneurysms of the carotid bifurcation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type IV &ndash; Combined aneurysm of the internal and common carotid artery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type V &ndash; Isolated aneurysm of the common carotid artery</p><p/><p>All segments of the carotid artery are susceptible to aneurysm formation; however, aneurysms affecting the very proximal carotid artery within the chest are rare.</p><p>For true aneurysm (typically atherosclerotic), the most frequent site reported in the literature reviews is the bifurcation of the carotid artery or proximal internal carotid artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Aneurysms at this site are typically fusiform. The middle and distal portions of the internal carotid artery are the next most common sites, and the appearance is typically saccular [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/8,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12</a>]. In the Mayo Clinic review, 114 (81 percent) involved the internal carotid, 11 (8 percent) the common carotid, 15 (10 percent) the bifurcation, and 1 (1 percent) the external carotid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Bilateral aneurysms can also occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/8,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10</a>]. </p><p>Infected pseudoaneurysms typically occur at the site of a prior patch repair in the proximal internal carotid artery, while traumatic pseudoaneurysms are more likely to affect the distal internal carotid artery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blunt cerebrovascular injury: Mechanisms, screening, and diagnostic evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28431629\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The factors leading to true aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm differ. True aneurysms are predominantly related to atherosclerosis, particularly in older individuals. However, other etiologies such as fibromuscular dysplasia, connective tissue disorders, inflammatory diseases, congenital defects, and irradiation can all predispose to full-thickness aneurysmal degeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/8,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11</a>]. Primary infection of the carotid artery wall can lead to true aneurysm, whereas, for those who have had prior carotid surgery or other intervention, secondary infection usually results in pseudoaneurysm. Blunt or penetrating trauma can result in either type of aneurysm depending upon the mechanism and severity of the arterial wall injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>The most common etiology of extracranial carotid artery aneurysm is atherosclerosis (34 to 42 percent), followed by trauma (35 to 51 percent) and pseudoaneurysm at prior endarterectomy sites (26 to 57 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a review of 42 patients with extracranial carotid artery aneurysms, 50 percent were due to atherosclerosis, 30 percent were pseudoaneurysms, and 12 percent were related to trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another report that included 48 patients, 71 percent were atherosclerotic, 25 percent pseudoaneurysm, and 4 percent related to infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. These are in contrast to an older series that found 57 percent of extracranial carotid artery aneurysms were the result of degeneration or infection of a previous carotid endarterectomy patch, and 43 percent were secondary to atherosclerosis and trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p/><p>Factors that increase the risk of extracranial carotid aneurysm are discussed briefly below, and in detail in the linked topic reviews, where available. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28431636\"><span class=\"h2\">Atherosclerosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atherosclerosis is the most common etiology for true extracranial carotid artery aneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/1,13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13,15</a>].

In the past, the onset of symptoms most often led to a diagnosis of extracranial carotid artery aneurysm, but asymptomatic aneurysms are increasingly discovered on cross-sectional imaging performed for unrelated reasons. Carotid aneurysms can also present as asymptomatic cervical or parapharyngeal masses, which may or may not be pulsatile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

Further evaluation is aimed at determining the etiology of the aneurysm (eg, post-endarterectomy, post-trauma), which can be challenging in some patients. Ultrasound is the initial imaging study to evaluate most neck masses, but advanced imaging is usually needed to further define the aneurysm (diameter, presence of thrombus, intracranial circulation, collateral circulation) and suggest an etiology, which may affect treatment decisions. Computed tomographic (CT) angiography and magnetic resonance (MR) angiography have replaced conventional catheter-based arteriography for diagnostic purposes at most vascular centers.

Sonographically, carotid pseudoaneurysms may be largely thrombosed with only a small amount of blood flow or may show large areas of swirling blood flow with little thrombus. Universally, however, a to-and-fro flow pattern should be seen in the neck of the pseudoaneurysm on spectral Doppler exam. The neck is the area connecting the carotid artery to the pseudoaneurysm masslike lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. </p><p>CT or MR angiography are useful confirmatory tests because they can assess the extent of aneurysmal dilation, thrombus formation, and the relationship of the aneurysm with surrounding structures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F100056\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef100056 \">image 1</a>). Multidetector three-dimensional CT angiography and MR imaging can be reconstructed to create three-dimensional images that provide additional information and a higher level of detail compared with angiography. </p><p>Arteriography is no longer necessary for making a diagnosis; however, it still has a role in the management of extracranial carotid artery aneurysm when a balloon occlusion test is necessary to assess collateral circulation, which is helpful to obtain preoperatively if ligation of the carotid artery is being considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

However, a thrombosed carotid artery aneurysm will also be nonpulsatile. It is important to distinguish carotid artery aneurysm from peritonsillar abscess. Attempted incision and drainage of a peritonsillar abscess that is really a carotid artery pseudoaneurysm can be fatal. (See <a href=\"#H596910777\" class=\"local\">'Physical findings'</a> above.)</p><p>A pulsatile neck mass may be vascular in origin, but a nonvascular mass that is closely related to the carotid or other artery in the neck can also seem to be pulsatile. Vascular etiologies causing a mass in the neck include carotid kinks and coils, and carotid tumors. Carotid kinks and coils are an anatomic variant. These redundant, tortuous carotid arteries can produce a large, pulsatile mass in the neck that is indistinguishable from extracranial carotid artery aneurysm on physical examination. Although it has been suggested that tortuosity can be distinguished on physical examination by evaluating the pulsation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] (the pulsation of a kinked carotid artery is said to run parallel to the long axis of the vessel as opposed to radiating laterally, as occurs in an aneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]), we do not rely on examination, but rather on carotid imaging to make the distinction. </p><p>A carotid body tumor can also present as a painless, pulsatile mass given its close proximity to typically the carotid bifurcation.

There are few large reviews to guide management of extracranial carotid artery aneurysm, and most decisions regarding care are derived from single-institution series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/1,4,7,9,31,51,56,60,62-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,7,9,31,51,56,60,62-67</a>]. Although specific management depends upon the factors discussed below, we generally repair all symptomatic extracranial carotid artery aneurysms (open or endovascular), as well as asymptomatic aneurysms that are large (&gt;2 cm), those with intraluminal thrombus (regardless of symptoms), and small asymptomatic aneurysms that demonstrate expansion on serial imaging (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F101608\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101608 \">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p>The mortality rate for untreated extracranial carotid artery aneurysm was historically quite high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/68-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-71</a>]. In the absence of advanced three-dimensional imaging that identifies small aneurysms, often incidentally, these older studies likely reflected predominantly aneurysms that were symptomatic and large enough to be identified on physical examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/3,49,50,62,72-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,49,50,62,72-74</a>]. Nevertheless, the reported mortality rate was at least twice as high as the mortality rate for the most morbid surgical procedure, which is carotid artery ligation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/53,68,69,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,68,69,75</a>].

Observation of small, asymptomatic aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms (eg, blunt trauma, dissection) is acceptable, but we have a low threshold to proceed with repair in any patient with signs of aneurysm expansion, or the development of thrombus within the aneurysm on serial imaging (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F101608\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101608 \">algorithm 1</a>). Symptomatic patients who are not candidates for any repair due to comorbidities may also be observed, but with the availability of endovascular techniques most symptomatic patients can be treated.

Nonoperative management was more frequent in asymptomatic patients than in symptomatic patients (71 versus 31 percent). The average diameters of true and pseudoaneurysms treated nonoperatively were 12.0 and 10.2 mm, respectively, compared with those that were managed operatively at 21.2 and 20.9 mm. No aneurysm managed nonoperatively required intervention during a mean follow-up of 77&nbsp;months.

We also treat asymptomatic extracranial carotid artery aneurysms that are large or expanding; however, what defines large or expanding is not firmly established. Some vascular specialists repair asymptomatic carotid artery aneurysms larger than 1.5 times the diameter of the adjacent normal artery (which essentially defines aneurysm), but based upon available observational data, we generally use a cutoff of around 2 cm.

Ruptured extracranial carotid artery aneurysm or rapidly expanding pseudoaneurysm mandates rapid control of the patient's airway and emergent open surgery to control hemorrhage. Ligation may be necessary to control bleeding in patients with ruptured carotid aneurysm or acute traumatic carotid pseudoaneurysm. Although not a preferred technique for elective extracranial carotid aneurysm repair, ligation may also be needed for some mycotic aneurysms or other circumstances for which distal control for bypass cannot be obtained for anatomic reasons. Some clinicians believe that disruptions that occur shortly after an endarterectomy, that do not appear to be due to infection, may be amenable to an endovascular approach to reduce potential complications related to the intense inflammatory changes in the immediate postoperative period surrounding the carotid artery.</p><p>As with other vascular pathologies, an endovascular approach is becoming increasingly popular. In a retrospective review at a single institution, patients treated during the first 10 years of the study period underwent open surgical repair exclusively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. By comparison, during the second 10 years, only 30 percent were treated with open surgery, while the remainder underwent endovascular repair. Another single-institution review noted a similar trend for more endovascular intervention in more recent years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Potential advantages of the endovascular approach are avoidance of cranial nerve injury, access to lesions that may be difficult to access or control with an open approach, and avoidance of general anesthesia. A concern about endovascular treatment compared with open surgery is the lack of long-term data. Thus, endovascular intervention is reserved for elective situations that involve a high inaccessible lesion, a hostile neck where the risk of cranial nerve injury is high, or in a poor surgical candidate with multiple comorbidities who cannot tolerate general anesthesia. </p><p>There are no randomized trials comparing open surgery and endovascular repair for the treatment of extracranial carotid artery aneurysm. Given the rarity of carotid aneurysm, and the generally low morbidity and mortality rates associated with intervention, it is unlikely that recruitment of a sufficient number of patients could be achieved to meaningfully compare these approaches. It should be noted, though, that the results of trials comparing open and endovascular therapy for carotid atherosclerotic occlusive disease are not sufficiently generalizable to carotid aneurysm to justify choosing one approach over the other, given that the etiology, pathology, location of disease, and patient populations are sufficiently distinct (particularly carotid pseudoaneurysm). Nevertheless, similar to other studies comparing open and endovascular approaches, in retrospective reviews and institutional case series, an endovascular approach for extracranial carotid artery aneurysm appears to be associated with lower rates of perioperative morbidity and mortality but may be at the expense of device-related complications. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a single-institution review, the authors noted their practice was to use an endovascular approach only in the treatment of pseudoaneurysms due to their belief that the causes of the pseudoaneurysms were self-limited, whereas the pathology of true aneurysms (including those related to connective tissue disease) was ongoing with further aneurysmal degeneration a possibility if treated by endovascular means [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a single-center cohort study, the rates of cranial nerve injury, 30-day mortality, and major stroke were significantly reduced in the cohort that underwent predominantly endovascular repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A systematic review that evaluated the outcomes of 224 patients from 113 separate reports who underwent endovascular stenting concluded that the endovascular approach had comparable, if not better, clinical outcomes compared with historical rates for stroke, cranial nerve injury, and mortality following open repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].

Covered stents and bare metal stents had similar procedural success rates, but compared with bare stents, covered stents had an increased rate of aneurysm sac thrombosis and significantly decreased rates of reintervention and overall late complications. </p><p>The sac can also be embolized with coils or other agents using microcatheters to inject the coils between the interstices of the stents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/81,84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">81,84,85</a>]. The proximal and distal landing sites are critical. For aneurysms that span the bifurcation, two overlapping stent-grafts with different diameters may be needed rather than a single stent-graft to account for the difference in diameter between the internal and common carotid artery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H391686427\"><span class=\"h2\">Follow-up imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following the procedure, carotid artery <span class=\"nowrap\">stent/stent-graft</span> patency should be monitored at regular intervals with ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) angiography at 30 days, three months, six months, and then annually.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H391682542\"><span class=\"h1\">MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perioperative mortality is similar for open compared with endovascular repair of extracranial carotid artery aneurysm. Complications of treatment include cranial nerve injury, stroke (perioperative and late), and <span class=\"nowrap\">graft/stent-specific</span> complications. For open repair, mortality ranges from 1.5 to 7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/3,4,12,14,56,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,12,14,56,60</a>]. Patients without infection as an etiology for the aneurysm typically fare better. In one study, during a mean follow-up of 4.6 years, 16 of 42 patients died, with 11 due to cardiac causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In a review that included 224 patients treated with endovascular repair of their carotid artery aneurysms, in-hospital mortality was 4.1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. However, none of the postoperative deaths were considered procedure related. After a mean follow-up period of 15 months, the non-procedure-related death rate was 2.4 percent. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H391682734\"><span class=\"h2\">Cranial nerve injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Injury to cranial nerves IX, X, and XII are a possible consequence of open repair. Cranial nerve injury is the most common complication of open extracranial carotid artery aneurysm repair, occurring in 5 to 44 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Risk factors for cranial nerve injury include distal internal carotid anatomy aneurysm, redo operations, infection, and prior irradiation. The incidence is higher for open extracranial carotid aneurysm repair compared with other elective carotid surgeries related to distorted anatomy and displacement of the cranial nerves in the neck. In addition, the nerves can firmly adhere to the aneurysm due to inflammation changes. Transient nerve dysfunction is more common than permanent nerve injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In one study that included 57 patients who underwent open repair, transient and permanent cranial nerve injury rates were 20.3 and 6.3 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The incidence of cranial nerve injury is significantly lower for endovascular repair compared with open surgical repair. In one systematic review of endovascular stenting, the incidence of cranial nerve injury was only 0.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H43566330\"><span class=\"h2\">Stroke</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following open surgical repair, the reported perioperative stroke rate ranged from 0 to 23 percent in a review that included series reported in 2000 through 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In this review, the late stroke rate was 0 to 6.2 percent. Two later series have reported perioperative and late stroke rates of 0 and 10 percent and 3 and 15 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/8,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,14</a>].</p><p>In a systematic review that included 224 patients treated with endovascular repair, the reported stroke rate was 1.8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Compared with patients with pseudoaneurysms, patients with true aneurysms had higher rates of overall late complications, including late stroke. Patients treated with covered stents had a significant decrease in overall late complications. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H391682796\"><span class=\"h2\">Graft/stent specific complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Like carotid endarterectomy, graft or patch thrombosis is a significant early complication that mandates an intervention, whereas late thrombosis is often asymptomatic and can be managed nonoperatively. One study reported a five-year primary patency for synthetic grafts at 89 percent compared with 66 percent for vein grafts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. They attributed the high postoperative stroke rate (three out of five patients) with vein grafts to kinking of the graft. </p><p>Although endovascular repair confers some benefits over open repair, unique device-related complications such as endoleak and stent graft occlusion can occur. In addition, the placement of a stent graft does not necessarily relieve the mass effect and compressive symptoms caused by a larger aneurysm. </p><p>In a systematic review that included 224 patients, the leading in-hospital complication with endovascular repair was endoleak, occurring in 8.1 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. After a mean follow-up period of 15 months, the rate of late complication was 11.7 percent, with the most frequent complication being stent-graft occlusion at 6.3 percent. Late reintervention rates and surgical conversion were 4.7 and 2.4 percent, respectively. Additionally, stent migration and fracture with stenosis, persistent endoleak, late stroke, and carotid artery rupture were all reported. Compared with patients with pseudoaneurysms, patients with true aneurysms had higher rates of overall late complications, including stent-graft migration and late stroke. A subgroup analysis of covered versus bare metal stents had similar procedural success rates. However, patients treated with covered stents had a significant decrease in reinterventions and in overall late complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/extracranial-carotid-artery-aneurysm/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H596910622\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extracranial carotid artery aneurysms are uncommon and occur in a broad range of patients due to many etiologies. Extracranial carotid aneurysms (true or false) have been classified according to affected anatomic segment, which is important for determining a treatment approach. The internal carotid artery is the most commonly involved segment. (See <a href=\"#H43534096\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy and classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The factors leading to true aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm differ. The most common etiology of true extracranial carotid artery aneurysm is atherosclerosis. Pseudoaneurysm is often a consequence of carotid trauma or dissection, or related to a prior carotid endarterectomy site. Factors that predispose to carotid artery aneurysm include those that increase the risk for atherosclerosis, primary or secondary carotid artery infection, cerebrovascular injury (trauma or dissection), and carotid artery irradiation. A variety of other pathologies that are known to weaken the integrity of the arterial wall are also associated with carotid artery aneurysm. (See <a href=\"#H28431629\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A diagnosis of extracranial carotid artery aneurysm may be suspected based upon symptoms related to embolization of thrombus lining the aneurysm sac, local compression of surrounding structures from mass effects, or, rarely, aneurysm rupture. The most common symptomatic presentation is transient ischemic attack, or stroke. In many patients with extracranial carotid artery aneurysm, a pulsatile neck mass can be palpated below the angle of the mandible. (See <a href=\"#H28431701\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A diagnosis of extracranial carotid artery aneurysm relies upon the demonstration of the aneurysm on imaging studies. Ultrasound is the initial imaging study to evaluate most neck masses, but advanced imaging (computed tomography [CT] angiography, magnetic resonance [MR] angiography) is usually needed to further define the aneurysm and confirm a suspected etiology. Brain imaging (CT or MR) should be routinely obtained to assess the intracerebral perfusion as well as identify any previous infarcts. (See <a href=\"#H596910616\" class=\"local\">'Carotid imaging'</a> above and <a href=\"#H391685498\" class=\"local\">'Further evaluation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other evaluation includes screening for other aneurysms in those with true extracranial carotid artery aneurysms, and for patients in whom a predisposing heritable condition is suspected, further investigation should include family history, pathology consultation, and imaging of other affected arterial beds, and possibly genetic testing and counseling. (See <a href=\"#H391685498\" class=\"local\">'Further evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The natural history of asymptomatic extracranial carotid artery aneurysm is uncertain but may be one of continued expansion, which eventually can lead to symptoms. Patients with symptomatic extracranial carotid artery aneurysms should undergo repair. We also repair asymptomatic aneurysms that are large (&gt;2 cm), those with intraluminal thrombus (regardless of symptoms), and small, asymptomatic aneurysms that demonstrate expansion on serial imaging. (See <a href=\"#H28431758\" class=\"local\">'Natural history and management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The approach to repair is individualized based upon aneurysm etiology and location (proximal and distal extent of the aneurysm), patient comorbidities, and available surgical and endovascular expertise and resources. (See <a href=\"#H596911945\" class=\"local\">'Indications for and approach to repair'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Options for open surgical repair include carotid artery ligation with or without bypass, and aneurysm excision and carotid reconstruction. Features favoring an open approach include true aneurysm, infected primary aneurysm, and pseudoaneurysm due to carotid patch disruption. (See <a href=\"#H596911824\" class=\"local\">'Open surgical repair'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Options for endovascular repair include bare metal stent placement with or without trans-stent coil embolization of the aneurysm sac, exclusion of the aneurysm using a stent-graft, or endovascular occlusion of the carotid artery. Features favoring an endovascular approach include pseudoaneurysm related to trauma, aneurysm of the distal internal carotid artery, and hostile neck anatomy. (See <a href=\"#H596911864\" class=\"local\">'Endovascular repair'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perioperative mortality is similar for open and endovascular repair of extracranial carotid artery aneurysm. Complications include cranial nerve injury with open repair, stroke (perioperative and late), and <span class=\"nowrap\">graft-/stent-specific</span> complications.
