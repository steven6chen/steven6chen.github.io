Etonogestrel is slowly released over at least three years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F85783\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef85783 \">figure 3</a>), initially at 60 to 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day,</span> decreasing to 35 to 45 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span> at the end of the first year, to 30 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span> at the end of the second year, and then to 25 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/day</span> at the end of the third year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etonogestrel-contraceptive-implant/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Data from a prospective study indicate the mean etonogestrel serum concentration is maintained at a level to provide contraception at least through the fifth year of implant use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etonogestrel-contraceptive-implant/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Unlike Implanon, the Nexplanon rod is radio-opaque so it can be detected by x-ray and thus does not require magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for locating an impalpable implant. In addition, the redesigned applicator makes subdermal insertion easier and failed insertion unlikely because the new cap will not open if the implant is not in the needle and a finger pressure activated lever ensures that the trocar completely discharges the contraceptive implant under the skin. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2346895\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM FOR CONTRACEPTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Progestins cause changes in cervical mucus and tubal motility that are unfavorable to sperm migration, thus inhibiting fertilization. At high doses, progestins also inhibit gonadotropin secretion, thereby inhibiting follicular maturation and ovulation. This dual effect allows contraceptive efficacy to be maintained even though ovulation is not consistently inhibited in implant users toward the end of the three-year period of use. Although progestins suppress endometrial activity, which makes the endometrium unreceptive to implantation, this is less important since the major mechanisms of contraceptive action prevent fertilization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1435250704\"><span class=\"h1\">DURATION OF ACTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on initial trial data, the United States prescribing information for the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etonogestrel-implant-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etonogestrel implant</a> states that the implant should be removed after three years of use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etonogestrel-contraceptive-implant/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Subsequent studies suggest the device is effective beyond three years of use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etonogestrel-contraceptive-implant/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].

While the side effects between the implant groups were similar, women with the etonogestrel implant reported higher rates of subjective heavy menstrual bleeding, although the overall frequency was low (12 versus 9 percent for etonogestrel and levonorgestrel implants). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H323449076\"><span class=\"h1\">CANDIDATES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women are candidates for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etonogestrel-implant-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etonogestrel implant</a> contraception; there are few medical disorders where the risk of the method exceeds the benefit (eg, current breast cancer).

Subsequently published data support this conclusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etonogestrel-contraceptive-implant/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>This recommendation differs from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etonogestrel-implant-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etonogestrel implant</a> package labeling, which lists current or past thrombosis as a contraindication to use. Etonogestrel is the synthetic biologically active metabolite of the synthetic progestin desogestrel. Controversy remains as to whether desogestrel or its derivatives may be associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism compared with other progestins. Evidence of this increased risk comes from studies of oral contraceptives where desogestrel is administered in combination with ethinyl estradiol, rather than alone as in the implant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etonogestrel-contraceptive-implant/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFICACY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16205996\"><span class=\"h2\">General population</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etonogestrel-implant-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etonogestrel implant</a> is among the most effective contraceptives available (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70218\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70218 \">table 1</a>), as good or better than sterilization procedures. An analysis of 11 clinical trials in which 942 women enrolled for two to four years showed the etonogestrel implant was well-tolerated and effective: no pregnancies occurred while women were using this method of contraception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etonogestrel-contraceptive-implant/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Six pregnancies have been reported during the first 14 days after implant removal. The manufacturer cites a Pearl Index of 0.38 pregnancies per 100 women-years of use, which is similar to that of other long-acting methods of contraception. Pregnancy may be intrauterine or extrauterine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etonogestrel-contraceptive-implant/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The etonogestrel implant is approved for only three years of use, but a World Health Organization randomized trial documents that it is as least as effective as the copper IUD and the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a> implants for up to five years of use, for which those are approved in many countries, including the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etonogestrel-contraceptive-implant/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3122095782\"><span class=\"h2\">Women at high risk of unintended pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women at high risk of unintended pregnancy, including adolescents and patients undergoing induced abortion, are excellent candidates for the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etonogestrel-implant-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etonogestrel implant</a> because of the increased risk of discontinuation of other methods in these populations. In a secondary analysis including over 6100 sexually active patients aged 14 years and older, patients younger than 20 years preferred long-acting contraceptives and were highly likely to continue using the etonogestrel implant 12 months after insertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etonogestrel-contraceptive-implant/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].&nbsp;The etonogestrel implant is also successfully used by women undergoing an induced abortion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etonogestrel-contraceptive-implant/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16205961\"><span class=\"h2\">Overweight and obese women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etonogestrel-implant-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etonogestrel implant</a> is not contraindicated in obese women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etonogestrel-contraceptive-implant/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Both implants appeared to be correctly positioned and there was no obvious reason for the contraceptive failures other than a possible decrease of etonogestrel efficacy related to administration of hepatic enzyme-inducing antiretroviral medications. One pharmacokinetic study of the etonogestrel implant in women on antiretroviral medications reported substantial decreases in the bioavailability of etonogestrel in women on an efavirenz-containing regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etonogestrel-contraceptive-implant/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In addition, the study also reported that women on a lopinavir-containing regimen had increased bioavailability of etonogestrel. Although it is not currently possible to assess the magnitude of the risk of contraceptive failure in this setting, prospective users should be informed about the possibility of increased failure rates when taking efavirenz-containing regimens. This risk does not preclude use of the implant, which remains highly effective for most women on antiretroviral drugs. For HIV-infected women who are using condoms to protect against transmission of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, the condoms will provide additional contraceptive benefit.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antiseizure drugs &ndash; Enzyme-inducing antiseizure drugs appear to lower etonogestrel levels.

Of note, the number of ovarian follicle-like structures and endometrial thickness did not change; the three week study-period did not assess unintended pregnancy as an outcome measure. This small study supports prior case reports of women who conceived while using the etonogestrel implant and carbamazepine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etonogestrel-contraceptive-implant/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. As etonogestrel contraceptive efficacy may be reduced in women using antiseizure medication, both the World Health Organization (WHO) and US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use advise intrauterine devices (either copper or progestin-releasing) as the preferred methods for women who desire long-acting reversible contraception and are taking an antiepileptic agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etonogestrel-contraceptive-implant/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SIDE EFFECTS AND ADVERSE EVENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unscheduled bleeding is a common side effect, which may or may not decrease with continued use. In the analysis of 11 clinical trials described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etonogestrel-contraceptive-implant/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], unscheduled bleeding was the primary reason for discontinuation, with a rate of 14.8 percent in the United States and Europe, but only 3.7 percent in Southeast Asia, Chile, and Russia. United States users were more likely to discontinue because of prolonged or heavy bleeding than women from other countries (7.0 versus 4.3 percent). The mean number of bleeding and spotting days per 90-day reference period was 7.3 and 10.4 days, respectively. One third of 90-day reference periods had fewer than three <span class=\"nowrap\">bleeding/spotting</span> episodes; one fifth had no <span class=\"nowrap\">bleeding/spotting</span> (amenorrhea); 17 percent had a bleeding episode that lasted more than 14 days, and 6 percent had more than five <span class=\"nowrap\">bleeding/spotting</span> episodes. The number of unscheduled bleeding days was highest in the first three months of use, decreased during the first year of use, and then plateaued for the second and third years of use. However, this decrease may have resulted from patients discontinuing as a result of a bleeding irregularity, leaving for analysis those less likely to experience bleeding. </p><p>Women who experienced more days of bleeding were more likely to discontinue, especially if the bleeding was prolonged. For example, the mean number of <span class=\"nowrap\">bleeding/spotting</span> days in women who discontinued and who continued implant use during a 90-day reference period was 45.2 and 16.5 days, respectively. Frequent or prolonged <span class=\"nowrap\">bleeding/spotting</span> was reported in about 90 percent of women who discontinued the implant but in only 22 percent of those who continued its use. </p><p>Treatment of unscheduled bleeding is not necessary, but since bleeding disturbances are the principal cause of discontinuation, several approaches to their treatment have been used, including short-term use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), combined oral contraceptive pills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etonogestrel-contraceptive-implant/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], or supplemental estrogen. Management of unacceptable bleeding patterns is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-unscheduled-bleeding-in-women-using-contraception#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of unscheduled bleeding in women using contraception&quot;, section on 'Progestin-releasing implants'</a>.)</p><p>The most common adverse events besides unscheduled bleeding that were deemed possibly, probably, or definitely related to the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etonogestrel-implant-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etonogestrel implant</a> included headache (16 percent), weight gain (12 percent), acne (12 percent), breast tenderness (10 percent), emotional lability (6 percent) and abdominal pain (5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etonogestrel-contraceptive-implant/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etonogestrel-implant-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etonogestrel implant</a> does not induce significant bone loss, despite creation of a relatively hypoestrogenic state. In contrast, depot <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> (DMPA), another progestin-only contraceptive that reduces estrogen levels, can decrease bone mineral density. </p><p>In a prospective cohort study of healthy women who received etonogestrel implants, reduced levels of insulin, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance scores, quantitative insulin sensitivity check index, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein were reported for the 21 women followed for three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etonogestrel-contraceptive-implant/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Although the reductions were statistically significant, the clinical significance of these changes is not known.

Women who are postabortion or postpartum (even if breastfeeding) can have the implant inserted immediately after termination of pregnancy or delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etonogestrel-contraceptive-implant/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Immediate placement has been found to be cost-effective when compared with delayed insertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etonogestrel-contraceptive-implant/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].

This is a conservative approach because changes in cervical mucus occur rapidly and are probably complete within 36 hours of insertion. Options for back-up contraception include use of condoms or continued use of the woman&rsquo;s previous method of contraception. For women who are postpartum, not exclusively breastfeeding, and have not resumed menses, back-up contraception is suggested for those who are &ge;21 days postpartum. For women who are postpartum, exclusively breastfeeding, and have not resumed menses, back-up contraception is suggested for those who are &gt;6 months postpartum. For women who are postabortion, back-up contraception is suggested if the implant is not placed on the day of the abortion. </p><p>If the woman has been using an intrauterine device (IUD) and is switching to the implant, she may have residual sperm in her reproductive tract, which could result in fertilization and implantation if the IUD is removed.

The manufacturer suggests positioning the upper inner aspect of her nondominant arm by bending her elbow 90 degrees and rotating her arm upward and outward so that her hand is opposite her head (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F68831\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68831 \">figure 5</a>). The planned insertion site is noted or marked after measuring 8 to 10 cm (3 to 4 inches) from the medial epicondyle of the humerus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etonogestrel-contraceptive-implant/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Some clinicians mark the skin to help guide insertion. One mark is made where the rod will be inserted and a second mark is made a few centimeters proximal to the first mark to serve as a direction guide during insertion. However, insertion directly through the marked skin should be avoided as it can result in &quot;tattooing.&quot; We do not find skin marks helpful.</p><p>The optimum site depends upon individual anatomic features, such as the length of the upper arm (avoid placing the end of the implant too near the axilla) and the area where the crease between the biceps and triceps muscles is clearest. Once the insertion site has been identified, we place a sterile drape under the arm and clean the insertion site with an antiseptic solution.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Administer anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inject 1 to 2 mL of 1 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloroprocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloroprocaine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> into the dermis to raise a wheal along the planned track of the rod insertion needle. Inject the local anesthetic just under the skin with a 25-gauge, 1.5-inch needle on a 2 to 5 mL syringe.</p><p>A burning sensation is common during injection of the local anesthetic. This effect can be eliminated for most patients by adding 1 meq of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> to each 10 mL of anesthetic (however, this buffering shortens shelf life to 24 hours).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Insert</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The operator should be seated and should view the insertion site from the side, not from above the device. As noted above (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Position the patient'</a> above), the planned insertion site should be 8 to 10 cm (3 to 4 inches) above the medial epicondyle of the non-dominant arm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etonogestrel-contraceptive-implant/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The implant is inserted subdermally (ie, just under the skin). Care is taken to avoid insertion into the sulcus between the biceps and triceps muscles that contains a large neurovascular bundle. </p><p>As the sharp, beveled trocar easily penetrates the skin, a separate incision is not necessary. The clinician grasps the applicator above the needle cap on its textured surface between thumb and forefinger and removes the clear plastic needle cover. Next, the clinician places the needle against the insertion site holding the applicator at an angle 30 degrees to the skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F55935\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55935 \">figure 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F77440\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef77440 \">movie 1</a>). While applying counter traction to the skin around the insertion site, the clinician punctures the skin with the needle tip. The clinician then lowers the applicator so that it is parallel to the skin and advances the needle in the subdermal connective tissue while lifting the skin with the tip of the needle. The needle is advanced to its full length. If the needle is not fully advanced under the skin, the implant will not be correctly inserted. Lastly, the slider is unlocked with downward finger pressure on the lever, and then the clinician moves the slider fully backward (distally) and removes the applicator.</p><p>Most women feel no more than a pressure sensation during the insertion procedure. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Verify placement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immediately after insertion, palpate the skin to verify correct placement of the rod; both ends should be palpable. Ask the patient to feel her implant, then place an adhesive closure on the insertion puncture and wrap the site with a pressure bandage. If you cannot feel the implant, check the applicator to make sure the implant is no longer in the applicator. The applicator obturator is purple, while the implant is white. If there is doubt about the presence of the implant, use sonography or an x-ray to determine its presence. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Post insertion care and follow-up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complete the Patient Chart Label for the patient's medical record and the User Card, which must be given to the patient. This information is useful for other health care providers who may be called upon to remove the implant.</p><p>Most women do not experience pain after insertion, but if it occurs, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents usually provide relief.</p><p>The patient may be discharged immediately after the procedure. A routine follow-up visit is not necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etonogestrel-contraceptive-implant/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. She should call the provider if she develops pain, discharge, or swelling at the insertion site, fever, or other concerns. She should also contact her provider if she has a change in her health status, or when she wants to switch contraception methods, remove the implant to attempt pregnancy, or replace the implant (three years after insertion). &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications related to insertion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications are rare, reported in 0.3 to 1 percent of insertions and 0.2 to 1.7 percent of removals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etonogestrel-contraceptive-implant/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Potential complications include infection, hematoma formation, local irritation or rash, expulsion, and allergic reactions. The implant may migrate a short distance (less than 2 cm) over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etonogestrel-contraceptive-implant/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The incidence of complications is minimized by clinician training and experience, and the use of strict aseptic technique.</p><p>A single case of injury to branches of the medial antebrachial cutaneous nerve during Implanon insertion has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etonogestrel-contraceptive-implant/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Nerve injury can result in impaired sensibility, severe localized pain, or the formation of painful neuroma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">REMOVAL AND RETURN OF OVULATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rod can be removed at any time, but should be removed at the end of three years (per package insert). The hormonal effects end promptly after removal; circulating levels of etonogestrel are undetectable in one week and more than 90 percent of women ovulate within three to four weeks of removal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F60519\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60519 \">figure 7</a>). If the implant is not removed, contraceptive effects persist, possibly for as long as two years.</p><p>Implant removal is an office procedure requiring only local anesthesia. Equipment is the same as that listed above for insertion (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Insertion'</a> above), except the Nexplanon applicator is replaced by sterile mosquito forceps (curved and straight) and a #11 scalpel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71918\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71918 \">figure 8</a>). For removing deeply inserted implants, a modified (&lt;2 mm diameter) vasectomy forceps can be useful for grasping a deeply placed implant away from its end (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F59134\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59134 \">figure 9</a>). Removal takes about four minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etonogestrel-contraceptive-implant/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>We recommend viewing an instructional video and then practicing removal on a model arm before attempting the procedure on a patient. A removal kit containing a model arm and a manual and compact disc illustrating basic technique is available from the manufacturer. </p><p>The patient should read and sign an informed consent, which is filed in her medical record. We suggest that the patient also be given a copy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Position the patient and prepare the implant site as described above for rod insertion (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Position the patient'</a> above). We prefer to have the patient extend her arm for the insertion procedure but bend her arm for implant removal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F58638\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58638 \">figure 10</a>).</p><p>Palpate the distal tip of the rod (the end closest to the elbow). If it is not palpable, then removal should be postponed until the rod can be localized with sonography or x-ray imaging (see <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Difficult removals'</a> below).</p><p>Push down on the proximal end of the rod (the end closest to the axilla) and inject no more than 0.5 mL of buffered <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> into the dermis immediately under the elevated distal tip of the rod, raising a wheal about 5 mm in diameter. Too much anesthetic makes it difficult to locate the rod. Massage this area to disperse the anesthetic.</p><p>Use your fingers to again apply pressure on the proximal (axillary) end of the rod so that the distal (elbow) end pushes up against the skin. As the rod is pushed against the skin, the blade of a #11 scalpel is positioned so that the point is immediately available to incise the sheath without releasing pressure on the rod. It is best to keep the scalpel in one hand with thumb and index finger while manipulating the rod with the rest of the fingers of both hands. Pushing the rod against the incision with finger pressure is critical for success with this &quot;Pop Out&quot; technique. If pressure is released, the rod will slip back into the fibrous sheath in the subdermal tissue.</p><p>Make a 2 to 3 mm longitudinal incision through the skin over the end of the rod. Deepen the incision until you feel a rubbery sensation against the point of the scalpel blade; this is the rod encased in a fibrous sheath. Nick the fibrous sheath covering the end of the rod with the tip of the scalpel blade. It may take several nicks in different directions to fully open the sheath.</p><p>The end of the rod will come into view as the sheath is opened. Continue to exert finger pressure on the proximal (axillary) end of the rod to push the distal (elbow) end through the incision until it can be grasped with mosquito forceps or fingers and pulled out. Confirm that all 40 mm of the rod have been removed. </p><p>Close the incision with an adhesive strip (eg, butterfly bandage) and cover with a pressure bandage to minimize bruising.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Difficult removals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the rod will not move toward the incision with finger pressure, it can be grasped with a hemostat or modified vasectomy forceps (filed down to a 2 mm diameter grasping ring) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F59134\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59134 \">figure 9</a>), but the incision will usually have to be lengthened in order to admit the clamp. It may be necessary to inject more local anesthetic, and to dissect around the rod with a straight mosquito clamp. The disadvantage of instrument removal is that it can be more painful, cause more bleeding, require a larger incision, and increase the risk of breaking the rod.</p><p>Once a rod is damaged, it can fracture with further attempts to grasp it with clamps. To decrease this risk, the rod should be grasped by its end whenever possible and with as little traction as possible for exposure and removal.</p><p>If it is not possible to grasp and push up on the end of a deeply implanted rod to open the fibrous sheath, use a scalpel to cut longitudinally, not across, the sheath covering the rod. Rarely, removal of a cut or broken rod will require an additional incision at the proximal end of the rod so that the remaining piece can be removed. When the rod must be grasped around its diameter, rather than at the end, the vasectomy forceps are particularly useful.</p><p>Rods too deeply placed cannot be palpated under the skin, but can be seen with imaging studies (Implanon can be identified with high resolution sonography or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]; Nexplanon can be identified with high resolution sonography, plain X-ray, computed tomography, or MRI). Such &quot;lost&quot; rods should be located with a high frequency (10 to 15 megahertz), short focus, linear ultrasound transducer prior to attempting the removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etonogestrel-contraceptive-implant/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>]. Use a transverse orientation to identify an acoustic shadow (the rod itself is more difficult to see), measure the depth, and draw a line representing the rod location on the surface of the skin. A thin wire (eg, an opened paper clip), held under the transducer may be used to help mark the skin surface in relation to the impalpable rod. If the rod is very deep (&gt;1.5 to 2 cm), sonography should be used during the removal procedure because movement of the patient's arm may change the location of skin marks in relation to the underlying implant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etonogestrel-contraceptive-implant/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>Patients with &quot;very&quot; (&gt;2 cm) deep (as determined sonographically) implants should be referred to an experienced gynecologist, eg, at one of the &quot;Family Planning Fellowship&quot; training sites at major medical schools around the country (<a href=\"http://www.familyplanningfellowship.org/&amp;token=YMO2sapP92L8DjnwAnkws1CVa8cUu222OYyfLZpasv6XBAmI9fYCDnfeTvGCbe4OrwC1JCwUsNIWoeWxLU0oqw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=3266\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.familyplanningfellowship.org</a>). The contraceptive specialist can then work with interventional radiologists to remove the implant under direct imaging and controlled conditions. Removal of contraceptive implants is <strong>never</strong> an emergency; there is no evidence that their presence adversely affects pregnancies or other conditions. Therefore, we suggest waiting until removal can be performed by a surgeon with expertise in removal of difficult contraceptive implants. Consultation with an orthopedic or plastic surgeon without specific expertise managing this problem is rarely required. A list of &quot;Centers of Experience&quot; in removing deeply placed and nonpalpable implants is available from the manufacturer if referral for removal is necessary. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">REINSERTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the patient wants to continue to use implant contraception, a new rod can be inserted immediately through the same incision that was used to remove the old rod.
