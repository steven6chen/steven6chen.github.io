This study used clinical electronic health record (EHR) data (and the sepsis definitions described above (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Sepsis'</a> below)) from 7 million hospitalizations in 409 US hospitals and compared it to traditional claims-based analysis (<em>International Classification of diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes </em>for severe sepsis or septic shock) and direct chart review. It was estimated that using EHR-based data, admission rates due to sepsis remained unchanged over the study period at 6 percent while in-hospital mortality decreased by 3 percent. In contrast, claims-based analyses suggested a 10 percent increase in incidence and a 7 percent reduction in mortality. When compared with direct chart review (thought to be the most sensitive method of detecting incidence) of 510 randomly selected cases, it was estimated that EHR-based analyses missed 20 percent of sepsis cases, while claims-based analysis missed 40 percent. A meta-analysis of 10 studies that did not include this major trial also reported that qSOFA was superior to SIRS for the diagnosis of sepsis but qSOFA was a better predictor of in-hospital mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sepsis-syndromes-in-adults-epidemiology-definitions-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-prognosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p/><p>Reasons for a possible increased rate of sepsis include advancing age, immunosuppression, and multidrug-resistant infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sepsis-syndromes-in-adults-epidemiology-definitions-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-prognosis/abstract/4,10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10-13</a>].

Gram positive bacteria are most frequently identified in patients with sepsis in the United States, although the number of cases of Gram negative sepsis remains substantial.

In approximately half of cases of sepsis, an organism is not identified (culture negative sepsis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sepsis-syndromes-in-adults-epidemiology-definitions-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-prognosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1626046055\"><span class=\"h2\">Disease severity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The severity of disease appears to be increasing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sepsis-syndromes-in-adults-epidemiology-definitions-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-prognosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In one retrospective analysis, the proportion of patients with sepsis who also had at least one dysfunctional organ increased from 26 to 44 percent between 1993 and 2003 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sepsis-syndromes-in-adults-epidemiology-definitions-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-prognosis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. The most common manifestations of severe organ dysfunction were acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sepsis-syndromes-in-adults-epidemiology-definitions-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-prognosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, it is unclear as to whether the rising incidence of sepsis and septic shock reflects the overall increased incidence of sepsis or altered definitions of sepsis over time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sepsis exists on a continuum of severity ranging from infection and bacteremia to sepsis and septic shock, which can lead to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and death. The definitions of sepsis and septic shock have rapidly evolved since the early 1990s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sepsis-syndromes-in-adults-epidemiology-definitions-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-prognosis/abstract/25-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-30</a>]. The systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is no longer included in the definition since it is not always caused by infection. The definitions for sepsis that we provide below reflect expert opinion from task forces generated by national societies including the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM). Importantly, such definitions are <strong>not</strong> diagnostic of sepsis since they do not comprehensively include specific criteria for the identification of infection. However, clinicians should be aware that <span class=\"nowrap\">SCCM/ESICM</span> definitions are not unanimously accepted. For example, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) still continues to support the previous definition of SIRS, sepsis, and severe sepsis.

However, there is no formal definition of early sepsis.

The 2016 <span class=\"nowrap\">SCCM/ESICM</span> task force have described an assessment score for patients outside the intensive care unit as a way to facilitate the identification of patients potentially at risk of dying from sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sepsis-syndromes-in-adults-epidemiology-definitions-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-prognosis/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. This score is a modified version of the Sequential (Sepsis-related) Organ Failure Assessment score (SOFA) called the quickSOFA (qSOFA) score (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-sequential-organ-failure-assessment-quick-qsofa-score-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). A score &ge;2 is associated with poor outcomes due to sepsis.</p><p>The qSOFA score is easy to calculate since it only has three components, each of which are readily identifiable at the bedside and are allocated one point:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory rate <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;22/minute</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Altered mentation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systolic blood pressure &le;100 mmHg</p><p/><p>Because data of the value of qSOFA is conflicting, we believe that further studies that demonstrate improved clinically meaningful outcomes due to the use of qSOFA compared to clinical judgement are warranted before it can be routinely used to predict those at risk of death from sepsis. The qSOFA score was originally validated in 2016 as most useful in patients suspected as having sepsis <strong>outside</strong> of the intensive care unit (ICU) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sepsis-syndromes-in-adults-epidemiology-definitions-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-prognosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. It has since been prospectively studied in several settings including the emergency department (ED) and ICU with conflicting data regarding its ability to accurately predict the risk of death in these populations. In addition, its comparative performance with other predictors of mortality such as systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria (SIRS) is also conflicting. On balance, qSOFA may not be as robust as originally thought and clinicians need to keep in mind that it was originally designed not as a diagnostic tool but rather as a predictive tool that calculates the risk of death from sepsis. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>ED</strong> &ndash; Among 879 patients presenting to the ED with suspected infection, the predictive validity of qSOFA for in hospital mortality was similar to that of the full SOFA score (3 percent mortality for qSOFA and SOFA scores less than 2 versus 24 and 18 percent mortality for qSOFA and SOFA scores greater than or equal to 2, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sepsis-syndromes-in-adults-epidemiology-definitions-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-prognosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In addition, qSOFA was superior to the systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria (SIRS) (area under the receiver operating curve [AUROC], 0.80 versus 0.65) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sepsis-syndromes-in-adults-epidemiology-definitions-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-prognosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Limitations of this analysis include a high percentage of missing values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sepsis-syndromes-in-adults-epidemiology-definitions-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-prognosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In contrast, other retrospective studies of ED patients report limited value of the qSOFA score with one study reporting that qSOFA was inferior to SIRS for the identification of sepsis since it took longer to document (84 versus 47 minutes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sepsis-syndromes-in-adults-epidemiology-definitions-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-prognosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>] and another reporting low diagnostic performance of qSOFA for predicting 28-day mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sepsis-syndromes-in-adults-epidemiology-definitions-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-prognosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Another study reported that other early identification scores including the modified early warning score (MEWS), the national early warning score (NEWS), and SIRS outperformed qSOFA for predicting death and ICU transfer in non-ICU patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sepsis-syndromes-in-adults-epidemiology-definitions-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-prognosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>ED plus ICU</strong> &ndash; In a 2018 meta-analysis of 38 studies that included patients from the ED, wards, and ICU, compared with SIRS criteria, qSOFA was poorly sensitive (61 versus 88 percent) but had a higher specificity (26 versus 72 percent) for predicting mortality from sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sepsis-syndromes-in-adults-epidemiology-definitions-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-prognosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The sensitivity of qSOFA was higher and the specificity lower in the ICU population compared with non-ICU population (87 versus 51 percent; 33 versus 80 percent). However, limitations of this analysis include the heterogeneous nature of the populations studied and differences in the timing of the measurement of mortality.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>ICU</strong> &ndash; A retrospective analysis of 184,875 ICU patients with an infection-related diagnosis reported that qSOFA was inferior to SOFA in predicting in hospital mortality (AUROC, 0.75 versus 0.60) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sepsis-syndromes-in-adults-epidemiology-definitions-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-prognosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]Limitations of this analysis include poor generalizability to all ICUs. </p><p/><p>The full SOFA score is described separately.

The validity of this score was derived from critically-ill patients with suspected sepsis by interrogating over a million intensive care unit (ICU) electronic health record encounters from ICUs both inside and outside the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sepsis-syndromes-in-adults-epidemiology-definitions-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-prognosis/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. ICU patients were suspected as having infection if body fluids were cultured and they received antibiotics. Predictive scores (SOFA, systemic inflammatory response syndrome [SIRS], and logistic Organ Dysfunction System [LODS]) were compared for their ability to predict mortality. Among critically ill patients with suspected sepsis, the predictive validity of the SOFA score for in-hospital mortality was superior to that for the SIRS criteria (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.74 versus 0.64). Patients who fulfill these criteria have a predicted mortality of &ge;10 percent. Although the predictive capacity of SOFA and LODS were similar, SOFA is considered easier to calculate, and was therefore recommended by the task force. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Importantly, the SOFA score is an organ dysfunction score. It is not diagnostic of sepsis nor does it identify those whose organ dysfunction is truly due to infection but rather helps identify patients who potentially have a high risk of dying from infection. In addition, it does not determine individual treatment strategies nor does it predict mortality based upon demographics (eg, age) or underlying condition (eg, stem cell transplant recipient versus postoperative patient). SOFA and other predictive scores are discussed separately.

In our experience, for this component of the diagnosis, the clinician is reliant upon clinical suspicion derived from the signs and symptoms of infection as well as supporting radiologic and microbiologic data and response to therapy. (See <a href=\"#H1227723412\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2598431963\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The term severe sepsis, which originally referred to sepsis that was associated with tissue hypoperfusion (eg, elevated lactate, oliguria) or organ dysfunction (eg, elevated creatinine, coagulopathy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sepsis-syndromes-in-adults-epidemiology-definitions-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-prognosis/abstract/26,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,37</a>], and the term systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79464\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79464 \">table 1</a>)) are no longer used since the 2016 sepsis and septic shock definitions include patients with evidence of tissue hypoperfusion and organ dysfunction.

Global rates of sepsis are as high as 437 per 100,000 person-years and sepsis appears to be responsible for 6 percent of US hospital admissions. Gram positive bacteria are the pathogens that are most commonly isolated from patients with sepsis.

A 2016 task force from the Society of Critical Care Medicine and European Society of Intensive Care Medicine <span class=\"nowrap\">(SCCM/ESICM)</span> define sepsis and septic shock as the following (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sepsis is defined as life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection; organ dysfunction is defined as an increase of two or more points in the sequential (sepsis-related) organ failure assessment (SOFA) score (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-sequential-organ-failure-assessment-sofa-score-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Septic shock is defined as sepsis that has circulatory, cellular, and metabolic abnormalities that are associated with a greater risk of mortality than sepsis alone; these abnormalities can be clinically identified as patients who fulfill the criteria for sepsis who, despite adequate fluid resuscitation, require vasopressors to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) &ge;65 mmHg and have a lactate &gt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> (&gt;18 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, clinicians should be aware that <span class=\"nowrap\">SCCM/ESICM</span> definitions are not unanimously accepted. For example, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) still continues to support the previous definition of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79464\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79464 \">table 1</a>)), sepsis, and severe sepsis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors for sepsis include intensive care unit (ICU) admission, a nosocomial infection, bacteremia, advanced age, immunosuppression, previous hospitalization (in particular hospitalization associated with infection), and community-acquired pneumonia. Genetic defects have also been identified that may increase susceptibility to specific classes of microorganisms. (See <a href=\"#H2684148015\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with suspected or documented sepsis typically present with hypotension, tachycardia, fever, and leukocytosis. As severity worsens, signs of shock (eg, cool skin and cyanosis) and organ dysfunction develop (eg, oliguria, acute kidney injury, altered mental status) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sepsis-syndromes-in-adults-epidemiology-definitions-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-prognosis/abstract/26,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,37</a>]. Importantly, the presentation is nonspecific such that many other conditions (eg, pancreatitis, acute respiratory distress syndrome) may present similarly. (See <a href=\"#H1227723412\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A constellation of clinical, laboratory, radiologic, physiologic, and microbiologic data is typically required for the diagnosis of sepsis and septic shock. The diagnosis is often made empirically at the bedside upon presentation, or retrospectively when follow-up data return or a response to antibiotics is evident. Importantly, the identification of a culprit organism, although preferred, is not always feasible since many patients have been partially treated with antibiotics before cultures are obtained. (See <a href=\"#H2598431963\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sepsis has a high mortality rate that appears to be decreasing. Estimates range from 10 to 52 percent with rates increasing linearly according to the disease severity of sepsis. Following discharge from the hospital, sepsis carries an increased risk of death as well as an increased risk of further sepsis and recurrent hospital admissions. Poor prognostic factors include the inability to mount a fever, leukopenia, age &gt;40 years, certain comorbidities (eg, AIDS, hepatic failure, cirrhosis, cancer, alcohol dependence, immunosuppression), a non-urinary source of infection, a nosocomial source of infection, and inappropriate or late antibiotic coverage.
