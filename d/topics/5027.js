Normal motor function requires the coordination of neurologic, physiologic, and biologic processes including proprioception, vestibular integration, strength, balance, coordination, dexterity, visual-motor ability, and visual ability. Individual and environmental factors, such as motivation, perseverance, opportunity for practice, and encouragement, also play a role. Problems in any of these areas can result in deficits in motor skills, or clumsiness.</p><p>Developmental coordination disorder (DCD) is characterized by problems with motor coordination that interfere with academic performance and social integration in otherwise healthy children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. These motor problems typically present in the early school years with difficulty performing simple motor tasks (eg, running, buttoning, or using scissors) and usually persist into adolescence and adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p>This topic review will discuss the etiology, clinical features, evaluation and diagnosis of DCD.

Most reviews suggest that the prevalence among school-age children is approximately 6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,3,11-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,11-16</a>]. However, in a cohort study with stringent criteria (including significant impact on activities of daily living), the prevalence was 1.7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>DCD is two to seven times more common in boys than girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,17</a>]. The prevalence is not affected by socioeconomic status or educational level.</p><p>Childhood DCD is strongly related to a history of preterm birth and low birth weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. In a 2011 systematic review, the risk of DCD was higher in children born at &lt;32 weeks and those with very low birth weight (&lt;1500 g) than in <span class=\"nowrap\">full-term/normal</span> birth weight children (odds ratio [OR] 6.3, 95% CI 4.4-9.0) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. A subsequent cohort study confirmed the increased risk of DCD among premature and small for gestational age infants (OR 6.3 for infants born at 23 to 31.1 weeks; OR 2.1 for infants born at 32 to 36.6 weeks; and OR 1.7 for infants born small for gestational age) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=caffeine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Caffeine</a> therapy for apnea of prematurity during the neonatal period appears to reduce the risk of DCD in preterm infants.

Insights into the etiology of a particular child's motor problems may aid in tailoring the appropriate treatment strategy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=developmental-coordination-disorder-management-and-outcome#H7496967\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Developmental coordination disorder: Management and outcome&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p>Approximately 50 percent of children with DCD are left-handed or ambidextrous, compared with 10 percent of the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. This suggests that incomplete lateralization may play a role in DCD.</p><p>Neuroimaging, principally in the form of functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging, supports the hypothesis that children with DCD have different patterns of brain activation and white matter connections than found in children developing typically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/29,32-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,32-38</a>]. These findings support the notion that DCD is the result of abnormal brain development rather than the extreme end of the normal range of motor skills. Neuroimaging also supports the hypothesis that children with DCD have difficulty in motor automaticity, with less activation of brain regions responsible for motor automaticity and increased activation of pathways for purposeful mindful movement. In addition, studies show differences in the frontal-parietal connection, in keeping with the difficulty children with DCD have with the integration of visual-spacial information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Genetic factors appear important; a study of 10,895 twin pairs estimated that genetic effects account for approximately 70 percent of the variation in children with DCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. However, the overlap between DCD and other neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), makes it difficult to determine which gene or genes are responsible for which conditions. Copy-number variations have been identified that may indicate a susceptibility for DCD and related coexisting conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. There is enough overlap between ADHD and DCD that a family history of one of the conditions may be considered a risk factor for the other.

It is rarely made in children younger than five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Most children with DCD have lifelong delays in achieving motor milestones. However, the delays are most apparent when they begin to interfere with social-adaptive development or at the time of school entry, when the child is compared with his or her peers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/15,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,24</a>]. In retrospect, children with DCD may have had problems with sucking and swallowing during the first year, delayed achievement of motor milestones, persistent toe walking or wide-based gait after 14 months of age, speech problems, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> persistent drooling (after 30 months of age) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/24,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,41</a>].</p><p>Parents may complain that the child has difficulties with everyday tasks, such as tying shoelaces and brushing teeth. Motor delays can interfere with childhood play activities, such as riding a bicycle or playing catch. Delays in self-care skills, or spills and breakage because the child collides with or drops objects, may cause tension in the home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/24,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,41</a>].</p><p>Crude pencil grasp, poor handwriting, and inability to cut paper on a straight line may cause problems in the early school years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/12,15,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15,42</a>]. Teachers may report that the child bumps into classmates, desks, and chairs. The child may be socially ostracized because of diminished motor skills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/12,24,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,24,43</a>].</p><p>Children with DCD may prefer to play with younger children who have similar physical coordination skills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. They may require repeated instruction to learn new motor skills. They also may avoid participation in physical activity and competitive sports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. The avoidance of physical activities may take the form of somatic complaints or result in obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

Limited research suggests that children with more severe DCD have a greater risk of coexisting conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. The associated problems progress with time; as teenagers, children with coexisting conditions have a higher rate of educational, social, and emotional problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5-7,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7,50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8163014\"><span class=\"h2\">ADHD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The association between DCD and ADHD is strong.

Conversely, approximately 50 percent of children with ADHD meet criteria for DCD. The strongest association appears to be between the inattentive subtype of ADHD and fine motor skill deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

Approximately 80 percent of children with ASD have definite motor impairment, judging by performance on the Movement Assessment Battery for Children and the Developmental Coordination Disorder Questionnaire parent questionnaire [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

They tend to be more severe than those in children with DCD and coexisting ADHD. Diagnosing coexisting ASD in children with DCD may facilitate receipt of services.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2992355\"><span class=\"h2\">Learning disabilities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some authors consider DCD a learning disability (ie, persistent difficulty in learning or acquiring motor skills) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,62,63</a>]. However, DCD commonly coexists along with nonmotor learning disabilities such as disabilities in reading or math. The clinical features of learning disabilities are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-clinical-features#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Specific learning disabilities in children: Clinical features&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>Children with DCD may have difficulties in executive function, and struggle with cognitive tasks such as nonverbal working memory, fluency, inhibition, and planning. Theses executive deficiencies are particularly apparent in emotional situations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/64-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-66</a>]. However, children with DCD perform similarly to typically developing children in verbal tasks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/64,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,67</a>]. These findings suggest that motor deficits are more related to visuospatial skills than verbal skills. Difficulties in executive function may interfere with classroom learning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8163029\"><span class=\"h2\">Social skills, emotional, and behavior problems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with DCD are more likely than their peers to have poor social competence, poor motivation, low self-esteem, and sadness. </p><p>Children with DCD are described by parents as isolated, introverted, easily frustrated, and socially immature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. In a large prospective cohort, children with DCD were more likely to have problematic social skills (eg, making friends, maintaining friendships) than their typically developing peers (odds ratio [OR] 1.87) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Research consistently finds that children with DCD have lower social competence, less positive social interaction with classmates, and spend more time on their own than with peers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. A 2013 systematic review confirmed these findings of worse physical, psychological, and social functioning in children with DCD compared with their peers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p>Children with DCD demonstrate lower nonverbal communication ability (ie, the ability to communicate through means other than language) than typically developing children. Nonverbal communication is considered critical to forming and maintaining relationships and decreased nonverbal abilities may account for some of relationship difficulties experienced by children with DCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p>Poor motor skills are an independent risk factor for peer victimization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>] with evidence that the degree of victimization is proportionate to the degree of motor difficulties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. The correlation between motor skills, peer victimization, and mental health difficulties has also been observed in children without DCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/73,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,74</a>].</p><p>Longitudinal studies, twin studies, and cross-sectional studies consistently find an association between childhood DCD and adolescent anxiety, depression, and underdeveloped social skill; twin studies show that a shared genetic vulnerability to motor issues and anxiety may account for part of their co-occurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/75-80\" class=\"abstract_t\">75-80</a>]. These studies generally find that, compared with their same-sex controls, adolescent girls with DCD experience more internalizing symptoms than affected boys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p>Most studies find that the connection between motor difficulties in children and subsequent internalizing symptoms is mediated by social communication skills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/73,75,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,75,79</a>]. Better mental health outcomes have been observed in children with DCD who have a normal verbal IQ and good social communication skills and who report less bullying and higher self-esteem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. Mental health outcomes are worsened by social difficulties and bullying; bullying appears to drive much of this correlation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/70,72,82-85\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,72,82-85</a>]. The relationship between motor difficulties and subsequent internalizing symptoms may be attenuated by efforts that improve social skills. In adolescents with DCD, family and social support are associated with lower levels of internalizing symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/78,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,79</a>].</p><p>Children with DCD report lower assessment of self-worth in childhood and in adolescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Lower self-worth has been shown to correlate with lower motor skills, perceived poor social supports and victimization by peers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/43,86,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,86,87</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H966200071\"><span class=\"h2\">Decreased physical activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with DCD are less physically active than their typically developing peers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-coordination-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,88</a>].
