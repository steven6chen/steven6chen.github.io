With time, there have been major shifts in the etiologies of complicated peptic ulcers and in the affected patient populations. In addition, management has undergone dramatic changes. Management now includes the early use of high-dose intravenous proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), treatment to eradicate Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), improved endoscopic methods for control of hemorrhage, and changes in surgical indications and procedures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-regimens-for-helicobacter-pylori\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment regimens for Helicobacter pylori&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=proton-pump-inhibitors-overview-of-use-and-adverse-effects-in-the-treatment-of-acid-related-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Proton pump inhibitors: Overview of use and adverse effects in the treatment of acid related disorders&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-bleeding-peptic-ulcers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of bleeding peptic ulcers&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of the major complications of PUD.

While older studies suggested that hospitalizations for potentially life-threatening ulcer complications were stable or even increasing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/1-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-7</a>], several more recent studies indicate a consistent decrease in hospitalization rates and in the incidence of bleeding and perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. For example, using analysis of a large database from the United States found an approximate 30 to 40 percent fall in hospitalizations for PUD complications between 1993 and 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Another study from the United States evaluated the National Inpatient Database and found that the rate of perforation and bleeding has been decreasing in the United States, presumably reflecting the fall in H. pylori prevalence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. A large systematic review estimated that the annual incidence of peptic ulcer hemorrhage is on the order of 19 to 57 cases per 100,000 individuals, and that the annual incidence of ulcer perforation is on the order of 4 to 14 cases per 100,000 individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiology of peptic ulcer disease&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>Peptic ulcer bleeding is seen most commonly in older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/1,2,5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,5-8</a>]. Sixty percent of patients are above the age of 60 years and 20 percent are over the age of 80 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This age distribution likely reflects increasing nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use among older adults, combined with decreasing prevalence of H. pylori infection among younger patients.</p><p>Complications of PUD vary in frequency geographically. In the United States, hemorrhage is the most common complication of PUD (73 percent), followed by perforation (9 percent), and obstruction (3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The mortality rate from complications of PUD is more than 10 times that of acute appendicitis or acute cholecystitis. Perforation has the highest mortality rate, followed by obstruction and hemorrhage. By contrast, a 13-year review of all surgical procedures for peptic ulcer complications at a Nigerian hospital found that obstruction was the most common complication (56 percent), followed by perforation (30 percent), and bleeding (10 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Some regional factors that may account for these differences include the rates of NSAID use, the prevalence of H. pylori infection, and the distribution and extent of gastritis.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiology of peptic ulcer disease&quot;</a>.) Although controversial in early studies because of difficulty detecting H. pylori in the setting of acute bleeding, evidence now clearly implicates both H. pylori and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, as the primary causes of ulcer bleeding and perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H56805158\"><span class=\"h2\">NSAIDs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of NSAIDs is the most commonly identified risk factor for peptic ulcer bleeding, especially in the elderly. Studies have found relative risks for bleeding ranging from 2.7 to 33.9 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Studies have also shown that the risk is drug-specific and dose-dependent. As an example, in a study of 2777 patients, the overall relative risk (RR) of bleeding associated with NSAID use was 5.3 (95% CI 4.5-6.2). However, the risk varied by drug and was lowest for aceclofenac (RR 3.1, 95% CI 2.3-4.2) and was highest for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketorolac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketorolac</a> (RR 14.4, 95% CI 5.2-39.9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The risk was higher in patients taking high-dose NSAIDs compared with those taking medium- or low-dose NSAIDs (RR 6.8, 95% CI 5.3-8.8 versus 4.0, 95% CI 3.2-5.0). There was also an increased risk of bleeding with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> use (RR 5.3) that again was dose-dependent (RR 7.5 with 500 mg per day versus 2.7 with 100 mg per day). The concurrent use of aspirin and NSAIDs conferred an even greater risk of bleeding than was seen with either agent alone (RR 12.7). Finally, the risk was highest in the first 30 days of NSAID use, with a RR of 7.6 (95% CI 6.0-9.5). The risk remained high between days 31 and 90 days (RR 7.3, 95% CI 4.0-13.2), but dropped after 91 days (RR 2.6, 95% CI 1.6-4.1).</p><p>NSAID use has also been identified as a risk factor for ulcer perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/16,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,19</a>]. In a study of 176 patients from Spain, NSAID use was the only risk factor that was significantly associated with perforation (odds ratio [OR] 3.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H56805165\"><span class=\"h2\">H. pylori infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple studies have identified H. pylori infection as a risk factor for complicated PUD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. In one study with 370 patients with peptic ulcers, patients with H. pylori were at significantly increased risk for bleeding from duodenal (RR 6.0, 95% CI 2.9-12.3) but not gastric ulcers (RR 1.7, 95% CI 0.7-4.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, identifying H. pylori can be difficult in the setting of acute bleeding or in patients receiving PPIs. </p><p>With regard to testing for H. pylori, it should be kept in mind that:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biopsy-based tests for H. pylori, such as the rapid urease test, are less sensitive in a patient with recent bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Although a positive serology when other H. pylori tests are negative may be a false-positive, it may be a true-positive if there has been suppression of organism number or if there is isolated duodenal H. pylori colonization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], an important cause of apparent H. pylori-negative, NSAID-negative ulcer.

However, a single negative test has low predictive value, so two tests must be performed under appropriate conditions to confirm that H. pylori is absent. For tests dependent upon the number of organisms (eg, biopsy urease test, urea breath test, stool antigen test, or histology), the patient must have been off of PPIs, antibiotics, or bismuth for at least two weeks before negative results can be interpreted as reflecting a true absence of organisms. Some patients are very reluctant to stop PPIs, in particular, so it is important to confirm that the drugs have been stopped.

A meta-analysis that identified nine case-control studies that assessed the prevalence of H. pylori infection and NSAID use in patients with peptic ulcer bleeding suggested that the H. pylori infection combined with NSAID use increases the risk of bleeding above that seen with either risk factor alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The analysis found that individually, the odds ratios for bleeding peptic ulcers associated with H. pylori and NSAIDs use were 1.8 (95% CI 0.97-3.3) and 4.9 (95% CI 3.8-6.2), respectively, whereas the odds ratio increased to 6.1 when both H. pylori and NSAID were present (95% CI 3.9-9.6).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H56805613\"><span class=\"h2\">Non-H. pylori, non-NSAID ulcers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of complications in patients with non-H. pylori, non-NSAID ulcers is an increasing problem, with a high incidence of recurrent ulcer bleeding.

While acid hypersecretion leading to complicated PUD may be due to gastrinoma, idiopathic acid hypersecretion should also be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].

Refractory, giant (&gt;2 cm), and pyloric channel ulcers are associated with higher complications rates. In addition, most complicated ulcers are chronic and fibrosed. Chronic ulcers may penetrate deeply into the wall to form a dense fibrotic scar that is slow to heal, erodes blood vessels, or reaches the serosa. However, some complicated ulcers, especially in new NSAID users or in hospitalized patients (stress ulcers), are acute and occur without dense fibrosis or a prolonged ulcer history.

Excellent results are possible with well coordinated, skilled, timely decision-making and implementation. For example, with skilled, timely care, in one study all 66 high-risk patients with ulcer bleeding (shock on admission, age older than 65 years, an ulcer size greater than 2 cm, stigmata of recent bleeding, or a history of prior gastric surgery) survived five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4460489\"><span class=\"h2\">Acid suppressive therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with complicated peptic ulcers should receive acid suppressive therapy with an intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI).

For patients with bleeding ulcers, the suggested doses of intravenous pantoprazole, omeprazole, and esomeprazole are all 80 mg bolus followed by 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/hr</span> infusion.

In light of the currently available evidence (and the inability to identify rapid metabolizers who are likely to benefit from higher dosing), use of either continuous infusions or intravenous bolus dosing appears reasonable.

Duodenal, antral, and gastric body ulcers account for 60, 20, and 20 percent of perforations due to peptic ulcer disease (PUD), respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,72</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H66923600\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following three phases have been described when there is free perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the initial phase (within two hours of onset), abdominal pain is usually sudden, sometimes producing collapse or syncope. Localization is usually epigastric, but it quickly becomes generalized. This catastrophic onset reflects bathing of the peritoneal cavity with acidic fluid, which likely results in the release of the vasoactive mediators that underlie the physiologic response. Tachycardia, a weak pulse, cool extremities, and a low temperature are characteristic features. The stage may last only a few minutes or up to two hours. The severity of the onset depends upon how much fluid is released. Pain may radiate to the top of the right shoulder or to both shoulders. As this phase progresses, abdominal rigidity begins to develop.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the second phase (usually 2 to 12 hours after onset), abdominal pain may lessen and an inexperienced observer may be led to believe that the patient is getting better. Pain is usually generalized, often markedly worse upon movement, and the abdomen consistently displays marked board-like rigidity. There may be obliteration of liver dullness to percussion due to peritoneal air. The pelvic peritoneum, palpated at rectal examination, is often tender due to irritation from collected inflammatory fluid. Right lower quadrant tenderness may develop from fluid moving down the pericolic gutter.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the third phase (usually &gt;12 hours after onset), increasing abdominal distention is noted, but abdominal pain, tenderness, and rigidity may be less evident. Temperature elevation and hypovolemia due to &quot;third-spacing&quot; into the peritoneal cavity develop and acute cardiovascular collapse may occur as peritonitis advances. Persisting or advancing signs of peritonitis and a preoperative delay greater than 12 hours increase the risk of a poor outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/39,40,48,50,51,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40,48,50,51,74</a>]. In addition, perforated gastric ulcers appear to have a poorer prognosis than duodenal ulcers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p/><p>If the perforation is walled off or if the gastric fluid is confined by fibrosis, symptoms may be much less severe and these phases may not be apparent. Posterior (retroperitoneal) perforation is another situation where symptoms are less dramatic. Compared to free intraperitoneal perforations, the upper abdominal pain is more insidious, the presentation often delayed, and the abdominal examination is frequently equivocal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H66923362\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rapid diagnosis is essential, since the prognosis is excellent within the first six hours, but deteriorates with more than a 12-hour delay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/50,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,73</a>].

Careful interpretation of upright chest and abdominal films can detect diagnostic free air in many cases of perforated gastric and duodenal ulcers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. The presence of free air on abdominal imaging is highly indicative of a perforated viscus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F76267\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76267 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F55270\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef55270 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F70824\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70824 \">image 3</a>), although about 10 to 20 percent of patients with a perforated duodenal ulcer will not have free air [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. If free air is found, no other diagnostic studies are necessary. Leakage of water soluble oral contrast may be useful in selected cases. Once the oral contrast is given, the patient should be rotated 360 degrees and placed on the right side to fill the antrum and duodenum with contrast. However, many perforations have already sealed spontaneously by the time of presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>], so the absence of a leak does not exclude the diagnosis of a perforated ulcer.</p><p>If there is no free air on the plain film, computed tomography (CT) or ultrasound can be useful to detect small amounts of free air or fluid. In a small proportion of cases, free fluid will be the only clue indicating perforation on imaging studies and a few percent of cases will have neither free air nor fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Spiral and multidetector-row CTs, especially 64 slice scanners, allow the entire abdomen to be examined on a single breath-hold and improve detection of small amounts of air and indirect findings (eg, fluid, phlegmon, abscess, wall pathology and adjacent inflammation) and can provide very useful indirect clues to pathology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F70824\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70824 \">image 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/78,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,79</a>]. Spiral CTs are undoubtedly much more sensitive than ultrasound for detecting fluid, air, or other clues to perforation. Spiral CT with oral contrast sensitively detects persisting leaks across perforated ulcers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H66923472\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the diagnosis of an ulcer perforation has been made, initial management includes insertion of a nasogastric tube, intravenous volume replacement, treatment with an intravenous proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and broad spectrum antibiotics.

Based on the experience with bleeding, it is reasonable to anticipate that intravenous PPIs will enhance fibrin formation and promote rapid sealing of perforations. Therefore, we recommend starting an intravenous PPI as early as possible, with an 80 mg loading dose and 8 mg per hour of the PPI; however, lower doses and twice daily bolus dosing may be equally effective, as noted above.

The antimicrobial susceptibility patterns for gram negative rods such as Escherichia coli have changed, with increasing resistance to antibiotics. Thus, knowledge of local and regional susceptibility patterns for Enterobacteriaceae is essential in selecting empiric therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/80-82\" class=\"abstract_t\">80-82</a>].&nbsp;</p><p>Reasonable choices for initial empiric antibiotic therapy in the setting of perforated ulcer include a combination beta <span class=\"nowrap\">lactam/beta</span> lactamase inhibitor (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-and-sulbactam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin-sulbactam</a>, ticarcillin-clavulanic acid, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piperacillin-and-tazobactam-sodium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piperacillin-tazobactam</a>), or a combination of a third-generation cephalosporin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a>.

After resuscitation, emergent operation and closure with a piece of omentum is the standard of care for patients with an acute perforation and a rigid abdomen with free intraperitoneal air. If the patient is stable or improving, especially if spontaneous sealing of the perforation has been demonstrated, nonoperative management with close monitoring is a reasonable option. With any free perforation, regardless of the presence or size of the leak, if the patient's status is deteriorating, urgent surgery is indicated. Prolonged efforts to establish a diagnosis or pursue nonoperative care despite worsening status can be counterproductive, since a needed operation will be delayed. In addition, surgery is indicated in circumstances where the cause of an acute abdomen has not been established or the patient's status cannot be closely monitored.

A study of 152 patients whose perforations sealed spontaneously found re-leakage in only two patients, comparing favorably with postoperative re-leak rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. The probability of sealing with nonoperative care and intravenous PPIs or H2 receptor antagonists has not been studied; however, over 50 percent of patients with perforated duodenal ulcers have sealed spontaneously when first examined.</p><p>Some patients require nonoperative management because severe comorbid illnesses preclude surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/86,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">86,87</a>]. In a retrospective series of 30 high-risk patients treated nonoperatively, 11 patients were treated with H2 receptor antagonists (prior to 1996) and 19 were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a> 40 mg daily (1996 and later) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. Mortality was 64 percent in the early period and 11 percent in the later period. Hypotension upon presentation was a major risk factor for a poor outcome. These data raise the hypothesis that PPI treatment promotes sealing of perforations. However, a low mortality rate (3.5 percent) was also seen in a series of 84 high-risk patients treated with percutaneous drainage and H2 receptor antagonists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].</p><p>Nonoperative management may also be considered for patients with delayed presentations. If the patient has a persistent leak across the perforation, surgery may be indicated, but can be complicated by peritoneal contamination. Other options in this setting include nonoperative care with percutaneous peritoneal drainage, especially for patients who are not good surgical candidates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].</p><p>Patients with perforated ulcers should have an upper endoscopy to look for evidence of malignancy, to biopsy for H. pylori, and to assess for ulcer healing. To allow the perforation to heal, we suggest waiting at least two weeks prior to performing an upper endoscopy. If the procedure does not need to be done urgently, we prefer to wait six to eight weeks to allow for ulcer healing. At that time, biopsies can be obtained to look for infection with H. pylori and to rule out malignancy (particularly in the case of a nonhealing gastric ulcer).

A longstanding ulcer history is common, but not invariable, in patients who develop penetration. Penetration often comes to attention because of a change in symptoms or involvement of adjacent structures. The change in symptom pattern may be gradual or sudden; it usually involves a loss of cyclicity of the pain with meals, and loss of food and antacid relief. The pain typically becomes more intense, of longer duration, and is frequently referred to the lower thoracic or upper lumbar region. </p><p>Surgical series suggest that penetration occurs in 20 percent of ulcers, but only a small proportion of penetrating ulcers become clinically evident [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. Penetration occurs in descending order of frequency into the pancreas, lesser omentum, biliary tract, liver, greater omentum, mesocolon, colon, and vascular structures. Antral and duodenal ulcers can penetrate into the pancreas. Pyloric or prepyloric ulcers can penetrate the duodenum, eventually leading to a gastroduodenal fistula evident as a &quot;double&quot; pylorus.</p><p>Penetration can be associated with a wide array of uncommon complications including perivisceral abscess (evident on computed tomography or ultrasonography) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>], erosion into vascular structures leading to exsanguinating hemorrhage (aortoenteric fistula) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>], or erosion into the cystic artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>].

Most cases are associated with duodenal or pyloric channel ulceration. As peptic ulcers have become less frequent, malignancy has emerged as a predominant cause of gastric outlet obstruction despite the lower overall rates of gastric cancer. Peptic ulcer disease accounts for only about 5 percent of gastric outlet obstructions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/72,95,96\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,95,96</a>].

Some of this decrease may be due to more effective endoscopic and medical management, including the ability to identify and reverse underlying causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/72,97\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,97</a>].</p><p>No distinct pathophysiologic factors have been identified that promote obstruction, though several elements can contribute to the development of gastric outlet obstruction:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapidly reversible elements include spasm, edema, inflammation, and pyloric dysmotility related to the ulcer or inflammatory changes</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fibrosis, scarring, and deformity underlie slowly reversible or irreversible obstruction</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastric atony, which develops after prolonged obstruction, contributes to gastric retention</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4460730\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of gastric retention include early satiety, bloating, indigestion, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, and weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/72,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,98</a>]. In a surgical series, vomiting was the presenting symptom in 80 percent of cases; it occurred more frequently than once daily in 41 percent of patients, once daily in 34 percent, and less often in 25 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. The presence of recognizable food more than 8 to 12 hours after eating was uncommon, but highly suggestive of gastric retention. The presence of a succussion splash on abdominal examination several hours after eating or drinking is a useful clue if present. The average duration of symptoms was one month, although one-third had symptoms for longer than three months.</p><p>Patterns drawn from surgical series are useful, but the presentation in a general medical setting may be different. Important variables include the patient's response to these symptoms, age, comorbid conditions, and general health status. Some patients with chronic organic disease (peptic ulcers in particular) have visceral hyposensitization (see <a href=\"#H4460443\" class=\"local\">'Preceding symptoms'</a> above). In such patients, high-grade outlet obstruction may be present without perceived gastric distress. Appetite and food intake may be preserved in association with delayed, large volume vomiting of undigested food. Conversely, some patients may have minimal or intermittent obstruction, but complain of considerable nausea, pain, and indigestion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4460738\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis and differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step is to determine whether the symptoms are due to gastric retention and, if so, whether outlet obstruction is the underlying cause. Measuring gastric residual volumes and performing a saline load test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F63196\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63196 \">table 2</a>) can establish the diagnosis of mechanical outlet obstruction.</p><p>Definitive diagnosis of gastric pathology must await gastric cleansing, decompression, and correction of fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. Endoscopic inspection and biopsy are indicated in suspected cases of gastric outlet obstruction and usually provide a definitive diagnosis of the underlying pathology, especially for excluding malignancy. Conventional upper gastrointestinal radiography can provide useful information, but is often not definitive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. A computed tomographic scan <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surgery may be required if there is a heightened suspicion for malignancy and biopsies are unrevealing.</p><p>A number of entities must be excluded in the differential diagnosis of gastric outlet obstruction, which is described separately.

If gastric retention is confirmed, the nasogastric tube should be replaced by a large bore Ewald tube and the stomach lavaged to remove debris. The nasogastric tube should then be reinserted, good function confirmed, and intermittent suction continued for three to five days to decompress the stomach while intravenous fluid and electrolytes are administered.</p><p>Prolonged vomiting and poor fluid intake may lead to prerenal azotemia, hyponatremia, and a hypokalemic, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis. Intravenous saline will restore the volume status and urine output; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium chloride</a> should also be administered as indicated. Intravenous proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are used, as considered below. Careful assessment of nutritional status is required and intravenous hyperalimentation should be considered in malnourished patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition support in critically ill patients: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the past, patients with gastric outlet obstruction due to PUD traditionally were sent to surgery if they failed to respond to three days of nasogastric suction. However, in cases where the cause can be reversed (eg, H. pylori or NSAIDs), a more conservative approach deserves consideration. Approximately one-half of cases of gastric outlet obstruction due to peptic ulcer and associated spasm, edema, inflammation, or pyloric dysmotility respond initially to medical treatment, although some initial responders may eventually require surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>] or endoscopic dilatation.</p><p>Gastric outlet obstruction is not an emergency; in patients who fail to respond to medical therapy, both endoscopic and surgical intervention should be delayed until the patient has been stabilized and fluid and electrolyte balance restored. Delays are also appropriate if the patient's nutritional status is compromised (a serum albumin level<strong> </strong>less than 2.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> is a strong predictor of a poor surgical outcome) or if the stomach is markedly dilated (postoperative gastric atony is more likely and may be prevented by preoperative decompression).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4460754\"><span class=\"h3\">Identifying and treating underlying causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the patient has been stabilized and gastric outlet obstruction has been confirmed, the next steps are to identify and treat the underlying cause of the obstruction. Even cases with a good clinical response require endoscopy and biopsy to exclude malignancy, diagnose ulcer disease, and determine if H. pylori is present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastric-outlet-obstruction-in-adults#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastric outlet obstruction in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>There is evidence for [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/102-104\" class=\"abstract_t\">102-104</a>] and against [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>] an association between H. pylori and obstruction, probably due to the low frequency of the complication, the small size of the studies, and patient selection. There are case reports and small series which indicate that cure of H. pylori infection heals the ulcers, resolves the outlet obstruction, and prevents recurrence of obstruction in most, but not all, cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/102,106-108\" class=\"abstract_t\">102,106-108</a>].</p><p>Although data are limited, there is sufficient evidence to indicate that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are an important cause of obstruction. Furthermore, a substantial proportion of patients with outlet obstruction due to NSAID-induced PUD respond to medical therapy as long as NSAID use is discontinued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>]. In a study of 119 elderly patients undergoing endoscopy for PUD, 12 cases with obstruction were found, 11 of whom were consuming NSAIDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. All cases responded to medical management alone.

In particular, great caution should be exercised in using surgical intervention in patients who are likely to continue NSAID use, since continued use predicts postoperative ulcer recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>].

Intravenous PPI therapy is warranted during the initial gastric decompression phase to reduce intravenous fluid requirements, control gastric pH, and facilitate ulcer healing. Based on the precedent for the acute management of bleeding peptic ulcers, a high-dose PPI regimen using an 80 mg loading dose, followed by 8 mg per hour of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a> or equivalent PPI, seems appropriate until the obstruction has resolved; however, lower doses and twice daily bolus dosing may be equally effective, as noted above (see <a href=\"#H4460489\" class=\"local\">'Acid suppressive therapy'</a> above).</p><p>After the patient resumes oral intake and is emptying liquids, a liquid antisecretory preparation is needed, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> powder. Since standard preparations of the five proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esomeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">esomeprazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lansoprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lansoprazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rabeprazole</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pantoprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pantoprazole</a>) use enteric-coated formulations, good emptying of solids is required for effective drug delivery; their oral use is therefore limited until the obstruction has resolved and motility has recovered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antiulcer-medications-mechanism-of-action-pharmacology-and-side-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antiulcer medications: Mechanism of action, pharmacology, and side effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Oral antisecretory therapy with PPIs or H2 receptor antagonists is appropriate for long-term management of patients who have had a gastric outlet obstruction due to PUD. After H. pylori infection is treated (if present), full dose oral antisecretory medication should probably be continued until successful cure of the infection has been confirmed and antral-duodenal deformities have resolved. Although only documented anecdotally, the combination of curing H. pylori infection, continued antisecretory therapy, and time will eventually reverse antral-duodenal deformity and tendency for recurrent obstruction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20204441\"><span class=\"h3\">Endoscopic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who fail to respond to medical therapy may require endoscopic dilation or surgery.

No studies resolve the question of whether curing H. pylori reduces recurrences following definitive ulcer surgery in the subset of patients with H. pylori. However, two reports indicated that persistent postoperative H. pylori infection is associated with advancing atrophic gastritis or precursor lesions that may underlie the increased rate of gastric cancer observed after definitive peptic ulcer surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/125,126\" class=\"abstract_t\">125,126</a>]. Considering these factors and the weight of evidence implicating H. pylori in ulcer recurrence, we suggest that the organism be eradicated (if present) even in patients who have undergone definitive ulcer surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18363529\"><span class=\"h2\">Non-H. pylori, non-NSAID ulcers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While less common, ulcers not due to H. pylori infection or NSAIDs are prone to frequent recurrences that often require continued maintenance medical therapy or surgery. This point was illustrated in a prospective study that compared 120 patients with a history of H. pylori-negative, NSAID-negative bleeding ulcers to 213 patients with a history of H. pylori positive bleeding ulcers who were treated successfully with eradication therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>]. At follow-up of up to seven years, the H. pylori negative patients had a significantly higher rate of recurrent bleeding (42 versus 11 percent). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-etiology-of-peptic-ulcer-disease#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and etiology of peptic ulcer disease&quot;, section on 'H. pylori'</a>.)<br/><br/>In patients with presumed non-H. pylori, non-NSAID ulcers, every effort must be made to exclude H. pylori infection and NSAID use and to determine the cause of the ulcer. A cause for most non-H. pylori, non-NSAID ulcers can be established (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F75002\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75002 \">table 3</a>). For example, crack cocaine use can cause perforated ulcers. The ulcers should be diligently treated and reversible factors contributing to ulcer development should be addressed to decrease the risk of recurrent complications.

Most large studies of definitive ulcer surgery were performed prior to the recognition of H. pylori, the role of NSAIDs, and potent antisecretory agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/128-131\" class=\"abstract_t\">128-131</a>]. Over the past two decades, gastric resections and definitive acid-reducing procedures have continued to decline with no changes in outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/132\" class=\"abstract_t\">132</a>].</p><p>An illustrative report included 159 patients who were followed more than 10 years after vagotomy and pyloroplasty for perforated duodenal ulcer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/130\" class=\"abstract_t\">130</a>]. The perioperative mortality was 5.5 percent, ulcers recurred in 8.8 percent, and postoperative digestive sequelae, notably diarrhea and dumping, developed in 16 percent. Similar recurrence rates (but with less morbidity) have been described in patients who underwent parietal cell vagotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/131\" class=\"abstract_t\">131</a>].</p><p>Even though no data are available to compare the risks of definitive ulcer surgery to current medical treatment, a few points are relevant:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In light of the demonstrated benefits of medical treatment (curing H. pylori, eliminating NSAIDs, and using potent antisecretory agents) for decreasing complicated ulcer recurrence, the rates of performing definitive ulcer procedures during emergency surgery have fallen dramatically, without any obvious deleterious impact on outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/38,56,132,133\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,56,132,133</a>].

Although the cause of the ulcer disease may not be known at the time of surgery, all forms respond quite well to medical management. However, the proportion of patients who will not tolerate, be adherent with, or respond to medical treatment is likely to be very small and elective definitive ulcer surgery can be reserved for this subset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/134\" class=\"abstract_t\">134</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with acid hypersecretion, definitive ulcer surgery (eg, vagotomy) should be avoided because there is a high risk of postoperative ulcer recurrence. This approach is well established for patients with gastrinomas, but also appears to pertain to patients with nongastrinoma acid hypersecretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/135\" class=\"abstract_t\">135</a>].

For reasons that have not been defined, the relative prominence of these complications varies in different regions. (See <a href=\"#H62849741\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although a history of preceding ulcer symptoms is common, many patients have no preceding typical peptic ulcer symptoms or known disease. (See <a href=\"#H4460443\" class=\"local\">'Preceding symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain management principles apply to all patients with complicated ulcers, regardless of type (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F65479\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65479 \">table 1</a>). These principles include coordination of care among the surgical and medical teams, early administration of intravenous proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for acid suppression, treatment of H. pylori if present (after the patient resumes oral feedings), and discontinuation of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), at least until healing has been established. (See <a href=\"#H4460472\" class=\"local\">'General approach to patients with complicated ulcers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Appropriate treatment for patients with bleeding ulcers generally includes fluid resuscitation to correct hypovolemia; blood transfusions as necessary; early, high-dose intravenous PPI (80 mg loading and 8 mg per hour of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omeprazole</a> or equivalent is usually recommended, though lower doses administered by intravenous bolus appear equally effective); and endoscopic intervention for ulcers with stigmata of active bleeding. Surgery or angiography is required when two endoscopic treatment sessions have failed or bleeding recurs after these interventions, especially in hemodynamically unstable patients. (See <a href=\"#H4460451\" class=\"local\">'Bleeding'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4460489\" class=\"local\">'Acid suppressive therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ulcer perforation should be suspected in patients with or without a history of peptic ulcer symptoms or disease who develop the sudden onset of severe epigastric or diffuse abdominal pain or, especially in elderly patients, sudden decompensation. Once the diagnosis of an ulcer perforation has been made, initial management includes insertion of a nasogastric tube, intravenous volume replacement, treatment with an intravenous PPI, and appropriate antibiotics. A decision then is made about whether the patient requires surgery. (See <a href=\"#H4460621\" class=\"local\">'Perforation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with an acute perforation and a rigid abdomen with free intraperitoneal air, emergent operation and closure with a piece of omentum is the standard of care. Furthermore, with an established ulcer perforation, regardless of the presence or size of the leak, if the patient's status is deteriorating, urgent surgery is indicated. Lastly, surgery is indicated in circumstances where the cause of an acute abdomen has not been established or the patient's status cannot be carefully monitored. (See <a href=\"#H66923472\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.) <br/><br/>Despite this standard of care, there are several situations where continuing nonoperative care appears justifiable, especially because there are no rigorous data available to guide treatment decisions. If the patient is stable or improving, especially if imaging studies show spontaneous sealing of the perforation, then continued nonoperative management with close monitoring is a reasonable option. Furthermore, for patients with small to moderate leaks who are clinically stable, some studies suggest that nonoperative management with close monitoring is reasonable. Lastly, patients who are at very high risk for surgery because of comorbidity can have surprisingly low mortality with rigorous, nonoperative management. There are two critical unknowns: the ability of intravenous PPIs to accelerate sealing of the perforation and the role for percutaneous drainage. The latter appears to be very useful for patients with persisting leaks across perforated ulcers who are adequately stable to tolerate nonoperative care. (See <a href=\"#H73184426\" class=\"local\">'Operative versus nonoperative management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ulcer penetration refers to penetration of the ulcer through the bowel wall without free perforation and leakage of luminal contents into the peritoneal cavity. Penetration often comes to attention because of a change in symptoms or involvement of adjacent structures. Patients are typically managed in a manner similar to patients with refractory peptic ulcers. (See <a href=\"#H4460706\" class=\"local\">'Penetration'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-refractory-or-recurrent-peptic-ulcer-disease#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to refractory or recurrent peptic ulcer disease&quot;, section on 'Initial management'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastric outlet obstruction is the least common ulcer complication. Most cases are associated with duodenal or pyloric channel ulceration. Symptoms of gastric outlet obstruction include early satiety, bloating, indigestion, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, and weight loss. Malignancy is a more common cause of gastric outlet obstruction and must be excluded. Some patients can be managed medically, whereas others require endoscopic balloon dilation or surgery. (See <a href=\"#H4460714\" class=\"local\">'Gastric outlet obstruction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H448421734\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Andrew H Soll, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-complications-of-peptic-ulcer-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Ohmann C, Imhof M, Ruppert C, et al.
