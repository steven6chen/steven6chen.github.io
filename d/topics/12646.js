GN is caused by a number of disorders that are all characterized by glomerular injury accompanied by inflammation. In some cases, GN may progress to renal failure.</p><p>The pathogenesis and etiology of glomerulonephritis in children will be reviewed here. The approach to evaluating a child with glomerulonephritis is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-a-child-with-glomerular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of a child with glomerular disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the pathogenesis is not fully understood, current evidence suggests that most cases of glomerulonephritis (GN) are due to an immunologic response to a variety of different etiologic agents. The immunologic response, in turn, activates a number of biological processes (eg, complement activation, leukocyte recruitment, and release of growth factors and cytokines) that result in glomerular inflammation and injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pathogenesis-and-causes-of-glomerulonephritis-in-children/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. GN may be isolated to the kidney (primary glomerulonephritis) or be a component of a systemic disorder (secondary glomerulonephritis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52094\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52094 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The immunologic mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of GN are briefly reviewed here and are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-immune-injury-of-the-glomerulus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of immune injury of the glomerulus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunologic damage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Humoral (also referred to T helper cell 2-regulated) immune response to a variety of inciting agents results in immunoglobulin deposition and complement activation within the glomeruli. In most of these disorders, immune complex deposition is an active process caused by in situ binding of antibodies to antigens localized within the glomeruli. The antigens may be structural glomeruli components, such as the Goodpasture antigen in the non-collagenous domain of the alpha-3 chain of type IV collagen in the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pathogenesis-and-causes-of-glomerulonephritis-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Alternatively, the antigens may be trapped or deposited within the glomerulus, including self-antigens such as DNA in the form of nucleosomes in lupus nephritis, or exogenous antigens due to infectious agents such as bacteria (Streptococcus, Staphylococcus), viruses (hepatitis B), or tumor antigens. These in situ-formed immune complexes may enlarge if there is further immune response consisting of polyclonal B-cell activation, which induces the formation of different antibodies. These include rheumatic factors immunoglobulin M (IgM), anti-immunoglobulin G (IgG), or anti-idiotypic antibodies that bind to these complexes.</p><p>Another possible mechanism for immune complex deposition is the passive process of trapping circulating immune complexes within the glomeruli. Although this process has been studied in animal models (serum sickness disease), it appears to be less commonly seen in human GN than in situ glomerular immune complex formation.</p><p>Glomerulonephritis that is due to antibody formation requires the presence of T lymphocytes. However, T lymphocytes may also cause glomerulonephritis in the absence of antibodies, as demonstrated in an experimental rat model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pathogenesis-and-causes-of-glomerulonephritis-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Although the mechanism for this cellular-mediated immunity is less well-defined in humans, it appears to involve activation of both T cell lymphocytes and macrophages, particularly in rapidly progressive (crescentic) GN. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-glomerular-crescent-formation#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of glomerular crescent formation&quot;, section on 'Macrophages'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-glomerular-crescent-formation#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of glomerular crescent formation&quot;, section on 'T cells'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Secondary processes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary immunologic pathologic process activates the following systems that contribute to the inflammatory response and glomerular damage.

In some renal disorders (eg, membranoproliferative type II and poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis) the alternative pathway is activated. Complement activation results in generation of chemotactic and chemokinetic peptides (C3a, C5a, and C3b) that attract white cells to the site of injury, and formation of the membrane attack complex (C5b-C9), which may cause direct injury to glomerular cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pathogenesis-and-causes-of-glomerulonephritis-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] and results in the release of cytokines, reactive oxygen species, and prostaglandins, and cell apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-pathogenesis-and-causes-of-glomerulonephritis-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

This results in thrombi formation and fibrin deposition that are important components in the formation of crescents. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-glomerular-crescent-formation#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of glomerular crescent formation&quot;, section on 'Initiating events'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-glomerular-crescent-formation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of glomerular crescent formation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leukocyte recruitment &minus; A constant feature of GN is the glomerular infiltration of leukocytes (neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages), which are sequentially recruited to the glomeruli by the coordinated release of chemoattractants (eg, C3a, C5a, and CXC chemokines). When activated, these cells generate reactive oxygen species (ROS, such as hydrogen peroxide) and lysosomal enzymes (which damage endothelial cells, the GBM, and the mesangium), and growth factors (which induce fibrin deposition, cell proliferation, and crescent formation). As in patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (previously referred to as Wegner's granulomatosis), who have renal involvement, pathogenesis is due to adherence to renal endothelial cells and release proteases, ROS, and inflammatory cytokines resulting in glomerular injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-cytokines-in-the-immune-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of cytokines in the immune system&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-related-vasculitides#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis and related vasculitides&quot;, section on 'Neutrophil activation and ANCA'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glomerular cells &minus; Injury to the glomerular endothelial and mesangial cells result in cell proliferation, adhesion molecule expression, and the production and release of vasoactive molecules (endothelin and nitric oxide), cytokines, ROS, growth factors, and prostaglandins.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Growth factors and cytokines &ndash; Many growth factors and cytokines (eg, interleukins) are produced by glomerular cells and by inflammatory cells.

A presumptive clinical diagnosis is made based upon the presentation, the presence of extra-renal findings, family history, and laboratory testing, including urinalysis. Histologic confirmation is made by renal biopsy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F52652\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52652 \">figure 1</a>).

Acute nephritis also has been associated with other infectious agents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76710\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76710 \">table 2</a>). Other causes of acute GN include secondary GN (eg, immunoglobulin A vasculitis [IgAV; Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura (HSP)], nephritis associated with subacute bacterial endocarditis, and shunt nephritis).

Empiric therapy may be started in patients with severe disease, particularly if either renal biopsy or interpretation of the biopsy will be delayed.

These often occur one or two days after an upper respiratory infection. Recurrent macroscopic hematuria may also be seen in children with Alport syndrome.

In addition, causes of chronic GN may present as acute nephritic syndrome and may be initially indistinguishable clinically from acute disorders.</p><p>In some cases, patients are diagnosed in a late stage of disease and present with hypertension, renal impairment, and proteinuria with or without hematuria. The renal biopsy at this stage may only demonstrate nonspecific and nondiagnostic findings of fibrosis, glomerular sclerosis, and tubular atrophy on light microscopy. Immunofluorescence microscopy may be more helpful in making a diagnosis.</p><p>Chronic GN that presents in childhood includes both primary GN (eg, MPGN, IgA nephropathy, and anti-GBM disease) and secondary GN (eg, lupus nephritis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Histopathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A renal biopsy sample is often needed to determine the underlying histologic etiology of glomerulonephritis. However, in some cases (eg, poststreptococcal GN) the diagnosis is made clinically, and a biopsy is not required. In other cases, the renal biopsy is needed to make or confirm the diagnosis.</p><p>The histopathologic evaluation consists of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Light microscopy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunofluorescence examination</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electron microscopy</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Light microscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The light microscopic findings generally are not specific, as the same morphological pattern may be produced by a number of different diseases. As an example, MPGN can be caused by a variety of systemic immune complex diseases, including infective endocarditis, systemic lupus erythematous, or hepatitis C viruses, or can be a primary idiopathic disorder.

It is caused by a number of disorders that are all characterized by glomerular injury accompanied by inflammation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathogenesis of GN is not fully understood. Currently available data suggest that most cases of GN are due to an immunologic response to a variety of different etiologic agents. The immunologic response, in turn, activates a number of biological processes (eg, complement activation, leukocyte recruitment, and release of growth factors and cytokines), which result in glomerular inflammation and injury. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because the differential diagnosis for GN is broad, using a classification schema is helpful to narrow the causes of GN in a systematic manner. The etiology of glomerulonephritis in children can be classified by its clinical presentation (acute GN, rapidly progressive GN, recurrent macroscopic hematuria, and chronic GN) or by histopathology. The histologic findings are based upon light, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopy. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Etiologic classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GN may be isolated to the kidney (primary glomerulonephritis) or be a component of a systemic disorder (secondary glomerulonephritis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52094\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52094 \">table 1</a>). Specific causes of GN in children are discussed in separate reviews found elsewhere in the program.
