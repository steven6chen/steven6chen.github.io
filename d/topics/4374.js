Prematurity and low birth weight remain major risk factors for the development of BPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].<strong> </strong>Other contributors to the development of chronic lung injury include swallowing dysfunction, gastrointestinal reflux, and poor nutrition, which are common comorbidities in infants born very prematurely. Because of its chronic nature and multifactorial causes, many infants and children with BPD will require multifaceted and multidisciplinary management well beyond the first year of life. There are no established guidelines for the management of BPD after initial discharge from the hospital. </p><p>The long-term consequences of BPD on the respiratory health of older children and adults are not fully described, especially because changes in the care of premature infants have resulted in important changes in the clinical and pathological characteristics of BPD during recent decades. Although BPD tends to improve with advancing age, it can lead to lifelong consequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. </p><p>The long-term pulmonary outcomes of BPD are reviewed here.

This has led to increased survival of extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants and the evolution of a new type of BPD, with different pathogenesis and clinical features as compared with the classic form of BPD (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and clinical features of bronchopulmonary dysplasia&quot;, section on 'Pathology'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>New BPD</strong> &ndash; The primary characteristic of BPD is impaired alveolar development, due to very premature birth and ELBW. Survival of these infants became more possible after the advent of antepartum glucocorticoid use and surfactant treatment. Interestingly, some infants born very prematurely have little or no respiratory distress at birth, but develop a need for supplemental oxygen <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> positive pressure support by 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). BPD in these infants can occur despite strategies used to minimize lung injury. The pathophysiology that develops in these preterm infants is often referred to as &quot;new&quot; BPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The lungs are characterized by fewer and larger alveoli and dysmorphic pulmonary vasculature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Classic BPD</strong> &ndash; Before the advent of surfactant and more modern management techniques, the most prominent features of BPD were airway injury, inflammation, and alveolar septal fibrosis. These changes were usually associated with oxygen toxicity, barotrauma, and infection. This type of pathophysiology is sometimes termed &quot;classic&quot; or &quot;old&quot; BPD, although infants in the post-surfactant era occasionally still acquire this form of the disease. When these individuals reach adulthood, some have interstitial and emphysematous changes detected by chest radiography and computed tomography (CT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. It is unclear at this time whether these adults will go on to have accelerated loss of lung function or early onset chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as they enter middle age; therefore, they should be followed closely throughout life for decline in lung function. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PULMONARY FUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abnormalities in pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are commonly found in children and adults with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/2,7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7-9</a>]. PFTs frequently show decreased forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) and decreased ratios of FEV<sub>1</sub> to forced vital capacity (FEV<sub>1</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FVC),</span> consistent with airflow limitation and small airway obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. The airflow limitation may be a consequence of dysanaptic growth, in which length and diameter of the airways grow less rapidly than the lung parenchyma, which in turn can cause fixed airflow obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]<em>. </em>However, many children with BPD also have a reactive component to their obstructive lung disease, as demonstrated by their clinical response to steroids and bronchodilators<em> </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]<em>. </em>(See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Asthma-like symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p>Chemoreceptor sensitivity has been shown to be abnormal in the child with BPD, and these changes can persist into adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Infants with BPD may manifest an inability to increase their ventilatory response to hypoxia. The mechanisms are multifactorial and may include abnormalities in the peripheral and central chemoreceptor response to hypoxia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> to abnormal respiratory muscle function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Furthermore, infants with BPD often fail to exhibit a normal decrease in ventilation in response to a hyperoxia challenge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A study performed in 20 school-aged children with BPD found that 60 percent hypoventilated during exercise and developed hypoxemia and hypercapnia, in contrast to healthy controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Infancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary function testing during infancy is not routinely performed in most centers but can be useful when available in tracking changes in pulmonary function, response to bronchodilators and diuretics, and overall severity of disease, particularly in infants not responding well to supportive treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Several studies in older infants (6 to 12 months) with BPD have demonstrated evidence of small airway disease and impaired alveolar growth. Gas trapping and small airway disease was suggested by decreased maximum expiratory flow at functional residual capacity (Vmax<sub>FRC</sub>)<sub> </sub>and low functional to total lung volume ratios (FRC<sub>He</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FRC<sub>pleth</sub>);</span> impaired alveolar growth was suggested by elevated PaCO<sub>2</sub> and increased alveolar-to-arterial gradient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Childhood</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary function testing in older children, adolescents, and adults is widely available and is useful in following longitudinal changes in pulmonary function. Spirometry may be the most useful PFT in detecting lung abnormalities in extremely premature children, including those with BPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In some centers, spirometry can be performed in children as young as three years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]; however, most PFT laboratories begin testing children at six years of age. Both pre- and post-administration of inhaled bronchodilators can be used to test for airway reactivity. Unfortunately, some children with BPD have cognitive difficulties that preclude their ability to perform PFTs. As a result, studies may underestimate the number of children who have abnormal lung function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pulmonary function testing in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although clinical symptoms in individuals with BPD often improve during childhood, PFTs often remain abnormal, particularly in those with more severe disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. One study compared preschool children with healthy controls and found decreased FEV<sub>1</sub>, increased FRC, residual volume (RV), and the ratio of RV to total lung capacity <span class=\"nowrap\">(RV/TLC)</span> in the BPD group, consistent with obstructive lung disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. These findings are consistent with persistent airflow obstruction and gas trapping. </p><p>In many patients, especially those with mild disease, PFTs gradually improve over time, possibly in conjunction with new alveolar development and improvement in small airway flow limitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/11,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,29,30</a>]. In one study, sequential measurements during the first two to three years following hospital discharge demonstrated gradual increases in FRC <span class=\"nowrap\">(mL/kg)</span> from initial low levels to more normal levels, but with persistent limitations of maximum flow at FRC (V<sub>max</sub>FRC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Approximately one-third of these patients responded to bronchodilators. Another study reported improvements in lung compliance (from 50 percent of normal at one month of age to 80 percent of normal at 36 months), and specific pulmonary conductance (from 50 percent of normal at one month to 85 percent of normal at 36 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In another study, forced expiratory flow at two years of age was closely related to forced expiratory flow at eight years, suggesting little recovery of the airways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>Prematurity itself is a dominant risk factor for lung injury and long-term impairment of pulmonary function; whether or not BPD exists, the risk is compounded by postnatal lung injury. One series reported lung function in 48 children who were born at very low birth weight (VLBW) and managed at a tertiary center after the introduction of surfactant therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. At 8.5 &plusmn; 1.0 years, VLBW children had significantly lower FVC, FEV<sub>1</sub>, and carbon monoxide diffusion capacity (DLCO) as compared with 46 age-matched controls. No differences were found between the VLBW children with or without BPD except for a higher <span class=\"nowrap\">RV/TLC</span> ratio in the BPD subgroup (mean difference 7 percent; 95% CI 0.4-13 percent; p = 0.03). In a similar report, 53 extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants (28 with BPD and 25 without BPD) were compared with 23 term controls at 10 &plusmn; 1 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. FEV<sub>1</sub> was significantly lower in the ELBW group (85 &plusmn; 10 percent versus 94 &plusmn; 10 percent, p &lt;0.001), with limited reversibility by bronchodilators. Likewise, <span class=\"nowrap\">RV/TLC</span> and DLCO differed significantly. These measurements did not differ in ELBW subgroups with or without BPD. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H270827816\"><span class=\"h2\">Adults with classic BPD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Long-term abnormalities in pulmonary function and respiratory symptoms have been reported in individuals with the classic form of BPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/14,33-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,33-37</a>]. In a study of 147 adolescents born weighing less than 1500 g in the period 1977 to 1982, pulmonary function testing at a mean of 18.9 years demonstrated clinically significant reduction in airflow and deterioration in pulmonary function since the previous evaluation at eight years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Similarly, long-term studies in children ages 6 to 15 years with BPD found persistent airway obstruction, airway hyperreactivity, and hyperinflation of the lungs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/14,33-35,38-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,33-35,38-56</a>]. Both vital capacity and FEV<sub>1</sub> were reduced as compared with control subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The duration of oxygen dependence in the neonatal period may predict respiratory morbidity during early childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>] and possibly the long-term pulmonary outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>]. These studies reflect in part the management of premature infants 20 years ago; much less is known regarding the long-term outcome of infants managed with modern neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) strategies.</p><p>Only a few studies have compared long-term outcomes of early versus late cohorts (ie, classic BPD versus new BPD). In one study, long-term pulmonary function was evaluated in two groups of subjects that were initially managed in an NICU in Norway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. The first group was born between 1982 and 1985, prior to the use of surfactant. The second group was born between 1991 and 1992 when surfactant was used as rescue therapy for respiratory distress syndrome. As adolescents, the mean FEV<sub>1</sub> was similar between the two groups of children with BPD (81.9 and 80.8 percent predicted) and was lower than the control groups born at term during the same time periods. In a separate systematic review and meta-analysis, long-term outcomes (measured by FEV<sub>1</sub> percent predicted) for children born preterm who required supplemental oxygen at 28 days of life were substantially better for children born during the 1990s compared with earlier decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H132777273\"><span class=\"h1\">RESPIRATORY DISORDERS ASSOCIATED WITH BPD</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Asthma-like symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recurrent wheezing episodes are very common in children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), beginning in the preschool years and continuing into adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/2,7,62-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7,62-64</a>]. Adolescents also experience reduced exercise tolerance, impaired ventilatory adaptation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/34,54,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,54,65</a>], and reduced gas transfer during physical activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/34,52,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,52,66</a>]. As an example, in the EPICure study of children born less than 26 weeks gestation, 25 percent of children had the diagnosis of asthma at 11 years of age, and 56 percent had abnormal spirometry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. </p><p>Although children with BPD have asthma-like symptoms, they are less likely to have the airway hyperresponsiveness that characterizes asthma and less likely to respond to bronchodilators. Only 40 to 50 percent of children with BPD demonstrate significant airway hyperresponsiveness to exercise, histamine or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a>, or a significant response to bronchodilator administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>]. Indeed, in some infants with central airway disease (tracheobronchomalacia), bronchodilators may exacerbate wheezing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/19,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,70</a>] (see <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Acquired tracheobronchomalacia'</a> below). Similarly, children with BPD may respond to inhaled corticosteroids, but the effect is less consistent than in children with asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/19,71-73\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,71-73</a>]. </p><p>BPD and asthma also differ in underlying pathophysiology. The lung of the older child and adult recovered from BPD can demonstrate airway wall thickening similar to individuals with asthma. However, in addition, there are morphologic changes noted on computerized tomography (CT) scans of the chest, including linear and triangular opacities, mosaic perfusion, and air trapping [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>], which can be compatible with a diagnosis of fixed peripheral airway narrowing. Unlike children with asthma, children with airway hyperreactivity due to BPD may not have elevated levels of exhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitric-oxide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">nitric oxide</a> (a marker for eosinophil-driven inflammation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/12,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,75</a>] or an increased incidence of atopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Environmental factors, including tobacco smoke exposure and environmental allergens, may contribute to the pulmonary function abnormalities and respiratory outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/62,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,76</a>].

Such infants require coordinated care involving their primary physician, pediatric otolaryngologist, pulmonologist, and provider of home care services. A speech pathologist is often helpful in the evaluation and management of swallowing and speech development. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Central airway disease'</a> above.)</p><p>Prior to transition to home care, the family must be trained in tracheostomy maintenance and emergency procedures. Two caregivers should be identified and trained in routine suctioning, cleaning and changing the tracheostomy, general respiratory assessment, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation of a patient with a tracheostomy including use of a ventilation bag. The caregivers must demonstrate proficiency in routine and emergency skills before the child is discharged from the health care facility to home. Families should have a back-up tracheostomy tube that is one size smaller (0.5 mm diameter smaller) than the one in use; this will be easier to insert in case of accidental decannulation.</p><p>For any child with a tracheostomy who is at high risk for airway complications and cannot call for help or self-correct a problem, some form of monitoring should be used when not under direct visual monitoring. Pulse oximetry is often chosen over a cardiorespiratory monitor since hypoxemia will usually occur before bradycardia from prolonged hypoxemia, and a child with a critically obstructed or displaced tracheostomy tube will make ineffective breathing efforts that could delay the cardiorespiratory monitor from alarming. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Cardiorespiratory monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p>Because all cardiorespiratory monitors have limitations, an awake caregiver including daily support from a skilled nurse care is considered to be a standard of care in the United States for a child living at home with a tracheostomy. Guidelines vary among US states and are not evidence-based; minimum hours of nursing care for children with tracheostomies are typically eight <span class=\"nowrap\">hours/day</span> for children with tracheostomies, and up to 16 <span class=\"nowrap\">hours/day</span> for those requiring mechanical ventilation via the tracheostomy. This support allows the child to be visually monitored at least while the parents sleep.

Children with tracheostomies should undergo periodic bronchoscopy every 6 to 12 months to monitor the airway, assess tracheostomy tube size, and evaluate readiness for decannulation. Granulomas often form near the tracheostomy site and require removal; other complications include recurrent tracheitis or bronchitis, and (rarely) hemorrhage.</p><p>Only a few case series describe outcomes of children with severe BPD requiring tracheostomy and home positive pressure ventilation (PPV) in the current era of care. In one study of 102 children with respiratory failure secondary to severe BPD requiring PPV at home, 80 percent survived, and the majority were weaned off PPV and decannulated by six years of age, with a median age of liberation from PPV of 24 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/178\" class=\"abstract_t\">178</a>].

When possible, elective decannulation should occur during spring and summer months when respiratory viruses are less frequent in the community. Prior to decannulation, the tracheostomy tube is often downsized. The smaller tracheostomy tube should be large enough to avoid mucous plugging and unplanned decannulation. Successful downsizing of a tracheostomy tube and tolerance of a speaking valve are favorable predictors of subsequent successful decannulation. </p><p>Decannulation of pediatric patients should occur in the hospital setting. Prior to decannulation, the tracheostomy tube is capped for a period of up to 24 hours while the child is closely monitored to determine readiness for decannulation. Patients who have respiratory symptoms (ie, stridor, tachypnea, increased work of breathing, hypoventilation, apnea, or desaturation) during capping trials are unlikely to be successfully decannulated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/181\" class=\"abstract_t\">181</a>]. Polysomnography can also be used to guide successful timing for decannulation when available. One study reported that children with higher <span class=\"nowrap\">apnea/hypopnea</span> indexes during a capped study were less likely to undergo successful decannulation than children with lower <span class=\"nowrap\">apnea/hypopnea</span> indexes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/182\" class=\"abstract_t\">182</a>]. In addition, patients with high <span class=\"nowrap\">apnea/hypopnea</span> indexes can sometimes benefit from an <span class=\"nowrap\">adenoid/tonsillectomy</span> if indicated to minimize obstructive symptoms post-decannulation. Children who fail capping trials should undergo direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy to rule out obstructive lesions that can be addressed surgically.</p><p>In a retrospective review of 46 pediatric patients undergoing elective decannulation in the inpatient setting, the overall failure rate was 9 percent. Children who failed decannulation tended to be younger and to have vocal cord paralysis, although these findings were not statistically significant.

Children on home ventilators should have a medical home with both a generalist and a respiratory subspecialist co-managing care, an alert and attentive caregiver at all times, and at least two trained family members who also receive ongoing education. The guidelines also discuss the use of standardized discharge criteria, pulse-oximetry for monitoring, and specific pieces of essential equipment. </p><p>There are no specific guidelines for candidacy for ventilator weaning or standardized protocols for ventilator weaning. Core principles for ventilator weaning include close monitoring in an inpatient setting, but in select patients outpatient weaning may be done with frequent clinic visits and the use of overnight polysomnography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/184\" class=\"abstract_t\">184</a>].

This is because a cardiorespiratory monitor will only detect changes in heart rate (bradycardia and tachycardia) and central apneas, but not obstructive apneas. Pulse oximetry provides earlier warning of an obstructive event or loss of supplemental oxygen because it measures changes in oxygen saturation.

For infants with tracheostomies, cardiorespiratory monitoring and pulse oximetry does not substitute for an &quot;awake&quot; caregiver who is trained in tracheostomy management and resuscitation because preventable tracheostomy events are a significant source of mortality in pediatric patients who are on mechanical ventilators at home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/185\" class=\"abstract_t\">185</a>].

Further analysis of the data calls into question the validity of the mortality data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/192\" class=\"abstract_t\">192</a>], and an expert panel has published an opinion supporting the use of sildenafil in selected pediatric patients with PAH at moderate doses and with close monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/193\" class=\"abstract_t\">193</a>]; this approach is also supported by European Medicines Agency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-and-long-term-pulmonary-outcomes-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/194\" class=\"abstract_t\">194</a>]. These trials included children with PAH from many causes, and there is minimal data on which to evaluate its benefits and risks for children with BPD-related PAH. Prior to initiation of sildenafil for BPD-related PAH, many healthcare providers are first obtaining consent, so that caregivers understand the potential risks and benefits of sildenafil use. Some tertiary care centers are using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tadalafil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tadalafil</a>, a selective type 5 phosphodiesterase inhibitor with a longer half-life than sildenafil. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bosentan-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Bosentan</a> &ndash; Bosentan is an enterally administered endothelin receptor antagonist, used for PAH in adults and for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn.

Steps to minimize risk include avoidance of tobacco smoke exposure and other inhaled irritants, avoidance of relevant environmental allergens, adherence to routine immunization schedule including annual influenza vaccine, and prompt detection and treatment of respiratory infections.

For those who develop asthma-like symptoms, spirometric measures can be used to determine responsiveness to bronchodilators. If the symptoms and spirometric measures are consistent with reactive airways disease, it is appropriate to use standard management techniques for asthma. However, children with BPD are less likely to respond to bronchodilators or steroids than children with asthma.

Infants with extremely low birth weight (ELBW; birth weight &lt;1000 g) are especially vulnerable. (See <a href=\"#H132777273\" class=\"local\">'Respiratory disorders associated with BPD'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the modern era, the most important feature of BPD is impaired alveolar development, with decreased septation and alveolar hypoplasia leading to fewer and larger alveoli and dysmorphic pulmonary vasculature. The lungs often undergo &quot;catch up&quot; alveolar growth throughout infancy and childhood so that many affected individuals develop nearly normal lung function and pulmonary reserve with time. To optimize lung function, it is important to minimize lung injury by avoiding recurrent respiratory infections, minimize feeding-related aspiration, and optimize nutrition, particularly during the first two years of life. (See <a href=\"#H132775746\" class=\"local\">'New versus classic BPD'</a> above and <a href=\"#H132784962\" class=\"local\">'General measures'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent wheezing episodes are common in children and adolescents with a history of BPD, but the underlying pathophysiology differs from asthma. If spirometry suggests obstructive lung disease, a trial of standard asthma-management techniques is appropriate. Bronchodilators are effective in about half of these patients. Similarly, children with BPD may respond to inhaled corticosteroids, but the effect is less consistent than in children with asthma. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Asthma-like symptoms'</a> above and <a href=\"#H132777635\" class=\"local\">'Asthma and asthma-like symptoms'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants with severe BPD may develop PAH. Those who have a need for supplemental oxygen at the time of hospital discharge should be evaluated for PAH using Doppler echocardiography prior to hospital discharge. If PAH is present, these infants should be followed with serial assessment as outpatients. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary artery hypertension'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In infants who were born before the advent of modern neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) management techniques, BPD is typically characterized by airway injury with inflammation and alveolar septal fibrosis, known as &quot;classic&quot; BPD (see <a href=\"#H132775746\" class=\"local\">'New versus classic BPD'</a> above). These changes are usually associated with oxygen toxicity, <span class=\"nowrap\">barotrauma/volutrauma,</span> and infection. These infants may be at greater risk for central airway collapse due to tracheobronchomalacia, which can exacerbate underlying thoracic airway disease associated with BPD and produce &quot;BPD spells&quot; or cyanotic or life-threatening episodes, chronic wheezing unresponsive to bronchodilator therapy, a propensity for atelectasis, and failure to wean from mechanical ventilation or to tolerate tracheal extubation.
