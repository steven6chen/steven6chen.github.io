According to Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) course, shock is further classified into the following stages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-shock-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-classification-of-shock-in-children#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and classification of shock in children&quot;, section on 'Stages of shock'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Compensated shock</strong> &ndash; During compensated shock, the body's homeostatic mechanisms rapidly compensate for diminished perfusion and systolic blood pressure is maintained within the normal range. Heart rate is initially increased. Signs of peripheral vasoconstriction (such as cool skin, decreased peripheral pulses, and oliguria) can be noted as perfusion becomes further compromised.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypotensive shock</strong> &ndash; During this stage, compensatory mechanisms are overwhelmed. Heart rate is markedly elevated and hypotension develops. Signs and symptoms of organ dysfunction (such as altered mental status as the result of poor brain perfusion) appear. Systolic blood pressure falls, although children who have lost as much as 30 to 35 percent of circulating blood volume can typically maintain normal systolic blood pressures. Once hypotension develops, the child's condition usually deteriorates rapidly to cardiovascular collapse and cardiac arrest.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Irreversible shock </strong>&ndash; During this stage, progressive end-organ dysfunction leads to irreversible organ damage and death. Tachycardia may be replaced by bradycardia and blood pressure becomes very low. The process is often irreversible, despite resuscitative efforts.</p><p/><p>In addition to these stages of shock, four broad mechanisms of shock are recognized: hypovolemic, distributive, cardiogenic, and obstructive. Each type is characterized by one primary physiologic derangement as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F73000\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73000 \">table 1</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-classification-of-shock-in-children#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and classification of shock in children&quot;, section on 'Classification'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypovolemic</strong> &ndash; Decreased preload caused by volume loss including hemorrhage, gastrointestinal losses, insensible losses (eg, burns), or third spacing</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Distributive</strong> &ndash; Decreased vascular resistance due to vasodilation caused by conditions such as sepsis, anaphylaxis, or acute injury to the spinal cord or brain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cardiogenic</strong> &ndash; Decreased cardiac contractility caused by conditions such as primary myocardial injury, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, congenital heart disease with heart failure, sepsis, or poisoning</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Obstructive</strong> &ndash; Increased vascular resistance caused by conditions such as congenital heart disease with ductal dependent lesions (eg, hypoplastic left heart), or acquired obstructive conditions (eg, pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade, or massive pulmonary embolism)</p><p/><p>However, a patient may have more than one type of shock (such as an infant with cardiogenic shock from supraventricular tachycardia who is also hypovolemic because he has been unable to drink or a child with underlying cardiomyopathy who is septic). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-of-shock-in-children#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation of shock in children&quot;, section on 'Clinical classification of shock'</a>.)</p><p>An algorithm for identifying the cause of shock is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81356\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef81356 \">algorithm 1</a>). Recognition of shock and classification based upon clinical findings is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-of-shock-in-children#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation of shock in children&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EARLY GOAL-DIRECTED THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early goal-directed therapy for shock refers to an aggressive systematic approach to resuscitation targeted to improvements in physiologic indicators of perfusion and vital organ function within the first six hours. Targeted interventions are determined by degree of illness and response to treatment within the first hour of care. This approach has been most strongly promoted for children with septic shock. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=septic-shock-in-children-rapid-recognition-and-initial-resuscitation-first-hour#H19450185\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Septic shock in children: Rapid recognition and initial resuscitation (first hour)&quot;, section on 'Resuscitation'</a>.)</p><p>Early goal-directed therapy for septic shock in adults is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-sepsis-and-septic-shock-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of suspected sepsis and septic shock in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Physiologic indicators and target goals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physiologic indicators that should be targeted during therapy (with goals in parentheses) include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-shock-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood pressure (systolic pressure at least fifth percentile for age: 60 mmHg &lt;1 month of age, 70 mmHg + [2 x age in years] in children 1 month to 10 years of age, 90 mmHg in children 10 years of age or older)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quality of central and peripheral pulses (strong, distal pulses equal to central pulses)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin perfusion (warm, with capillary refill &lt;2 seconds)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mental status (normal mental status)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine output (&ge;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour, once effective circulating volume is restored)</p><p/><p>Heart rate is an important physiologic indicator of circulatory status. For children with shock, tachycardia is often a compensatory response to poor tissue perfusion. In this situation, a decrease in heart rate with fluid therapy can be a valuable indicator of improved perfusion in response to treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77057\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77057 \">table 2</a>). However, many other factors (ie, fever, drugs, hypoxia, and anxiety) influence heart rate. In addition, an abnormal heart rate may be the direct result of the cause of shock (as with myocarditis or beta blocker ingestion). Although trends in response to treatment should be carefully monitored, specific target goals for heart rate are difficult to define and may not be useful. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-of-shock-in-children#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation of shock in children&quot;, section on 'Circulation'</a>.)</p><p>Elevation of serum or blood lactate (&gt;4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> may help identify the severity of shock at presentation. Although evidence is limited in children, reduction in serum or blood lactate levels have been associated with improved survival in adults with shock. Rapid determination of blood lactate may be obtained at the bedside. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-sepsis-and-septic-shock-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of suspected sepsis and septic shock in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Identifying physiologic indicators to monitor the effectiveness of resuscitation for children with shock is challenging. Parameters that are monitored for adults with sepsis (ie, central venous pressure and central venous oxygen saturation) require central venous catheterization, which can be technically difficult and not always practical or appropriate in children.</p><p>Noninvasive ultrasonic determination of cardiac index, cardiac output, systemic vascular resistance, and stroke volume is feasible in healthy children, and age-based normative values have been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-shock-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Although not widely available, bedside Doppler ultrasound shows promise as a noninvasive method to guide vasoactive therapy by calculating cardiac output (CO) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR) from measurements of blood flow over the pulmonary artery or aorta. As an example, in an observational study of children with fluid-resistant septic shock, this method identified warm shock (high CO, low SVR) and cold shock (low to normal CO, high SVR) in 30 children and correlated these shock states with the underlying diagnosis; warm shock in children with central venous catheter related sepsis (15 of 16 patients) and cold shock in those patients with community acquired sepsis (12 of 14 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-shock-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Several physiologic indicators can be readily monitored noninvasively during the initial management of shock and, since many children in shock respond well, invasive monitoring can often be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-shock-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Mean arterial pressure can be measured with a blood pressure cuff. Clinical experience suggests that the quality of central and peripheral pulses, skin perfusion, mental status, and urine output are useful signs for assessing response to therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-shock-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Limited observational evidence suggests that capillary refill time may correlate with mixed central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO<sub>2</sub>), an invasive measurement of tissue oxygen extraction. In a prospective study of 21 critically ill children, the majority of whom had septic shock, a central capillary refill time &le;2 seconds had a sensitivity of 84 percent and a positive predictive value of 50 percent for a ScvO<sub>2</sub> &ge;70 percent suggesting that cardiac output was providing adequate tissue perfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-shock-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Fluid administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limited evidence exists concerning the optimal amount and rate of fluid administration for children with shock. Several studies support the use of isotonic crystalloid fluid bolus (ie, normal saline or Ringers Lactate) as a component of goal-directed therapy for shock other than obstructive shock (eg, tension pneumothorax, pericardial tamponade, or massive pulmonary embolus). However, aggressive fluid resuscitation may be harmful for children who are not hypovolemic or have compensated shock with certain comorbidities (eg, cardiac disease, diabetic ketoacidosis [DKA], syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion [SIADH], severe malnutrition, or malaria). Patients with obstructive shock should receive emergent correction of the underlying cause (eg, needle or chest tube thoracostomy for tension pneumothorax or pericardiocentesis for cardiac tamponade). Neonates with ductal dependent lesions and circulatory collapse may also be hypovolemic. However, primary treatment should focus on reopening the ductus arteriosus with prostaglandin E<sub>1</sub> (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=alprostadil-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">alprostadil</a>). (See <a href=\"#H22059037\" class=\"local\">'Evidence for goal-directed therapy in children'</a> below and <a href=\"#H22060512\" class=\"local\">'Risks'</a> below and <a href=\"#H12008530\" class=\"local\">'Obstructive shock'</a> below.)</p><p>The etiology and degree of shock determines the volume and rate of initial fluid resuscitation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F73000\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73000 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-shock-in-children/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>] (see <a href=\"#H15712116\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypotensive hypovolemic or distributive shock </strong>&ndash; We recommend that children with hypotensive hypovolemic or distributive shock (as from gastrointestinal losses, traumatic hemorrhage, sepsis, or anaphylaxis), receive 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per bolus of isotonic crystalloid, such as normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution, infused over 5 to 10 minutes and repeated, as needed, up to four times in patients without improvement and <strong>no</strong> signs of fluid overload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-shock-in-children/abstract/2,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,7</a>]. Additional therapies, such as blood transfusion in patients with hypovolemic shock from hemorrhage or vasoactive drug therapy and corticosteroid administration in patients with septic shock may be required depending upon the response to fluid administration. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Hypovolemic shock'</a> below and <a href=\"#H12008250\" class=\"local\">'Distributive shock'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Observational studies of rapid fluid resuscitation as a component of goal-directed therapy and in conjunction with other critical care interventions such as prophylactic endotracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation and close monitoring by pediatric critical care specialists has been associated with a marked decrease in mortality, especially in children with hypotensive septic shock. (See <a href=\"#H22059037\" class=\"local\">'Evidence for goal-directed therapy in children'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Techniques to rapidly deliver intravenous fluid include gravity, applying pressure directly to the bag of fluid with an inflatable device, delivering aliquots of fluid using a large syringe that is refilled through a three-way stopcock attached to the bag (the &quot;push-pull&quot; method) or use of rapid infusion pumps designed to deliver high volumes of warmed fluids or blood. Gravity alone is likely insufficient to deliver 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> over 5 to 10 minutes. This was demonstrated in a randomized trial that compared the rate at which fluid could be delivered to 57 children requiring fluid resuscitation using gravity, an inflatable pressure bag, or a &quot;push-pull&quot; method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-shock-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The median volume of fluid delivered over five minutes by gravity was 6.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg,</span> in comparison to 20.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> for the pressure bag and 20.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> for the &quot;push-pull&quot; method. These differences remained significant after controlling for intravenous catheter gauge, age, and weight.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Compensated hypovolemic or distributive shock </strong>&ndash; We suggest that children with compensated hypovolemic or distributive shock receive 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per bolus of isotonic crystalloid, such as normal saline or Ringer's lactate solution over 5 to 20 minutes. Patients should be closely monitored during fluid administration. Additional fluid boluses may be indicated depending upon the patients&rsquo; response. Evidence suggests that overly aggressive fluid bolus may be harmful in selected patients, including those with cardiogenic shock, DKA, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, severe malnutrition, or, in resource-limited settings, severe febrile illness in the absence of dehydration or hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"#H22060512\" class=\"local\">'Risks'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cardiogenic shock </strong>&ndash; For suspected cardiogenic shock in patients with signs such as a gallop rhythm, pulmonary rales, jugular venous distension, or hepatomegaly, a smaller isotonic crystalloid fluid bolus of 5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg,</span> infused over 10 to 20 minutes decreases the likelihood of exacerbating heart failure. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Cardiogenic shock'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diabetic ketoacidosis</strong> &ndash; Children with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) should receive careful fluid resuscitation (one bolus of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg,</span> maximum 1 L, infused over one hour) in order to avoid cerebral edema, a rare complication of DKA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-complications-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and complications of diabetic ketoacidosis in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Cerebral edema'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Severe febrile illness in resource-limited settings</strong> &ndash; Children with severe febrile illness without dehydration or hemorrhage and with normal blood pressure who reside in resource-limited settings, where aggressive monitoring, endotracheal intubation with mechanical ventilation, and vasopressor therapies are <strong>not</strong> available, and who have no signs of dehydration or hemorrhage should <strong>not</strong> receive boluses of isotonic fluid. This approach is associated with increased mortality when compared with blood transfusion and maintenance fluid therapy alone.

Clinical findings of cardiogenic shock include gallop rhythm, jugular venous distension, pulmonary rales, and hepatomegaly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Severe anemia</strong> &ndash; Rapid fluid administration in children with hemoglobin levels below 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> may further dilute the hemoglobin concentration, impair oxygen delivery, and precipitate heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-shock-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Blood transfusion is the preferred therapy in such patients, although careful fluid administration may be acceptable if transfusion is delayed. As an example, in a small trial of 38 children with severe falciparum malaria (hemoglobin &lt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL),</span> administration of 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of isotonic saline or 4.5 percent albumin versus maintenance fluid therapy only while waiting for blood transfusion did not cause congestive heart failure and resulted in significantly less need for emergency interventions (0 versus 22 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-shock-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH)</strong> &ndash; Aggressive fluid therapy in the absence of hypovolemia can cause cerebral edema in patients with meningitis and adult respiratory distress syndrome in patients with pneumonia as a result of fluid overload caused by SIADH. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-the-syndrome-of-inappropriate-antidiuretic-hormone-secretion-siadh#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and etiology of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH)&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) </strong>&ndash; Cerebral edema, a rare complication of DKA, usually develops during treatment and has been associated with rapid administration of fluids. However, cerebral edema may also occur in optimally managed patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-complications-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and complications of diabetic ketoacidosis in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Cerebral edema'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Severe malnutrition</strong> &ndash; Intravenous fluid resuscitation in children with severe malnutrition and signs of shock is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-shock-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Sunken eyes, lethargy, and tenting may occur from malnutrition alone and can cause clinicians to overestimate the degree of dehydration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-shock-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Some experts believe that malnutrition causes sodium and water retention, overexpansion of the extracellular fluid, and myocardial dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-shock-in-children/abstract/11,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13-15</a>]. Thus, rapid administration of intravenous fluids to infants and children who do not have fluid depletion or physiologic changes associated with severe malnutrition or both may risk fluid overload, heart failure, and pulmonary edema and is not recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-shock-in-children/abstract/12,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, evidence suggests that the WHO recommendations for fluid resuscitation in severely malnourished may be too restrictive. For example, in an observational study of fluid resuscitation in 149 severely malnourished children with cholera and severe dehydration, infusion of approximately 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour of an isotonic saline solution over four to six hours was not associated with heart failure in any patient, and all patients survived [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-shock-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Furthermore, in a clinical trial of 61 children with severe malnutrition accompanied by decompensated shock in the majority of patients, administration of 30 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of crystalloid fluids over two hours failed to reverse shock in over half of patients and was accompanied by high mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-shock-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Thus, pending further study, some experts suggest that severely malnourished children receive fluid resuscitation with careful reassessment according to the WHO guidelines for children with shock and no signs of malnutrition. (See <a href=\"#H12495758\" class=\"local\">'Resource-limited settings'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In resource-limited settings that cannot provide advanced airway and circulatory support, bolus administration of albumin or normal saline may be associated with increased mortality for children with signs of shock and severe febrile illness but without dehydration or hemorrhage.

Delayed fluid resuscitation with controlled hypotension may be beneficial for selected patients with penetrating injuries (eg, gunshot or stab wounds) to the torso when rapid access to emergency surgery with control of the bleeding source is possible. However, limited evidence supports this approach and the decision to implement delayed fluid resuscitation of hypotension should be made jointly with the trauma surgeon.

(See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Life-threatening conditions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the initial management of children with shock, other than obstructive shock, who are cared for in a setting with critical care capability, we suggest early goal-directed therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77079\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef77079 \">algorithm 2</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Physiologic indicators that should be targeted include central and peripheral pulses, skin perfusion, mental status, blood pressure, and urine output (once effective circulating volume is restored). Physiologic indicators should be frequently assessed. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Goal-directed approach'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The etiology and degree of shock determines the volume and rate of initial fluid resuscitation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F73000\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73000 \">table 1</a>) (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Fluid administration'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We recommend that children with <strong>hypotensive </strong>hypovolemic or distributive shock (as from gastrointestinal losses, traumatic hemorrhage, sepsis, or anaphylaxis), receive 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per bolus of isotonic crystalloid, such as normal saline or Ringers Lactate solution, infused over 5 to 10 minutes and repeated, as needed, up to four times in patients without improvement and <strong>no</strong> signs of fluid overload (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>).

This approach decreases the likelihood of exacerbating heart failure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Children with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) should receive careful fluid resuscitation (one bolus of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg,</span> maximum 1 L, infused over one hour) in order to avoid cerebral edema, a rare complication of DKA.

We recommend that children in resource-limited settings who have severe febrile illnesses without dehydration or hemorrhage and with normal blood pressures <strong>not</strong> receive boluses of isotonic fluid (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Choice of fluid'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional care includes establishing a secure airway and assessing for and treating life-threatening conditions (ie, upper airway obstruction, tension pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade, and unstable tachycardia).

Children who have not improved following the rapid infusion of 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of crystalloid should be carefully reevaluated. We suggest that those with nontraumatic hypovolemic shock who have capillary leak or hypoalbuminemia and do not respond to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of crystalloid receive colloid therapy or blood products (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Children with hemorrhagic shock who do not respond to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of crystalloid should receive blood.
