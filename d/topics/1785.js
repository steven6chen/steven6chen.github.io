Barrier contraceptives include the condom, diaphragm, and cervical cap. These methods:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have fewer side effects than hormonal contraceptives</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Offer effective protection against certain sexually transmitted diseases (STDs)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are available without a prescription (condom and spermicides)</p><p/><p>Spermicides are chemical substances that destroy sperm. They come in different forms (including gels, creams, films, and a sponge), are available without a prescription. Using a spermicide in combination with a barrier method maximizes the contraceptive effect. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Spermicide'</a> below.)</p><p>This topic discusses barrier methods of birth control, including the condom, diaphragm, cervical cap, sponge, and spermicides. A discussion of hormonal and long-term birth control methods is available separately.

(Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOOSING A BIRTH CONTROL METHOD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It can be difficult to decide which birth control method is best due to the variety of options available. The best method is one that will be used consistently, is acceptable to the woman and her partner, and which does not cause bothersome side effects. Other factors to consider include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Efficacy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Convenience</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duration of action</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reversibility and time to return of fertility</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Effect on uterine bleeding</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frequency of side effects and adverse events</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Affordability</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Protection against sexually transmitted diseases</p><p/><p>No method of contraception is perfect. Each woman must balance the advantages of each method against the disadvantages and decide which method she prefers. A list of questions that are useful for defining a person's preferences are provided in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F67965\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67965 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Emergency contraception (EC, also known as postcoital contraception or the morning-after pill) refers to the use of drugs to prevent pregnancy in women who have had recent unprotected intercourse (including sexual assault), or who have had a failure of another method of contraception (eg, broken condom). Since barrier methods can have high failure rates in couples during typical use, it is recommended that couples choosing these methods have a supply of emergency contraceptive available at home to use if needed (condom breakage, forgot to use method). Emergency contraception is discussed in detail in a separate topic (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-contraception-morning-after-pill-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Emergency contraception (morning after pill) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CONDOMS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Male condom</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Male condoms are a thin, flexible sheath or cover that is placed over the erect penis to prevent semen from entering the partner's body during sexual intercourse. To help ensure optimal effectiveness and protection, people who use condoms must carefully follow instructions for their use.</p><p>Spermicidal condoms (those that are packaged with spermicide applied to the condom) are no more effective and expire faster than condoms without spermicide, and therefore are not recommended. It is better to use another form of spermicide instead.</p><p>When used properly, condoms can also reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections such as HIV. Studies have found the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a decreased risk of gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomonas, syphilis, HIV, and HPV (human papillomavirus, which can cause genital warts and cervical cancer) in women whose male partner consistently uses condoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genital-warts-in-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Genital warts in women (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-cancer-screening-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Cervical cancer screening (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testing-for-hiv-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Testing for HIV (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of HIV-negative women whose only risk for infection was a stable relationship with an HIV-infected man, none of the women who consistently used condoms became infected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regular use of latex condoms appears to decrease the risk of HIV infection by about 69 percent.</p><p/><p>Oil-based lubricants (eg, suntan oil, petroleum jelly, whipped cream) should not be used with latex condoms because this can cause breakage of the condom. Water-based lubricants are safe (eg, K-Y, Astroglide).</p><p>Most condoms are made of latex, which can be a problem for people who have an allergy or sensitivity to latex. Polyurethane condoms are available as an alternative to latex. Animal skin condoms (eg, lambskin) are not recommended when there is a risk of HIV infection because they do not effectively prevent transmission of HIV. </p><p>When couples use condoms perfectly, only two women out of 100 will become pregnant during the first year of use. However, since couples may not use condoms every time they have intercourse, with typical use, 18 women out of 100 will become pregnant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Female condom</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The female condom is worn by a woman to prevent semen from entering the vagina. It is a sheath made of nitrile and is prelubricated with a silicone-based lubricant. There is a soft, flexible ring at each end (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F59955\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59955 \">picture 1</a>). The edges of the ring at the closed end of the sheath are squeezed together and then inserted as far as possible into the vagina; upon release, the ring will open to hold the condom in place. The ring at the open end of the sheath remains outside the vulva, resting against the labia. The woman should check to make sure the condom is not twisted.</p><p>When couples use female condoms perfectly, only five women out of 100 will become pregnant during the first year of use. However, with typical use, 21 women out of 100 will become pregnant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAPHRAGM/CERVICAL CAP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diaphragm or cervical cap is placed over the cervix before intercourse. Pregnancy is prevented by blocking sperm from entering the uterus and killing sperm with the spermicide (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Spermicide'</a> below). Both require fitting by a trained clinician, and the fit should be checked after childbirth and weight loss or gain of more than 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms). A new diaphragm, called Caya, does not need to be fitted as it comes in one size for everyone to use. </p><p>Both devices can decrease the risk of certain sexually transmitted diseases and infections, including gonorrhea, chlamydia, and pelvic inflammatory disease. However, the diaphragm and cervical cap are less effective than condoms in preventing the spread of HIV infection. Diaphragms and cervical caps are not recommended for women at high risk for HIV, who are HIV infected, or who have AIDS as they do not appear to prevent transmission of the virus.</p><p>In most studies, the failure rate (number of pregnancies) was higher for users of the diaphragm or cervical cap compared to hormonal methods of birth control (eg, the birth control pill).</p><p>When couples use the diaphragm perfectly, only six women out of 100 will become pregnant during the first year of use. However, with typical use, 12 women out of 100 will become pregnant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Diaphragm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diaphragm is a soft dome-shaped cup made of latex rubber or silicone with a flexible rim. Before intercourse, the hollow of the dome is partially filled with a spermicidal cream or jelly and then the diaphragm is inserted deep into the vagina and positioned so that it fits over the cervix (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F50226\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50226 \">picture 2</a>). It must be left in place for six to eight hours after sexual intercourse, and then should be removed. If the woman has sex more than once during this time, an additional dose of spermicide should be inserted into the vagina.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Precautions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women can use the diaphragm; however; it is not a good method for those who have an <span class=\"nowrap\">allergy/sensitivity</span> to latex, silicone, or spermicides; significant pelvic relaxation (uterine prolapse, cystocele, rectocele, poor vaginal tone); frequent urinary tract infections; HIV infection or high risk for acquiring HIV; or difficulty with the insertion process. Women with a history of toxic shock syndrome should not use a diaphragm. In some women, use of a diaphragm increases risk of urinary tract infections. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical cap</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cervical cap is available in latex (the Prentif cap) or silicone rubber (FemCap) in multiple sizes. Similar to the diaphragm, it is partially filled with spermicide and placed over the cervix. It can remain in place for up to 48 hours.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">SPONGE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The contraceptive sponge blocks sperm from entering the uterus and contains a spermicide to kill sperm. It can be purchased without a prescription (brand name: Today).</p><p>The sponge is a two-inch wide circular disk that is <span class=\"nowrap\">3/4</span> of an inch thick and attached to a loop that is used for removal. It contains a spermicide, and is moistened with tap water before insertion deep in the vagina.</p><p>The sponge can be left in place and used repeatedly for up to 24 hours. </p><p>When women with no previous births use the sponge perfectly, 9 out of 100 will become pregnant during the first year of use. With typical use, 12 women out of 100 will become pregnant. The failure rate is higher in women with previous births.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">SPERMICIDE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spermicides are chemical substances that destroy sperm. They are available in most pharmacies without a prescription. Spermicides are available in a variety of forms including gel, foam, cream, film, suppository, and tablet.</p><p>Spermicides may be used alone, but are more effective when used in combination with a condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap. Effectiveness is reduced if a couple does not wait long enough for the spermicide to disperse before having intercourse, if intercourse is delayed for more than one hour after administration, or if a repeat dose is not applied before each additional act of intercourse.</p><p>Local irritation of the vagina is not uncommon with spermicide use, and spermicide-coated condoms are associated with an increased risk of urinary tract infection in the female partner. In the United States, the only spermicide available is nonoxynol-9; use of this spermicide alone is not effective in preventing transmission of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.</p><p>When couples use a spermicide alone perfectly, 18 women out of 100 will become pregnant during the first year of use. With typical use, 28 women out of 100 will become pregnant. When a spermicide is used with another contraceptive method, such as a condom or diaphragm, the number of women who become pregnant is much lower.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our web site (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=8422\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
