Answer these questions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have you lost control of your drinking? For example, do you sometimes find that you drink more than you meant to?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do you need to drink larger and larger amounts to get the effect you want? Or do you get sick or feel physically uncomfortable if you cut down on your drinking?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have you lost your job, gotten in trouble with the law, or had problems with your friends or family because of alcohol?</p><p/><p>If you said yes to any of these questions, or if you just think you have a problem, mention it to your doctor or nurse. He or she can help you find out if you do have a drinking problem. Do not be embarrassed to talk with him or her about it. Alcohol problems are common. But there are treatments that can help.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H38470291\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens if I keep drinking too much?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People who drink too much can get serious liver and heart disease. They can get different types of cancer. And they can damage their brain. Plus, people who drink too much are more likely than people who do not to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have car accidents</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kill themselves</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drown</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Be seriously hurt</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5140911\"><span class=\"h1\">What is alcohol use disorder?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alcohol use disorder is basically the medical term for alcoholism or alcohol addiction. People who have alcohol addiction have 2 or more of the following problems. The more of these they have, the more severe their disorder.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They end up drinking more alcohol than they planned to or for a longer time than they planned to.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They wish they could cut down on alcohol, but they can't.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They spend a lot of time trying to get alcohol, getting drunk, or recovering from being drunk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They crave or have a strong desire or urge to drink alcohol.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because of their alcohol use, they often don't do things that are expected of them, such as go to work or school, remember family events, and clean their home.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They keep drinking even if it causes or worsens problems in their relationships or interactions with other people.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They stop or cut back on important social, work, or fun activities they used to do.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They keep drinking alcohol even in situations where it is dangerous to do so (such as while driving).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They keep drinking alcohol even when they know they have a physical or mental problem that was probably caused or made worse by their drinking.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They need to drink more and more to get the same effects they used to get with less. Or they get less effect from using the amount that used to get them drunk. This is called &quot;tolerance.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They have &quot;withdrawal symptoms&quot; if they stop drinking alcohol after drinking for a long time. Withdrawal symptoms can include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sweating or a racing heart</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hand trembling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Insomnia (not being able to sleep)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Nausea or vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Seeing, feeling, or hearing things that aren't really there (these are called &quot;hallucinations&quot;)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Being restless</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Anxiety</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Seizures (these can be serious, even life-threatening)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H38470298\"><span class=\"h1\">What treatments can help?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People who have problems with alcohol can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>See a counselor (such as a psychologist, social worker, or psychiatrist)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take medicines</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take part in a support group such as Alcoholics Anonymous (sometimes called AA)</p><p/><p>All of these treatments can help, and they can be combined.</p><p>There are a few different medicines doctors and nurses can use to treat alcohol problems. These medicines work in different ways. They can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Change the way your brain responds to alcohol so that it is less fun</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduce your craving for alcohol</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make you feel sick if you do drink</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Help you feel less sick when you stop drinking</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H38470305\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I stop drinking on my own?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people get over their drinking problem on their own. But people with who have been drinking several days a week for weeks in a row should not try to cut down without the help of a doctor or nurse. People who drink that much can die if they stop or cut down on drinking too quickly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H38470368\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=alcohol-poisoning-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Alcohol poisoning (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=alcohol-withdrawal-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Alcohol withdrawal (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=alcohol-and-drug-use-in-pregnancy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Alcohol and drug use in pregnancy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-alcohol-syndrome-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Fetal alcohol syndrome (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cirrhosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cirrhosis (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=alcohol-use-when-is-drinking-a-problem-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Alcohol use &mdash; when is drinking a problem?
