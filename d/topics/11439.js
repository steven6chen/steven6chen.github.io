When people have myoclonus, their muscles jerk, twitch, spasm, or shake.</p><p>Myoclonus can affect different parts of the body. It can affect the whole body at once, or just one part, such as a leg or foot.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16566978\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes myoclonus?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myoclonus can be caused by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A disease that damages the brain and nervous system, such as Parkinson disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An injury or condition that keeps the brain from getting enough oxygen</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epilepsy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diseases that affect certain organs or glands in the body &ndash; These include liver failure, kidney failure, and overactive thyroid.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A bad reaction to medicines or chemicals</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A condition called &quot;essential myoclonus&quot; &ndash; In this condition, myoclonus is the most obvious symptom or the only symptom.</p><p/><p>Some myoclonus is normal in healthy people. For example, many people have a sudden muscle twitch or jerk when they are falling asleep. Sometimes, the whole body jerks. Movements or twitches that happen during sleep can also be myoclonus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16566993\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. See a doctor or nurse if you start having muscle spasms or twitches you cannot control.</p><p>If you have epilepsy and your seizures change or get worse, see your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16567008\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. Your doctor or nurse will talk with you and do an exam. He or she will decide which tests you should have based on your age, other symptoms, and situation. There are lots of tests, but you might not need any.</p><p>The most common tests for myoclonus are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood and urine tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EEG &ndash; This test measures electrical activity in the brain and records brain wave patterns.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brain or spine imaging tests &ndash; These tests create pictures of the inside of the body. These tests include CT scans and MRIs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lumbar puncture (also called a &quot;spinal tap&quot;) &ndash; For this test, a doctor puts a thin needle in the lower back and removes a small amount of spinal fluid. Spinal fluid is the fluid around the brain and spinal cord. Another doctor will do lab tests on the spinal fluid.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EMG &ndash; This test measures electrical activity in the muscles. It shows whether the muscles are responding the right way to electrical signals.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16567023\"><span class=\"h1\">How is myoclonus treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on what is causing the myoclonus. If it is caused by a condition doctors can cure, such as a disease or tumor, doctors will treat that condition. This can make myoclonus get better or go away.</p><p>But myoclonus is often caused by conditions that doctors cannot cure. This can make it very hard or impossible to get rid of myoclonus.</p><p>Doctors can try different treatments. These help some people feel better. In general, these treatments work by blocking or calming the nerve signals that make the muscles jerk or twitch. Treatments include medicines normally used to control seizures and shots of a medicine called &quot;botulinum toxin.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16567038\"><span class=\"h1\">What if my child gets myoclonus?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your baby or child starts having muscle twitches or spasms, take him or her to see a doctor or nurse. If your child has epilepsy and the seizures get worse or change, talk to his or her doctor.</p><p>Some children get a type of myoclonus that can run in families. It is not usually serious. Children with this condition just have myoclonus, not another problem that is causing myoclonus. For them, the muscle jerks and spasms usually start around age 4 to 8 years, but the symptoms can start later.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16567053\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Seizures (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=epilepsy-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Epilepsy in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tremor-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Tremor (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Seizures in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Seizures in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tremor-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Tremor (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
