There are several types of encephalitis that are immune-mediated, including the classic paraneoplastic encephalitis syndromes and the encephalitis syndromes associated with antibodies against neuronal cell <span class=\"nowrap\">surface/synaptic</span> proteins. The latter are often referred to as autoimmune encephalitis.</p><p>While the paraneoplastic encephalitis syndromes are invariably cancer-related, the autoimmune encephalitis syndromes may occur in the presence or absence of cancer. Thus, nomenclature can be confusing, as the paraneoplastic encephalitis syndromes are autoimmune, and autoimmune encephalitis may be paraneoplastic. In this topic, the term autoimmune encephalitis refers specifically to those syndromes that are associated with antibodies to neuronal cell <span class=\"nowrap\">surface/synaptic</span> proteins. &#160;</p><p>An overview of paraneoplastic syndromes and other paraneoplastic disorders are discussed separately.

In the majority of cases, symptoms have an acute to subacute onset, and evaluation of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) often shows abnormalities such as pleocytosis, increased protein concentration, oligoclonal bands, and elevated immunoglobulin G (IgG) index, suggesting an inflammatory process. In more than half of patients, the neurologic syndrome develops before the cancer diagnosis is known.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3370754\"><span class=\"h3\">Limbic encephalitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limbic encephalitis refers to an inflammatory process localized to structures of the limbic system (eg, hippocampus, amygdala, hypothalamus, cingulate gyrus, limbic cortex), although the pathologic, clinical and radiological findings are often not confined to these areas. Limbic encephalitis is considered a classical paraneoplastic syndrome, defined as a disorder that is commonly due to a paraneoplastic process. However, as noted below, limbic encephalitis is the main manifestation of several of the autoimmune encephalitis syndromes that may occur without a cancer association. (See <a href=\"#H100460916\" class=\"local\">'Autoimmune encephalitis'</a> below.) &#160; &#160;</p><p>Limbic encephalitis is characterized by acute or subacute mood and behavioral changes, short-term memory problems, focal seizures with impaired awareness (complex partial seizures), and cognitive dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Hypothalamic dysfunction may also occur with manifestations such as hyperthermia, somnolence, and endocrine abnormalities. Symptoms typically evolve over days to weeks, but more indolent presentations over months have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Electroencephalographic (EEG) findings include focal or generalized slowing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> epileptiform activity, which is maximal in the temporal regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may show areas of <span class=\"nowrap\">T2/fluid-attenuated</span> inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensity in the medial temporal lobes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F111081\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef111081 \">image 1</a>); contrast enhancement in these regions is very infrequent. Positron emission tomography (PET) may demonstrate hypermetabolism in the medial temporal lobes; later in the course of disease, hypometabolism may be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>MRI findings in the medial temporal lobes are reasonably sensitive but not specific for limbic encephalitis. Approximately 80 percent of patients with symptoms of limbic encephalitis, in whom the diagnosis is eventually confirmed during the course of disease, will have uni- or bilateral increased FLAIR signal in the medial temporal lobes on MRI. The other patients may show late changes or no changes on MRI.</p><p>The most frequent neoplasms associated with paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis are cancer of the lung (usually small-cell lung cancer [SCLC]), seminoma and other testicular tumors, thymoma, breast cancer, and Hodgkin lymphoma. Neurologic symptoms typically precede discovery of the tumor by weeks or months. </p><p>The type of associated autoantibody varies with tumor type (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F77919\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77919 \">table 1</a>). With SCLC, most patients have anti-Hu (also known as antineuronal nuclear antibody type 1, ANNA-1) or <span class=\"nowrap\">CV2/CRMP5</span> antibodies in their serum and CSF, and they are more likely to develop other manifestations of paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. Response to treatment can be dramatic but is highly variable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3372592\"><span class=\"h3\">Brainstem encephalitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Paraneoplastic brainstem dysfunction often occurs during the course of other paraneoplastic syndromes, such as limbic encephalitis, cerebellar degeneration, or encephalomyelitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In some patients, however, the neurologic symptoms and pathologic findings (such as perivascular and interstitial inflammatory infiltrates, gliosis, and loss of neurons) appear restricted to the brainstem (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F60351\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60351 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The term rhombencephalitis is sometimes used to denote inflammatory conditions affecting the lower brainstem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>A wide spectrum of symptoms localized to the pons <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> medulla can develop in these patients, including supranuclear, internuclear, and nuclear extraocular movement deficits, opsoclonus, nystagmus, dysphagia, dysarthria, sensorineural deafness, trigeminal sensory loss, central hypoventilation, and vertigo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/5,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8,9</a>]. </p><p>Any of the antibodies seen in paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis can be associated with predominant brainstem dysfunction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F77919\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77919 \">table 1</a>). Anti-Hu antibodies are more often associated with lower brainstem involvement, while anti-Ma2 antibodies commonly associate with upper brainstem findings.</p><p>Many different underlying tumors have been identified. Patients with SCLC typically have anti-Hu antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/5,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9</a>], while most patients with testicular cancer have anti-Ma2 antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Anti-Hu brainstem encephalitis has also been described in association with breast cancer, renal cell carcinoma, prostate adenocarcinoma, and rarely, in patients who appear cancer-free [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H397876930\"><span class=\"h3\">Encephalomyelitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis is characterized by involvement of several areas of the nervous system, including the temporal-limbic regions, brainstem, cerebellum, spinal cord, dorsal root ganglia, and autonomic nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The distribution of disease and symptoms varies.</p><p>Pathologic examination usually reveals perivascular and interstitial inflammatory infiltrates of T lymphocytes, gliosis, neuronophagic nodules, and loss of neurons. In addition to T cell infiltrates, B cells preferentially cluster around vessels and may be associated with plasma cell infiltrates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. The findings are typically more extensive than symptoms would suggest and may involve any area of the central nervous system, dorsal root ganglia, or autonomic neurons.</p><p>Most patients with paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis have anti-Hu antibodies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F77919\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77919 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/5,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13,14</a>]. These antibodies are directed against neuron specific RNA-binding nuclear proteins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F56327\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56327 \">picture 2</a>) and are associated with paraneoplastic sensory neuronopathy as well as encephalomyelitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/5,13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13,15</a>]. The expression of the target antigens is highly restricted to the nervous system and the tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-peripheral-nerve-and-muscle#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paraneoplastic syndromes affecting peripheral nerve and muscle&quot;, section on 'Peripheral nerve syndromes'</a>.)</p><p>Virtually all cancer types have been associated with paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis or its variants (limbic encephalitis, brainstem encephalitis, myelitis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. However, the underlying tumor is SCLC in approximately 75 percent of patients. This has been confirmed in four large series comprising over 500 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/5,13,14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13,14,16</a>]. The tumor is frequently undiagnosed at the time that the neurologic syndrome develops and may be difficult to demonstrate because of its small size. This stands in direct contrast to the fact that most SCLCs (over 60 percent) are widely metastatic at diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathobiology-and-staging-of-small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-lung\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathobiology and staging of small cell carcinoma of the lung&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3446246481\"><span class=\"h3\">Myelitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Paraneoplastic myelitis occurs as part of encephalomyelitis, usually in association with SCLC. Patients often develop sensory neuronopathy (eg, involvement of the dorsal root ganglia) as well and have anti-Hu antibodies in their serum and CSF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Motor neuron syndromes are also described.</p><p>Sensory neuronopathy differs from the usual peripheral neuropathy in that the sensory loss is not distal and symmetrical and may involve proximal areas such as the face and trunk. Limb ataxia is often prominent due to early loss of vibratory and position sensation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-the-spinal-cord-and-dorsal-root-ganglia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paraneoplastic syndromes affecting the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3372409\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific antibody-associated syndromes</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3373108\"><span class=\"h3\">Anti-Hu encephalomyelitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anti-Hu paraneoplastic syndromes are often multifocal, affecting temporal lobes, brainstem, cerebellum, dorsal roots, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> autonomic nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/1,5,13,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,13,16</a>]. In many patients, symptoms begin with, and may remain restricted, to the dorsal root ganglia, causing a subacute sensory neuronopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/5,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-the-spinal-cord-and-dorsal-root-ganglia#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paraneoplastic syndromes affecting the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia&quot;, section on 'Subacute sensory neuronopathy'</a>.) &#160;</p><p>Other patients with anti-Hu antibodies present with a more restricted brainstem or limbic encephalitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/5,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9</a>]. A presentation with nonconvulsive seizures has been described in several case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3370754\" class=\"local\">'Limbic encephalitis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3372592\" class=\"local\">'Brainstem encephalitis'</a> above.)</p><p>SCLC is found in most patients with anti-Hu encephalitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/1,13,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13,16</a>]. Some patients have other cancer-types; no cancer is found in approximately 15 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/13,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16</a>]. In a few patients, a cancer has been demonstrated and apparently eradicated by the immune response. In children, the likelihood of an autoimmune, rather than paraneoplastic, encephalitis appears to be higher; in one referral-based cohort, six of eight children with anti-Hu encephalitis were cancer-free compared with none of 243 adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Early recognition of anti-Hu encephalomyelitis and prompt antitumor treatment are important in stabilizing or sometimes improving the neurologic symptoms. In one series of 200 patients with paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis and anti-Hu antibodies, antitumor treatment was associated with a significantly greater likelihood of neurologic improvement or stabilization (odds ratio, 4.6) and a lower mortality rate (relative risk of death with no antitumor treatment 2.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Immunotherapy (eg, corticosteroids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a>, plasma exchange, etc.), either given with antitumor treatment or alone, has also been associated with stabilization in a smaller proportion of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/16,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,22</a>]. One report describes improvement with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> in two patients with paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis associated with the anti-Hu antibody [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In children, the syndrome appears to be more treatment-resistant and associated with long term sequelae of intractable epilepsy and cognitive impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Neurologic dysfunction is a frequent cause of death, particularly when there is brainstem and autonomic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, prolonged survival can occur in association with regression of the tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/13,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,24</a>]. Neurologic function rarely improves spontaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3370761\"><span class=\"h3\">Ma2-associated encephalitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testicular cancer is associated with anti-Ma2 (also called anti-Ta) antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The Ma2 antigen is selectively expressed in neurons and the testicular tumor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F56327\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56327 \">picture 2</a>). Ma2 shares homology with Ma1, a gene that is associated with other paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes, particularly brainstem and cerebellar dysfunction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F77919\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77919 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/12,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,26</a>].</p><p>The clinical presentation of anti-Ma2 associated encephalitis differs from classic paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis. In a series of 38 patients with anti-Ma2 encephalitis, 34 (89 percent) developed isolated or combined limbic (n = 27), diencephalic (n = 13), or brainstem encephalopathy (n = 25) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. MRI abnormalities were frequent in these brain regions, and inflammatory changes were typically present in the CSF. Four patients developed other syndromes, including two with a predominant cerebellar ataxia that remained stable for several years, and two with myelopathy.</p><p>Other prominent neurologic features included excessive daytime sleepiness and eye movement abnormalities, particularly a vertical gaze paresis that sometimes evolved to total external ophthalmoplegia. Three patients developed atypical parkinsonism, and two developed a severe hypokinetic syndrome. An additional case report describes an individual whose syndrome included amyotrophy of the upper extremities with an associated cervical cord lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Testicular germ cell tumors are the most common associated neoplasms, identified in 18 of 34 patients found to have cancer in the above described series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Orchiectomy may be required to reveal microscopic testicular germ cell neoplasia, as occurred in six men (age 26 to 40 years) with Ma2-associated encephalitis and no evidence of other cancer by rigorous testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. All six men were identified to be at risk for testicular cancer because of new testicular enlargement, testicular microcalcifications, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cryptorchidism. Extragonadal germ cell tumors have also been described in association with this syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. The diagnosis of testicular germ cell tumors is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-testicular-germ-cell-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of testicular germ cell tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Coexisting antibodies to Ma1 were seen in 15 of 34 patients with anti-Ma2 encephalitis and were significantly more common in patients with tumors other than testicular cancer (usually lung cancer) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Compared with patients with antibodies only to Ma2, these patients are also more likely to develop ataxia and to have a worse prognosis.</p><p>Anti-Ma2 associated encephalitis is more responsive to oncologic and immunologic treatment than other types of paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In the series cited above, neurologic improvement or stabilization occurred in 18 of 33 patients with outcome information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Features significantly associated with improvement or stabilization included male sex, age 45 years or less, testicular tumour with complete response to treatment, absence of anti-Ma1 antibodies, and limited CNS involvement. However, a positive treatment response can occur in other patients as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5281280\"><span class=\"h3\">Anti-CRMP5 encephalomyelitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibodies to a collapsin-responsive mediator protein-5 (CRMP5) have been associated with paraneoplastic encephalitis. Cortical symptoms are often not confined to the limbic system; distinctive symptoms including cerebellar ataxia, chorea, cranial neuropathies, loss of olfaction and taste, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> optic neuropathy have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/32-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-36</a>].

For the classical paraneoplastic encephalitis syndromes, the neuronal damage is T cell mediated, occurs rapidly, and is largely irreversible. Thus, these patients often have limited to no neurologic recovery even with maximal treatment. The best chance for symptom stabilization or improvement appears to be early identification and treatment of the tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/161-163\" class=\"abstract_t\">161-163</a>] and the use of immunotherapy (glucocorticoids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> [IVIG], plasma exchange <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>) in various combinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/161\" class=\"abstract_t\">161</a>]. Exceptions include Ma2 encephalitis, in which about one-third of patients will improve with immunotherapy and tumor treatment, and some cases of paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis. </p><p>In contrast with paraneoplastic encephalitis, the autoimmune encephalitis syndromes are often treatment responsive, as the associated antibodies are likely pathogenic and reversibly affect the target antigens. Thus, treatments are aimed at antibody depletion and immunosuppression (see <a href=\"#H3370789\" class=\"local\">'Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis'</a> above). Recovery can be slow (eg, up to two years in anti-NMDAR encephalitis). Patient response to treatment should be based on clinical evaluation, as antibody titers often do not correlate with disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. </p><p>Seizures should be treated aggressively with antiseizure drugs during the acute illness (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of epilepsy in adults&quot;</a>). Most patients will not require long term antiseizure drug therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>The overall prognosis in patients with autoimmune encephalitis is highly variable, depending on the underlying tumor and its stage as well as the severity of the neurologic syndrome. Some patients make a complete recovery, while others die or have permanent neurologic sequelae of varying severity. Delay to diagnosis and treatment has been associated with a worse prognosis and increased of relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3372297\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immune-mediated encephalitis includes the classic paraneoplastic encephalitis syndromes and the encephalitis syndromes associated with antibodies against neuronal cell <span class=\"nowrap\">surface/synaptic</span> proteins, often referred to as autoimmune encephalitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paraneoplastic encephalitis can involve the limbic system (limbic encephalitis), brainstem (brainstem encephalitis), spinal cord (myelitis), or the entire neuraxis (encephalomyelitis). In most cases, symptoms have an acute to subacute onset and are accompanied by evidence of inflammation in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). (See <a href=\"#H1577775156\" class=\"local\">'Paraneoplastic encephalitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Examples of classic antibody-mediated paraneoplastic encephalitis syndromes include anti-Hu encephalomyelitis, often associated with small cell lung cancer, Ma2-associated encephalitis related to testicular cancer, and anti-CRMP5 encephalomyelitis related to small cell lung cancer (SCLC) or thymoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F77919\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77919 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3372409\" class=\"local\">'Specific antibody-associated syndromes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The autoimmune encephalitis syndromes have a wide clinical spectrum that ranges from typical limbic encephalitis to syndromes with complex neuropsychiatric symptoms such as deficits of memory, cognition, psychosis, seizures, abnormal movements, or coma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F111054\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111054 \">table 2</a>). These disorders are associated with antibodies to neuronal cell <span class=\"nowrap\">surface/synaptic</span> proteins and may occur in the presence or absence of cancer. (See <a href=\"#H100460916\" class=\"local\">'Autoimmune encephalitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis is a well-characterized syndrome characterized by prominent psychiatric manifestations and cognitive dysfunction, speech dysfunction, seizures, dyskinesias and other movement abnormalities, decreased level of consciousness, and autonomic instability (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F111082\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111082 \">table 3</a>). The disorder affects primarily children and adults up to age 45 years; females may have an associated ovarian teratoma. (See <a href=\"#H3370789\" class=\"local\">'Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with suspected paraneoplastic or autoimmune encephalitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F111084\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111084 \">table 5</a>) should have neuroimaging, electroencephalogram (EEG), lumbar puncture, and antibody testing on serum and CSF. Although antibody studies can confirm the diagnosis, initiation of treatment should not be delayed while waiting for antibody results. A provisional diagnosis should be based on the medical history and clinical features; laboratory and radiologic evidence of central nervous system inflammation; and exclusion of infection and other alternative etiologies. (See <a href=\"#H3372498\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of autoimmune or paraneoplastic encephalitis includes a variety of alternative causes of encephalitis and encephalopathy. Broad categories include infection, toxic and metabolic disturbances, vascular disorders, neoplastic disorders, demyelinating and inflammatory disorders, psychiatric disease, neurodegenerative dementias, and rare heritable or metabolic disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F111083\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111083 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5280997\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For paraneoplastic neurologic disorders in general, there is evidence that prompt identification and treatment of the tumor and early initiation of immunotherapy while the neurologic syndrome is still progressing offers the best opportunity to stabilize or slow the progression of the neurologic symptoms. For the autoimmune encephalitis syndromes, early treatment (including that of the tumor if present) improves outcome, speeds recovery and reduces the risk of relapses.
