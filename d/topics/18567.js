The frequency of pain episodes is likely to be underestimated because these episodes are managed at home, especially as individuals with SCD grow older and learn how to manage pain on their own.</p><p>No evidence-based guidelines exist for the treatment of SCD-associated acute pain episodes, either in the hospital or at home. However, reasonable strategies can be employed that are based on established principles of pain management and pharmacokinetics of opioids. Our approach to the management of painful episodes in children and adults with SCD is discussed here.</p><p>Separate topic reviews discuss the evaluation for other SCD complications that present with pain, the mechanisms of vaso-occlusive pain, and other aspects of the management of sickle cell disease:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute evaluation for SCD complications that present with pain</strong> &ndash; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-acute-pain-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of acute pain in sickle cell disease&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pain mechanisms</strong> &ndash; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-vaso-occlusion-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of vaso-occlusion in sickle cell disease&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Overview of clinical manifestations</strong> &ndash; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Overview of management</strong> &ndash; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management and prognosis of sickle cell disease&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Overview of management, pediatric perspective</strong> &ndash; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=routine-comprehensive-care-for-children-with-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Routine comprehensive care for children with sickle cell disease&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute chest syndrome (children)</strong> &ndash; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-acute-chest-syndrome-in-children-and-adolescents-with-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The acute chest syndrome in children and adolescents with sickle cell disease&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute chest syndrome (adults)</strong> &ndash; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-chest-syndrome-in-adults-with-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute chest syndrome in adults with sickle cell disease&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Priapism</strong> &ndash; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=priapism-and-erectile-dysfunction-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Priapism and erectile dysfunction in sickle cell disease&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bone and joint complications</strong> &ndash; (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-and-joint-complications-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bone and joint complications in sickle cell disease&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2710730\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2999214453\"><span class=\"h2\">Appropriate terminology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We use the term sickle cell disease (SCD) to refer to any condition in which an individual carries the sickle hemoglobin mutation at one beta globin allele, along with another beta globin mutation on the other allele. The other beta globin mutation could be the sickle mutation (ie, HbSS) or a different mutation such as one associated with beta thalassemia or hemoglobin C disease.</p><p>We refer to acute pain in individuals with SCD as &quot;painful episodes&quot; or &quot;acute pain episodes&quot; rather than pain &quot;crises.&quot; This terminology reflects the nature of the pain, which may begin as severe pain rather than a crisis event and which should be treated at the outset rather than waiting for a crisis to develop.</p><p>Pain episodes may be challenging to define because pain may occur in many sites, and the degree and duration of pain occurs in a continuum. The Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease (CSSCD) defined a pain episode as pain related to SCD in the extremities, back, abdomen, chest, or head lasting at least two hours and leading to a clinic visit or hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, this underestimates the true degree of pain because many individuals have pain that is treated at home and hence does not lead to a clinic or emergency department visit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3641208447\"><span class=\"h2\">Terminology we avoid</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sickler</strong> &ndash; The term &quot;sickler&quot; should be avoided. This term has a pejorative connotation and is linked to negative attitudes toward individuals with SCD, which in turn may be associated with reduced treatment of pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> distrust of self-reporting of pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The vast majority of individuals with SCD have true, severe, often incapacitating lifelong pain, use pain medication appropriately, and do not have drug-seeking behavior or a substance abuse disorder.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pain crises</strong> &ndash; To reinforce the principle that pain can be actively self-managed in individuals with SCD, we avoid the term &quot;pain crisis,&quot; which has a connotation that individuals with SCD do not have the ability to manage their acute pain. &quot;Pain catastrophizing&quot; has been used to describe a pain experience that is more exaggerated. In a 2018 study, individuals with SCD who had higher pain catastrophizing scores used higher doses of short-acting opioids for pain management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Individuals who have increased negative thinking about pain and are not active in the medical management of their pain have also been found to have higher levels of pain and greater health care use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. As noted above, the term &quot;pain episode&quot; is more descriptive without the negative connotations. (See <a href=\"#H2999214453\" class=\"local\">'Appropriate terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The epidemiology of pain events in SCD depends on the definition used for a pain episode and various other factors including the individual's age, disease severity, and SCD genotype.</p><p>In a prospective study of 3578 individuals with SCD (newborns through adulthood), the annual incidence of pain episodes (defined as pain lasting at least two hours that prompted medical attention) were approximately one per year (0.8, 1.0, and 0.4 for HbSS, <span class=\"nowrap\">HbS/beta(0)</span> thalassemia, and HbSC, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Approximately 5 percent of individuals with HbSS had more than three episodes per year.</p><p>As noted above, however, many adults with SCD who have pain episodes do not seek medical attention. This was demonstrated in a prospective series of 232 adults with SCD who completed a daily pain diary for up to six months (the Pain in Sickle Cell Epidemiology Study [PiSCES]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain was reported on approximately half of the 31,017 days analyzed</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Daily pain was reported by 29 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe vaso-occlusive pain that prompted medical attention was reported on 3.5 percent of days</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain was managed exclusively at home (without medical attention) on 38 percent of days, approximately 80 percent of which included opioids</p><p/><p>The authors concluded that pain was the rule rather than the exception in SCD, despite relatively infrequent emergency department or office visits for pain control.</p><p>Despite the infrequent use of emergency department or hospital visits for pain control, pain episodes represent the most common reason for seeking medical attention in SCD. This was demonstrated in a study of almost 200,000 emergency department visits by children and adults with SCD, in which 67 percent were for pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In comparison, visits for chest symptoms (pain, shortness of breath, cough) and fever accounted for only 20 percent and 6 percent of visits, respectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS AND TRIGGERS FOR PAIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute SCD pain is caused by vaso-occlusion and resulting tissue ischemia and inflammation. The physiologic mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Sickling with obstruction in the microvasculature is accompanied by a number of other changes, including white blood cell activation, alterations in vascular tone, and other environmental and psychosocial factors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-vaso-occlusion-in-sickle-cell-disease#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of vaso-occlusion in sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Multiple pathway model'</a>.)</p><p>Factors that may worsen the severity of SCD pain include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insufficient use of opioid analgesia due to side effects or concerns about opioid dependence</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alterations in opioid metabolism</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychologic components</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuropathic pain</p><p/><p>Hypoventilation, insomnia, or decreased fluid intake, all of which may be exacerbated by pain, might also contribute.</p><p>In the long term, acute pain may be superimposed on chronic pain compounded by SCD complications such as compression fractures, avascular necrosis, arthropathies, or leg ulcers, as well as other coexisting conditions not related to SCD (eg, trauma, arthritis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-vaso-occlusion-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of vaso-occlusion in sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most individuals with SCD become aware of triggers for vaso-occlusive pain and develop strategies to avoid or minimize these triggers. Typical precipitating factors include cold temperature, dehydration, overexertion, and hormonal changes such as onset of menses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/10-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-16</a>]. Exposure to tobacco smoke, wind, air pollution, and asthma exacerbation have also been implicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/17-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-21</a>].</p><p>In a cohort of 3578 individuals with SCD followed prospectively, risk factors for pain included older age (rates were nearly double in adults compared with children of the same genotype), lower fetal hemoglobin concentration, and higher total hemoglobin level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2272263902\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL ASSESSMENT OF PAIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain in SCD is intense; it can begin as early as six months of age and typically lasts throughout life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].

This is essential for determining the type and severity of pain, the effectiveness of treatment, the need for intensified therapy, and the possibility of comorbidities that may also require treatment. (See <a href=\"#H730795\" class=\"local\">'Acute pain management'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-acute-pain-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of acute pain in sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p><strong>The gold standard for assessment of pain is the individual's (or family's) report;</strong> <strong>no combination of clinical and laboratory findings exists to determine (or confirm) whether an individual with SCD is in pain </strong>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Specifically, the absence of hemolysis or stability of the hemoglobin level should <strong>not</strong> be used to justify withholding of pain medication (or administration of a lower dose).</p><p>Acute pain should be assessed rapidly so as not to delay analgesia. At the same time, the pain should be characterized according to location, severity, duration, and potential exacerbating factors. The perspective of the individual in pain (or <span class=\"nowrap\">parent/family</span> member) should be sought regarding whether the pain is typical or atypical of usual pain episodes. The locations of pain vary between individuals and at different times for the same individual. Multiple sites are usually involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Location</strong> &ndash; The main locations for acute vaso-occlusive pain include long bones, abdomen, and chest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Infants and toddlers may present with dactylitis (pain and swelling from infarctions involving the hands and feet).

Toddlers and young children may exhibit irritability or pain on palpation but may be unable to provide a verbal description. For older children and adults, the severity of pain may be assessed using a tool such as a the Wong-Baker FACES scale (for young children) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51021\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51021 \">figure 1</a>) or a visual analog scale (for adolescents and adults) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62346\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62346 \">figure 2</a>); other scales such as the African American Outcher Scale or a simplified five point scale have also been used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/23,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,28,29</a>]. While these tools are helpful and important, their use should not substantially delay prompt administration of adequate analgesia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Neuropathic pain, which may include components of central sensitization, peripheral nerve injury, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hyperalgesia, increases with age and is likely underdiagnosed in individuals with SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. These individuals have hypersensitivity to tactile touch with increased pain from normal stimulus (allodynia), often with extreme sensitivity temperature. They may benefit from chronic therapies directed at neuropathic pain. (See <a href=\"#H3221926409\" class=\"local\">'Chronic pain'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Duration</strong> &ndash; SCD pain may last for hours to days; some people with SCD never become completely pain-free.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">One study described four phases of a painful episode (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F73221\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73221 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. These include a prodromal phase consisting of numbness, aches, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> paresthesias lasting up to 24 hours before the development of acute pain; an <span class=\"nowrap\">initial/infarctive</span> phase of acute pain lasting two to three days; a post-infarctive inflammatory phase; and a <span class=\"nowrap\">resolving/recovery</span> phase.</p><p/><p>Several experts have developed chronic SCD pain descriptors with three modifiers reflecting different clinical features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Examples include not believing the patient's self-report of pain or assuming the patient is drug-seeking because they know which pain medications work best for them.</p><p>Stigmatizing or biased language used in the medical record may also adversely affect the assessment (and hence the treatment) of pain. In a 2018 trial, 413 physicians in training (medical students or residents in internal medicine or emergency medicine) were randomly presented with one of two hypothetical medical record notes that differed only in the terminology used to describe pain, and they were then asked to choose from four options for pain control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Examples of the language used in the notes included the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neutral language</strong> &ndash; Physician note: &quot;He has about 8-10 pain crises per year, for which he typically requires opioid pain medication in the ED&hellip;On physical exam, he is in obvious distress.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Nurse note: &quot;He is not tolerating the oxygen mask and still has <span class=\"nowrap\">10/10</span> pain&hellip;His girlfriend is by his side but will need to go home soon.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Biased language</strong> &ndash; Physician note: &quot;He is narcotic dependent and in our ED frequently.

More negative attitudes also correlated with more years of training.</p><p>The scope of these misconceptions among practicing clinicians is illustrated in the following examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 2005 survey study, 86 percent of physicians in academic teaching hospitals did not believe that self-report is the most reliable indicator of pain among individuals with SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 1997 survey of emergency department physicians and hematologists, 50 percent and 23 percent, respectively, believed that individuals with SCD were addicted to opioids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 2001 survey of 77 nurses who treat individuals with SCD, the majority (63 percent) believed that addiction develops frequently; this belief was especially prevalent in nurses with less clinical experience and less education [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Thirty percent of respondents were reluctant to provide high-dose opioids, many believing they were not indicated for SCD pain. Additional barriers to adequate pain management identified by the survey included insufficient time to provide psychologic support, a narrow range of available analgesics, physicians' reluctance to prescribe opioids, and a belief that individuals with SCD are drug addicts.</p><p/><p>These misconceptions about the frequency of opioid abuse in individuals with SCD must be addressed on the clinical service in order to be able to deliver optimal care for pain episodes.

Pain treatment plans must be tailored to the individual and may vary considerably depending on the daily symptoms, presence of chronic pain, opioid tolerance, medication side effects, and comorbidities such as renal insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/24,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,39</a>].</p><p>Access to short-acting and long-acting opioids at home should be part of a comprehensive SCD pain plan. A clear pain plan with the family should include use of short-acting opioids, long-acting opioids, hydration, adjuvant therapies, interventions to address opioid side effects, and instructions for when to seek medical attention. A comprehensive SCD home-care plan including access to analgesics has been demonstrated to lower emergency department visits for uncomplicated pain by as much as 84 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For individuals with SCD who are not receiving chronic opioid therapy, the principles of managing pain at home are tailored to the pain level and the therapies available. As an example, controlled-release (CR) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> products such as MS-Contin can take three to four hours until peak onset, whereas the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxycodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxycodone</a> product OxyContin will take only approximately half an hour to peak onset. Thus, if long-acting morphine is required for severe pain, it can be accompanied by immediate-release morphine to use until the long-acting product becomes effective and for breakthrough pain.

In the Pain in Sickle Cell Epidemiology Study (PiSCES), at least 10 percent of the adults with SCD used nonopioid analgesics for pain control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Opioid therapy includes <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-and-codeine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen-codeine</a> combinations, controlled-release (CR) agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxycodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxycodone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> along with short-acting agents for breakthrough pain. Opioid with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> combinations can be used but should be limited to a fixed duration of time (eg, 48 to 72 hours) to avoid acetaminophen toxicity, masking of fever from a concurrent infection, or both. For more severe pain, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocodone</a> can be used, followed by immediate-release morphine, followed by a long-acting agent such as CR-morphine or CR-oxycodone. Advantages of CR-oxycodone include a shorter time to onset of pain relief (commonly &lt;40 minutes) and a longer duration of action (approximately 12 hours). Comparable values for CR-morphine are approximately two hours to onset and 8 to 12 hours duration. Treatment with CR pain opioids can be continued for the duration of the pain event and then discontinued. Of note, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=codeine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">codeine</a> will not provide adequate pain relief for many individuals who have a cytochrome P450 gene polymorphism that decreases metabolism to the active opioid. In a study of 73 children with SCD for whom codeine was ineffective, 42 (58 percent) had reduced-function alleles in CYP2D6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Thus, codeine should only be used for individuals known to have previous effective pain control with this agent.</p><p>The true benefit of NSAIDs in SCD is uncertain and unproven. Small observational studies have shown inconsistent results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/44-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-48</a>]. The risks of gastrointestinal bleeding, renal disease, and other complications are all reasons to avoid the routine use of NSAIDs in SCD. Blood flow to the kidneys in individuals with SCD is highly dependent on increased prostaglandin production, and NSAIDs compromise this blood flow and increase the risk for NSAID-induced acute renal failure (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal manifestations of sickle cell disease&quot;</a>). Thus, the use of NSAIDs should be limited to those who are expected to benefit based on prior experience. NSAID use should be limited to four days and to those with mild pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. NSAIDs should be avoided in individuals with renal insufficiency or those at risk of acute renal failure due to deleterious effects on renal blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>].

Thus, pain is likely to have been escalating, and prompt, adequate treatment is needed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F105594\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105594 \">figure 4</a>). Management of pain in individuals with SCD is based on the following cardinal principles as outlined by the American Pain Society (APS) and an evidence-based guideline from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/23,24,42,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24,42,52</a>]. They include the following components:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prompt administration of pain medication (within 30 minutes)</strong> &ndash; Acute pain should be treated in the ED or day hospital as an Emergency Severity Index (ESI) of 2. Triage wait time should be within 15 minutes, and analgesia should be provided as soon as possible, in less than 30 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/24,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,53</a>]. Opioids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydromorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydromorphone</a>) are used. The intravenous route is preferred; subcutaneous administration can be used for those with difficult intravenous access.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For individuals who have previously been treated for a pain episode, the starting dose of opioid is chosen based on the intensity of current pain compared with previous pain and effective doses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For those for whom the previous opioid dose is unknown, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> (0.1 to 0.15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg;</span> maximum initial dose 10 mg) or intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydromorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydromorphone</a> (0.02 to 0.05 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg;</span> maximum initial dose 1.5 mg), with reassessment of pain within 15 to 30 minutes after the dose is administered, is typically appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/23,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,54</a>]. In situations where the previous starting dose was greater than the upper limit of the typical standard dose (eg, &gt;10 mg for morphine or &gt;1.5 mg for hydromorphone), caution should be exercised.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In those with significant renal or hepatic dysfunction, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> (given intravenously) is the opioid of choice.

(See <a href=\"#H2869220\" class=\"local\">'Sedation and respiratory suppression'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rapid reassessment</strong> &ndash; Reassessment is made shortly after the opioid administration is expected to take effect (eg, 20 minutes after administration for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a>, 5 to 10 minutes after <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydromorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydromorphone</a>). Rapid reassessment is critical because many individuals will not have relief of pain from initial dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Individuals with severe pain may require repeated doses of intravenous morphine 0.02 to 0.05 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> every 20 to 30 minutes to achieve pain relief.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If pain relief is adequate with a single dose of opioids, it may be appropriate to discharge the individual home with a long-acting opioid such as CR-oxycodone with a prescription for medication for breakthrough pain.

(See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Continuous opioids/patient controlled analgesia (PCA)'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Avoid ineffective therapies</strong> &ndash; Placebo therapy should <strong>never</strong> be used as it undermines the <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/physician</span> relationship and lengthens the duration of pain. NSAIDs generally are not appropriate for individuals with pain requiring hospitalization, although the appropriateness of their use should be assessed on a case-by-case basis; we do <strong>not</strong> use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketorolac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketorolac</a> in individuals hospitalized with an acute painful episode. (See <a href=\"#H2870181\" class=\"local\">'Therapies we do not use'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The benefit of early and aggressive treatment of pain (eg, treating SCD pain similarly to cancer pain) was demonstrated in a study that compared ED visits and hospitalization before and after institution of this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Each cohort included approximately 50 individuals. The intervention involved rapid intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> with CR-opioids added as needed. ED staff, hospital staff, and study participants were instructed regarding the change in procedure. ED visits decreased substantially following institution of the strategy. In a subset of 15 individuals with the greatest frequency of acute pain episodes who were analyzed before and after the intervention, hospital admissions with the intervention declined dramatically (77 versus 35 over a six-month period) and length of hospital stay was shorter (173 versus 462 days in the hospital), without any compensatory changes in the utilization of other services.</p><p>Routine use of oxygen therapy during an acute vaso-occlusive pain episode is not indicated unless there is evidence of clinically significant decrease in hemoglobin oxygen saturation (typically, of more than four percentage points) when compared with the individual's baseline. Thus, knowledge of baseline hemoglobin oxygen saturation before starting oxygen supplementation is strongly preferred. The rationale for this approach is that when oxygen supplementation is provided unnecessarily and a decline in respiratory status subsequently occurs, the corresponding decline in hemoglobin oxygen saturation may be temporally masked because of the oxygen supplementation. However, individuals with SCD who are in pain often develop acute pulmonary events or hypoxic episodes. Therefore, ongoing or intermittent assessment of pulse oximetry should be part of the routine vital signs for these individuals, along with close monitoring for clinical changes including tachypnea, wheezing, intercostal muscle retraction, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nasal flaring. If these findings develop, immediate reassessment of oxygen saturation and pulmonary status is required. (See <a href=\"#H1137684270\" class=\"local\">'Possible contributing comorbidities'</a> above.)</p><p>Another alternative to initial pain management in the ED is admission to a day hospital, which can provide rapid evaluation and treatment of uncomplicated pain using a pain plan tailored to the individual's analgesic history. SCD day hospitals are staffed by clinicians familiar with SCD care. Studies have shown that day hospitals are effective in decreasing ED visits and hospital admissions. In one study that compared pain management in a day hospital (2259 visits) with the local ED (2401 visits), those treated in the day hospital had a shorter visit for initial pain control (4.5 versus 13 hours), lower hospital admission rate (8 versus 51 percent), and similar rate of re-visit (9.5 percent for each) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Another study reported a reduction in hospitalization rate from 207 to 104 annually during five years of day hospital implementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>As noted below, there is no role for routine blood transfusion in the setting of an isolated vaso-occlusive pain episode.

As noted above, it is important to evaluate and treat any other concomitant conditions that could be contributing to pain. (See <a href=\"#H736519315\" class=\"local\">'Pain characteristics'</a> above.)</p><p>Once a decision to initiate opioid therapy in the hospital is made, the agent, dosing, and schedule of administration must be determined. Use of a clinical pathway with individualized dosing tailored to the individual's needs may improve the quality of care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/59-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-62</a>]. The success of these pathways is strongly dependent upon continuous education of the individual, nurses, and treating clinicians.</p><p>Importantly, as-needed (PRN) pain medication as the sole source of pain relief should be avoided based on the pharmacologic principle that the individual will have subtherapeutic pain medication levels resulting in unnecessary pain.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Agent</strong> &ndash; Appropriate opioid agents include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydromorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydromorphone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F108954\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108954 \">table 6</a>). Morphine is used most commonly in our practice; fentanyl is preferred for individuals with renal or hepatic insufficiency. (See <a href=\"#H532853846\" class=\"local\">'Renal or hepatic dysfunction'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Schedule</strong> &ndash; Medication can be provided by intermittent dosing or continuous infusion. Of these, we prefer continuous infusion by patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) because it provides the most even therapy in the therapeutic window of pain control without side effects, along with the option for self-administration of additional doses for breakthrough pain. However, PCA administration requires rigorous monitoring and appropriate expertise to determine the correct settings and avoid complications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dose</strong> &ndash; The total daily dose is determined from the dosing required in the ED and records of previous dosing requirements. Individuals with renal insufficiency receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> may require dose reductions. Dosing history from prior hospitalizations can be very helpful when determining initial dosing, but this does not substitute for a case-by-case analysis for each individual and each admission.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When using PCA, we use the strategy of the American Pain Society expert panel on the treatment of pain, where the majority of the opioid dose is given through the continuous intravenous route and demand dosing is provided every 20 minutes at a dose equivalent to one-sixth of the hourly infusion dose. The demand dose is used for breakthrough pain and is not intended to substitute for a continuous infusion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Dose adjustments to the PCA typically are made when additional demand medication is required more than three times an hour for two or more consecutive hours. The continuous and breakthrough doses may both be increased. The new continuous hourly dose is started at the level of the previous total hourly amount of medication used (continuous plus demand doses), provided that side effects are not limiting. The new demand dose should remain at one-sixth of the new continuous dose, allowing for all of the clinical personnel to double- and triple-check the amount of opioid provided. This strategy requires all personnel to work as a team to ensure that the individual remains comfortable and not overly sedated. As the PCA is weaned, long-acting oral opioids may be required in some cases and may be continued following discharge from the hospital.

Intervals longer than two to three hours should be avoided because they may lead to increased pain before the next scheduled dose. As-needed schedules that require pain medication to be requested may result in substantial delays <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sleep deprivation by requiring the individual in pain to remain awake most of the night asking for (and waiting for) pain medication.</p><p/><p>As noted below, additional supplemental doses of opioids should be available to all individuals to treat breakthrough pain regardless of the agent, dose, and schedule. (See <a href=\"#H323901\" class=\"local\">'Breakthrough pain'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition, all individuals should be assessed with objective pain tools and sedation scales to ensure that analgesia is adequate and oversedation does not occur. Hemoglobin oxygen saturation monitoring is also helpful in managing severe painful episodes. Orders should include temporary cessation of analgesia and physician notification if the hemoglobin oxygen desaturation level decreases by more than 4 percentage points from the individual's baseline, or if bradypnea occurs.

Breakthrough pain is defined as transitory pain that occurs intermittently while the individual is receiving opioid therapy, that may last only a few minutes to an hour, and that is difficult to distinguish from the persistent pain. The hallmark of breakthrough pain is the swift increase in pain while the individual is being treated with continuous or around-the-clock opioid therapy.</p><p>All individuals hospitalized with pain episodes should have written orders for breakthrough pain medication in order to maintain a therapeutic effect when the breakthrough pain occurs. The best approach is to provide immediate access to pain medication without requiring the individual to call the nurse and wait for additional medication. This is most easily achieved using PCA with a demand dose option. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Continuous opioids/patient controlled analgesia (PCA)'</a> above.)</p><p>Two of the more common mistakes in treating breakthrough pain are overtreating the episode by increasing the <span class=\"nowrap\">around-the-clock/continuous</span> hourly dose, which is likely to result in overtreatment of pain and excessive side effects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F67008\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67008 \">figure 5</a>), or allowing a delay in the treatment of the breakthrough pain, such that medication is administered after the pain has escalated further or subsided. Management of breakthrough pain with as-needed (PRN) pain orders is often inadequate because some nursing protocols may allow up to one hour to administer an as-needed medication.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H971404550\"><span class=\"h3\">Hydroxyurea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For individuals receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> prior to hospitalization, hydroxyurea should be continued at the individual's regular dose during acute events, including hospitalizations, unless there is a hydroxyurea-induced cytopenia or laboratory change [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. A decrease in hemoglobin level with a high reticulocyte count during an acute event is rarely caused by hydroxyurea.</p><p>For individuals not receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> at the time of hospitalization, the possibility of starting hydroxyurea to reduce future pain episodes is generally discussed with the primary hematologist on an outpatient basis when the individual is feeling well; the benefits of hydroxyurea for preventing pain typically do not occur until at least three months after starting therapy. (See <a href=\"#H3810572289\" class=\"local\">'Prevention/reduction of pain episodes'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H323772\"><span class=\"h3\">Hydration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During painful episodes, individuals with SCD are frequently hypovolemic. Reduced oral intake, increased insensible losses, and reduced urinary concentrating ability of the kidney (hyposthenuria) may contribute to a negative fluid balance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal manifestations of sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Diminished concentrating ability'</a>). Individuals with SCD should pay close attention to adequate hydration, and fluid intake, urinary output, and daily weights should be monitored closely during hospitalization.</p><p>For treatment of hypovolemia, we generally give an initial intravenous bolus of 0.5 to 1 liter of normal saline. Many adults with SCD have underlying renal and cardiac dysfunction, and close monitoring of vital signs is essential due to the increased risks of heart failure and pulmonary edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/67-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">67-69</a>]. In addition, renal disease, including renal tubular dysfunction, increases the risk of metabolic acidosis and electrolyte abnormalities including hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, hyperchloremia, and hyperphosphatemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/70-72\" class=\"abstract_t\">70-72</a>]. Thereafter, we use a maintenance rate of combined intravenous and oral fluid that contains at least one-quarter normal saline (roughly 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/m<sup>2</sup></span> per day), targeted to a net even or slightly positive daily fluid balance and a roughly stable body weight. Hospitalized individuals should be encouraged to drink fluids; it is important to place the fluids within reach because individuals in severe pain will be largely confined to the bed.</p><p>High-quality evidence to support a specific route, type, or quantity of hydration is lacking, as discussed in a 2012 Cochrane review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H901451\"><span class=\"h3\">VTE prophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All adults with SCD admitted to the hospital with an acute medical illness should receive venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis. In contrast, we do not use VTE prophylaxis in children with SCD (ie, those younger than 21 years). This is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-sickle-cell-disease#H758245\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management and prognosis of sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Thromboembolism prophylaxis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Weaning of opioids and discharge</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence-based strategies to wean opioids have not been developed for SCD; however, adherence to a few common-sense principles can provide the basis for a successful transition from the hospital to ambulatory setting with adequate pain control. These guidelines include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No weaning of opioids in the first 24 hours unless there are side effects associated with excess opioid effect (eg, respiratory depression, increased lethargy)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wean opioids during the day when appropriate assessment of pain can be performed</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wean opioids incrementally, approximately 10 to 20 percent of the opioid dose at a time</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Opioids should be weaned by decreasing the dose, rather than by increasing the interval between doses</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conversion to oral pain medication should occur when the intravenous dose is roughly equivalent to home doses of oral medications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F108947\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108947 \">table 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F108954\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108954 \">table 6</a>)</p><p/><p>Typically, individuals can be discharged from the hospital when pain is adequately controlled on oral analgesics. If the individual does not usually require long-acting opioids at home, we recommend discontinuing the long-acting opioids when the pain event subsides. However, if the individual requires long-acting opioids at home, these should be made available.</p><p>Evidence regarding the relative effectiveness and risks of long-acting opioid therapy versus short-acting therapy is limited. Many individuals with SCD are managed with combination opioid therapy. When weaning to an oral regimen, the provider should match the opioid dose and schedule that will be given at home during the last 12 to 24 hours of hospitalization. This strategy also ensures that the home regimen will be effective in relieving pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. To be most effective, combination therapy should be managed by one provider. A mutually agreed-upon protocol enables earlier hospital discharge and optimal monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p>We strongly advise that all individuals with SCD receive their prescription from the outpatient hospital pharmacy to ensure that they have the appropriate medication prior to leaving the hospital. Nationally, pharmacies are being given more discretion about if and when they will fill an opioid prescription. On more than one occasion, individuals have been sent home on the weekends or at other times of the week and unable to fill their prescription at the neighborhood pharmacy, which has the potential to lead to recurrence of pain and rehospitalization. Discharge without opioid prescriptions (eg, with NSAIDs alone) has been shown in retrospective studies to be associated with a higher 30-day readmission rate than discharge with adequate home medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,77</a>].</p><p>In addition to having prescriptions filled for pain medicines and, when appropriate, instructions for additional weaning, all individuals need a follow-up visit in the outpatient clinic within two weeks of discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].</p><p>Strategies to reduce the frequency and severity of painful episodes, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> therapy and an individualized care plan tailored to the needs of the individual, are discussed with the primary hematologist on an outpatient basis when the individual is feeling well; the benefits of hydroxyurea for preventing pain typically do not occur until at least three months after starting therapy. (See <a href=\"#H3810572289\" class=\"local\">'Prevention/reduction of pain episodes'</a> below.)</p><p>The importance of having a detailed plan for pain control and appropriate outpatient follow-up at the time of discharge is illustrated by reviews of rehospitalization rates for individuals with SCD admitted for acute pain episodes. A review of rehospitalization rates for 408 children with SCD admitted with acute pain episodes found that having an outpatient visit was associated with lower rates of readmission to the hospital at two weeks and one month (hazard ratios [HR] 0.23, 95% CI 0.12-0.41 and 0.44, 95% CI 0.33-0.59, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. Similarly, in a single-center pediatric case control study, the greatest risk factor for readmission was no outpatient hematology follow-up within 30 days of discharge (odds ratio [OR] 7.7, 95% CI 2.4-24.4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. The risk factors for readmission appear to be similar in adults. This was illustrated in a single-center study in which approximately half of the adults with SCD admitted for acute painful episodes were readmitted within one month after discharge and approximately 16 percent were readmitted within one week after discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H730666\"><span class=\"h2\">Adjuvant therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adjuvant therapies are an important component of the management of acute and chronic pain.

These interventions should be tailored to the needs of the individual and family and may change over time.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Psychosocial support</strong> &ndash; As with any condition that produces chronic pain, SCD pain may be associated with various psychosocial stresses that contribute to depression and social isolation. This may be especially true during transition from pediatric to adult care. Psychosocial support should be appropriate to the individual's needs and may include cognitive-behavioral approaches, relaxation or breathing exercises, yoga, or self-hypnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/24,53,81-83\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,53,81-83</a>]. For chronic pain, muscle relaxation and self-hypnosis have been suggested in the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) guidance on managing SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Mechanisms of chronic pain differ from acute pain and may include bone and joint complications (eg, avascular necrosis, leg ulcers) and central sensitization and hyperalgesia, among others. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis and triggers for pain'</a> above.)</p><p>Chronic pain in SCD differs from other forms of chronic pain (eg, cancer pain) in that chronic pain in SCD is typically interspersed with episodic and chaotic waxing and waning acute pain. SCD-associated pain is also likely to have a larger component of neuropathic pain, peripheral and central sensitization to pain, and opioid hyperalgesia. Individuals with SCD may have to navigate a greater number of providers unfamiliar with their condition and may face a higher degree of provider misperceptions about the existence of and intensity of pain than individuals with cancer.</p><p>Examples of studies documenting the frequency of chronic pain in SCD include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study that collected pain diary information from 39 children and adolescents with SCD, pain attributable to SCD was reported on 8 percent of days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Multicenter Study of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Hydroxyurea</a> (MSH) collected data from pain diaries for 299 adults with SCD who had at least three painful episodes per year prior to enrollment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>].

On one extreme, pain may occur on a small percentage of days and the individual may prefer to avoid chronic medications. On the other extreme, some individuals have pain on the majority of days and require opioids on a regular basis. The use of an individualized care plan, which can be made available to all treating clinicians, can be extremely helpful in reducing episodes of more severe pain and giving the affected individual (or family) greater autonomy in treating pain at home. Adjuvant therapies and psychosocial support are especially important.

Approval was based on a trial that randomly assigned 230 children and adults with sickle cell anemia or sickle thalassemia, five years and older, who had at least two pain events in the prior year, to receive glutamine (0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> orally twice per day in powder form; maximum daily dose 30 g) or placebo and monitored for approximately one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/93,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">93,94</a>]. Individuals who were pregnant or who had serious liver or renal disease were excluded. Approximately two-thirds of the participants in both arms also had been receiving hydroxyurea on a stable dose for at least three months and continued hydroxyurea during the trial. Compared with placebo, those who received glutamine had fewer acute pain events (4 versus 3), fewer hospitalizations (3 versus 2), fewer days in the hospital (11 versus 7), and fewer episodes of acute chest syndrome (23 versus 9). Similar benefit was observed regardless of hydroxyurea use, suggesting no treatment interaction with hydroxyurea. These results are similar to data in a similar trial from the same group with a smaller number of participants and shorter follow&ndash;up, as well as small observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/95,96\" class=\"abstract_t\">95,96</a>].

However, the long-term efficacy of glutamine is unknown and requires additional study. We would use the formulation evaluated in rigorous clinical trials, as the benefit of other glutamine formulations, including those available over the counter, have not been studied with similar rigor.</p><p>Glutamine is an amino acid that participates in several biochemical reactions. The mechanism by which it reduces pain episodes is thought to involve a favorable effect on nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) biology and oxidative stress in red blood cells (RBCs) that contain sickle hemoglobin. Glutamine is a precursor used to form NAD. In earlier studies, sickle RBCs were shown to exhibit increased glutamine import; increased levels of glutamate, the byproduct of NAD creation; and a decreased ratio of reduced to total NAD (decreased ratio of NADH to NAD) that correlated with decreased redox potential and could be reversed by glutamine administration; all of which supported the hypothesis that increased oxidative stress could be at least partially reversed with glutamine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. RBCs from individuals with SCD who were treated with glutamine showed reduced sickling on the peripheral blood smear and were less sickled and less adherent to vascular cells than RBCs from untreated individuals in an in vitro assay, suggesting that improved redox biology might make sickle RBCs less adhesive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/96,97\" class=\"abstract_t\">96,97</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1318847854\"><span class=\"h2\">Individualized care plan</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Every individual with SCD should have an established care plan for pain management that takes into account their (and their family's) individual needs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F106388\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106388 \">table 1</a>).

Multiple doses of meperidine are associated with accumulation of the metabolite normeperidine, which can cause central nervous system toxicity including but not limited to mild twitching, multifocal clonus, and seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/24,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2870295\"><span class=\"h2\">Ketorolac</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We avoid <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketorolac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketorolac</a> in adults with SCD hospitalized for vaso-occlusive pain because the efficacy of adding a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> for inpatient management of acute vaso-occlusive pain episodes has not been demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Further, ketorolac has a number of toxicities that are especially concerning in individuals with SCD. Prescribing information for ketorolac has boxed warnings regarding appropriate use (limited to five days, not for children, not for chronic pain), gastrointestinal risk, cardiovascular risk, bleeding, and others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. Renal toxicity, including irreversible renal failure, can occur with ketorolac administration in individuals with and without compromised renal function. The observation that kidney injury may occur in individuals without underlying renal disease was illustrated in a retrospective review involving 197 admissions in 97 children and adolescents who presented with SCD-related pain episodes associated with acute kidney injury (AKI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. This analysis found that in those treated with ketorolac, the likelihood of developing AKI increased in a dose-dependent manner for each day of ketorolac therapy.</p><p>Importantly, the estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) calculated from serum creatinine levels in SCD are an overestimate, approximately 29 percent above the actual GFR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>].

The lack of efficacy for NSAIDs in improving pain control was demonstrated in a trial that randomly assigned 54 adults with 66 vaso-occlusive pain episodes to receive the intravenous NSAID <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketoprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketoprofen</a> or placebo; all received intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> in addition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

These and other indications for RBC transfusion are presented in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-sickle-cell-disease#H9587051\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusion in sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Indications for transfusion'</a>.)</p><p>Importantly, vaso-occlusive pain may accompany other SCD complications for which transfusion is indicated. If both pain and another complication requiring RBC transfusion are present, both interventions (pain control and transfusion) should be administered concurrently. Adequate analgesia for pain should not be deferred or delayed while awaiting or administering a transfusion, because transfusion does not treat pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2870359\"><span class=\"h2\">Magnesium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnesium was proposed as a potentially safe method of treating pain due to its potential role in ion flux, which may affect RBC hydration and propensity for sickling.

This trial randomly assigned 208 children with SCD to receive magnesium at a dose of 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> intravenously or placebo every eight hours for up to six doses. There were no differences in the primary outcome (length of hospital stay, 56 versus 47 hours) or secondary outcomes, including opioid use, health-related quality of life, or markers of inflammation, despite the potential role of magnesium as a vasodilator <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anti-inflammatory agent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2870427\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoids are commonly used to treat inflammatory states. However, only one small randomized trial has addressed use in SCD. In this trial, 36 children with SCD admitted to the hospital for 56 episodes of acute vaso-occlusive pain were randomly assigned to receive intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> or placebo; all received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>]. The duration of inpatient analgesic therapy was significantly shorter in the glucocorticoid group (41 versus 71 hours); this effect persisted when children with acute chest syndrome were removed from the analysis. However, a greater number in the glucocorticoid group were readmitted to the hospital within one week of discharge (3 versus 15 percent). The high rates of rebound pain rate and adverse effects of glucocorticoids (gastrointestinal bleeding, avascular necrosis of bone), especially in individuals who are already predisposed to these complications, further reduces enthusiasm for this approach. A preliminary trial in which 54 individuals with SCD were randomly assigned to receive inhaled glucocorticoids or placebo suggested that the inhaled glucocorticoids might be a promising way to treat pain while avoiding systemic toxicities of glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>].

Neither trial showed improved pain control with NO, although there were trends toward benefit. A third trial that randomly assigned 150 individuals age 10 years or older with acute vaso-occlusive pain to receive 72 hours of inhaled NO or placebo found no difference in the time to resolution of the acute painful episode (73 versus 66 hours) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Enhancing endogenous NO</strong> &ndash; Another trial evaluated the possibility that arginine, the obligate substrate for NO production, could reduce acute painful episodes.

Other available therapies and approaches to altering the opioid agent <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> schedule are presented separately.

Typically, low-dose infusional naloxone (0.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/hour)</span> is administered in conjunction with intravenous patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). Low-dose infusional naloxone should only be used by experienced practitioners.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2869220\"><span class=\"h2\">Sedation and respiratory suppression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sedation is a common side effect of opioids. Associated respiratory depression is especially concerning due to the increased risk of acute chest syndrome. It is also especially important in individuals with SCD to distinguish opioid-induced central nervous system changes from cerebrovascular complications of SCD. The clinical differences are usually obvious (eg, timing relative to drug administration, abrupt versus gradual onset).</p><p>Sedation-associated respiratory suppression is especially concerning during hospitalization because individuals with SCD are also at risk of hospital-acquired respiratory infection and acute chest syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-acute-chest-syndrome-in-children-and-adolescents-with-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The acute chest syndrome in children and adolescents with sickle cell disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-chest-syndrome-in-adults-with-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute chest syndrome in adults with sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A reasonable plan for monitoring and risk reduction includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulse oximetry is monitored during administration of intravenous opioids in the hospital.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incentive spirometry should be performed every two hours while awake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/24,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ambulation and activity should be encouraged as soon as possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/24,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other sedating medications should be avoided when possible in individuals receiving intravenous opioids. As examples, for nausea we prefer a selective 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonist (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ondansetron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ondansetron</a>) rather than a phenothiazine and for insomnia we prefer melatonin and good sleep hygiene habits. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-insomnia-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of insomnia in adults&quot;, section on 'Sleep hygiene'</a>.)</p><p/><p>The key to success with incentive spirometry is having hospital personnel engage the individual and provide sufficient instruction; often, this is best achieved using an established nursing protocol. In selected cases, intermittent positive pressure breathing therapy may be appropriate. The benefit of incentive spirometry in preventing respiratory complications during pain episodes was demonstrated in a trial that randomly assigned 29 children and young adults with SCD to receive incentive spirometry (10 maximal inspirations every two hours while awake) versus no incentive spirometry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>]. Pulmonary complications were significantly reduced in those receiving incentive spirometry compared with controls (5 versus 42 percent).</p><p>Importantly, an opioid reversal agent (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naloxone</a>) should <strong>not</strong> be given to an individual who is somnolent but easily arousable as this may precipitate severe pain requiring greater opioid doses to control. Rather, the opioid should be held until the somnolence lessens. Naloxone should be reserved for symptomatic respiratory depression <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> impending respiratory failure. If used, naloxone should be administered in small doses or as a low-dose infusion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-management-of-side-effects-in-patients-receiving-opioids-for-chronic-pain#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and management of side effects in patients receiving opioids for chronic pain&quot;, section on 'Sleep-disordered breathing'</a>.)</p><p>In contrast to somnolence and decreased respiratory rate, respiratory distress with tachypnea and anxiety is not a side effect of opioid therapy. This finding should prompt evaluation for other conditions such as pulmonary embolism or acute chest syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2869387\"><span class=\"h2\">Pruritus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pruritus is a common problem with all opioid analgesics. The mechanism involves histamine release from skin mast cells via opioid receptor signaling. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mast-cells-surface-receptors-and-signal-transduction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mast cells: Surface receptors and signal transduction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The management should be individualized based on symptoms and medication toxicities. Antihistamines are often required.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For individuals with pruritus on chronic opioid therapy, effective approaches include the use of nonsedating antihistamines, substitution of a different agent (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydromorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydromorphone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a>), or adding a 5-hydroxytriptamine (5-HT<sub>3</sub>) receptor antagonist (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ondansetron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ondansetron</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=granisetron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">granisetron</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For hospitalized individuals, continuous infusion of low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naloxone</a> (0.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> per hour) has been very helpful in decreasing pruritus without requiring opioid adjustment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Morphine</a> and naloxone are compatible in the same intravenous line and can be infused simultaneously.</p><p/><p>Importantly, an individual should not be falsely labeled as having an opioid allergy solely on the basis of pruritus, because this may result in avoidance of therapy that is effective in controlling pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=drug-allergy-classification-and-clinical-features#H39\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Drug allergy: Classification and clinical features&quot;, section on 'Pseudoallergic reactions'</a>.)</p><p>Additional information on the management of opioid-induced pruritus and other options for treatment are presented separately.

Large academic centers in the United States and Europe have reported evidence of substance abuse in 0 to 9 percent of individuals with SCD; the incidence in comparable populations without SCD is 6 to 9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/56,124-128\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,124-128</a>]. Thus, the primary focus on treating an acute pain episode in SCD should be relief of pain rather than withholding medication because of the concern about drug dependency.</p><p>The incidence of opioid-use disorder in individuals with SCD is routinely greatly overestimated by clinicians, despite the availability of this evidence. This may be in part because the majority of individuals with SCD manage the majority of their pain episodes at home or through their primary clinician. As a result, hospital staff may only encounter the one or two individuals with SCD who have an opioid-use disorder from among the hundreds or thousands of individuals with SCD in the local population who do not. It is critical that clinicians not extrapolate from these one or two individuals to the rest of the SCD population.</p><p>In addition, it is important for clinicians to understand that the use of opioids under appropriate medical supervision, regardless of amount or frequency, does <strong>not</strong> constitute an opioid-use disorder. Increasing dose requirements due to changes in drug metabolism (ie, tolerance) or withdrawal symptoms upon opioid discontinuation (ie, physical dependence) are normal physiologic reactions and are not indicative of substance addiction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=opioid-use-disorder-epidemiology-pharmacology-clinical-manifestations-course-screening-assessment-and-diagnosis#H134294768\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Opioid use disorder: Epidemiology, pharmacology, clinical manifestations, course, screening, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>When concerns about opioid-use disorder or drug abuse occur, they are best raised and discussed outside of the setting of an acute pain episode. In such situations, a multidisciplinary approach is used, including a complete review of the opioid prescription history, hospital records of opioid usage, and a discussion with the primary care physician and the rest of the clinical team (medical social worker, case worker, psychologist). A care plan for addressing these concerns should be created and implemented with subsequent episodes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H316824\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H532853846\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal or hepatic dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For individuals with renal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hepatic insufficiency, we use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> due to a favorable metabolism profile and possible reduced somnolence and respiratory depression with fentanyl.</p><p>Intranasal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> has been safely used in the initial acute emergency department management of SCD pain, including in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/129\" class=\"abstract_t\">129</a>]. This agent is rapid-acting, has a short duration of action, and avoids delays associated with obtaining intravenous access. A 2014 Cochrane review of the use of intranasal fentanyl found it to be effective for pain control in children &gt;3 years of age without SCD who had moderate to severe pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/130\" class=\"abstract_t\">130</a>].

In the long term, acute pain may be superimposed on chronic pain compounded by SCD complications such as compression fractures, avascular necrosis, arthropathies, or leg ulcers, as well as other coexisting conditions. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis and triggers for pain'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is important to use appropriate terminology when referring to pain in individuals with SCD because the use of stigmatizing or catastrophizing language impacts the effectiveness of pain control. (See <a href=\"#H2710730\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2898465372\" class=\"local\">'Provider misperceptions that interfere with the assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The gold standard for assessment of pain is the individual's report; no combination of clinical and laboratory findings exists to determine (or confirm) whether an individual with SCD is in pain. Acute pain should be assessed rapidly to facilitate appropriate analgesia and determine whether other conditions such as acute chest syndrome are present. Placebo should never be used. (See <a href=\"#H2272263902\" class=\"local\">'Clinical assessment of pain'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain from vaso-occlusion should be distinguished from other sources of somatic and visceral pain such as bone infarction or splenic sequestration because these may require additional treatments along with (but not instead of) analgesia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-acute-pain-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of acute pain in sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Home management is the most frequent setting for acute pain management in SCD. We use a stepwise approach to match therapies with pain severity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F106388\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106388 \">table 1</a>). Individuals not receiving chronic opioids start with nonopioid therapy for mild pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F70067\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70067 \">table 2</a>) followed by opioids of escalating strengths (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F108947\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108947 \">table 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F108954\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108954 \">table 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F108955\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108955 \">table 3</a>). Individuals who require long-acting opioids on a regular basis should have additional short-acting medication for breakthrough pain. There should be a clear plan for when to seek medical services and whom to contact if these do not provide adequate pain relief. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Management at home'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most individuals with SCD-associated pain only present to the hospital or emergency department (ED) when their pain has exceeded what they can manage at home with oral opioids. Acute pain should be treated as an Emergency Severity Index (ESI) of 2 (&lt;30-minute triage wait time) with rapid reassessment after initial opioid dosing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F105594\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105594 \">figure 4</a>). Appropriate analgesic agents include intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> (0.1 to 0.15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg),</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydromorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydromorphone</a> (0.02 to 0.05 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg),</span> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> (for those with renal or hepatic dysfunction). If pain is not relieved with more than two doses, hospitalization for around-the-clock parenteral analgesics is indicated, preferably using a patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) program that allows additional demand dosing. Attention should be paid to breakthrough pain, hydration status, and potential adverse effects of opioids. (See <a href=\"#H730795\" class=\"local\">'Acute pain management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H532853846\" class=\"local\">'Renal or hepatic dysfunction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We do not use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meperidine-pethidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meperidine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketorolac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketorolac</a> due to potential toxicities and lack of additional benefit.
