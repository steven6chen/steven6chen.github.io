This condition is also referred to as intractable, medically refractory, or pharmacoresistant epilepsy. As many as 20 to 40 percent of patients with epilepsy (roughly 400,000 people living in the US) are likely to have refractory epilepsy. The annual cost for patients with epilepsy in the United States is estimated to be approximately 12.5 billion dollars (based on a 1995 survey); DRE contributes a substantive proportion of this cost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. People with DRE have the greatest burden of epilepsy-related disabilities, further contributing to the scope of this problem.</p><p>Because of the need to individualize therapy, no rigid set of guidelines can be applied to determine medical intractability, however, population-based studies have provided information regarding the prognosis of DRE that are helpful in making treatment decisions. Resective surgical therapy for epilepsy has the potential to eliminate seizures in many patients with localization-related DRE.</p><p>This topic discusses the evaluation and approach to the management of individuals with DRE. Other issues regarding the evaluation and treatment of individuals with seizures and epilepsy are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of epilepsy in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-the-first-seizure-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of the first seizure in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of epilepsy in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical treatment of epilepsy in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vagus-nerve-stimulation-therapy-for-the-treatment-of-epilepsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vagus nerve stimulation therapy for the treatment of epilepsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traditionally, therapeutic failure of three antiseizure drugs defined intractability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/3-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-11</a>]. With many new antiseizure drugs available in recent years, it might have been expected that more, rather than fewer, drug trials would be recommended before determining intractability. However, several prospective case series have shown that a high likelihood of medical intractability can be identified after two unsuccessful trials, as with each antiseizure drug failure, the likelihood of successful treatment with other drugs diminishes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/5-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-13</a>]. As an example, in one study, 1098 adolescent and adult patients with a diagnosis of epilepsy were started de novo on antiseizure drug treatment and followed up to 25 years (median of 7.5 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. With the first drug trial, 49 percent became seizure free. A second medication trial produced remission in an additional 13 percent, while only a further 4 percent became seizure-free on a third medication regimen. In this cohort, these patterns of antiseizure drug responsiveness largely persisted over time.</p><p>A task force of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) proposed that drug-resistant be defined as the failure of adequate trials of two tolerated, appropriately chosen and administered antiseizure drugs (whether as monotherapy or in combination) to achieve seizure freedom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. They also recommended replacing the term &quot;intractable&quot; with &quot;drug-resistant&quot; epilepsy (DRE).</p><p>Approximately one third of patients who meet this definition of DRE subsequently achieve prolonged (12 months or more) periods of seizure remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. However, the risk of seizure relapse in these individuals remains high, greater than 70 percent in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Frequency and severity of seizures are less commonly included in a definition of DRE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/4,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,17</a>]. These can vary among individuals with DRE and are important considerations when weighing treatment options. Similarly, it is important to understand the impact of seizures in the context of the individual's life, job, and other psychosocial circumstances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Even infrequent seizures can have a large impact.</p><p>Less often considered, but also important, is the burden of adverse effects of antiseizure drugs that a patient experiences. If seizures can be controlled but only at medication doses that produce disabling side effects, then it may also be reasonable to consider that such a person has DRE.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of unstandardized definitions as well as misdiagnoses, the incidence and prevalence of DRE are somewhat uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Estimates of the proportion of epilepsy cases that are or become medically resistant vary between 20 and 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/3,11,20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,11,20-23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of prospective studies have attempted to identify factors that predict the risk of DRE. These studies have varied somewhat in their sampling (population-based versus hospital-based) and whether they included children, adults, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. No single factor has been found to be uniquely useful in making accurate predictions. A combination of two or more of these factors may help to define those who are not likely to respond to medical treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The response to the first antiseizure drug trial is the most important and consistently cited predictive factor among both population-based and hospital-based studies and in both adult and pediatric populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/5,6,13,24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,13,24-27</a>]. While more than half of patients respond to the first antiseizure drug prescribed, less than 20 percent are likely to respond to subsequent drug trials. Antiseizure drug failure due to lack of efficacy is a stronger predictor of DRE than failure due to intolerance or side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. With each number of failed antiseizure drug trials, the risk of DRE increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/11,26,28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,26,28-30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A high number of seizures prior to diagnosis and treatment is another consistently identified risk factor for DRE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/5-7,11,20,24,25,31-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7,11,20,24,25,31-36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The underlying etiology and seizure classification are also important.

These include early (neonatal) myoclonic encephalopathy, early infantile epileptic encephalopathy, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and Rasmussen encephalitis among others.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Localization-related epilepsy underlies more than half of the cases of DRE in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Among the localization-related epilepsies, those associated with vascular lesions may be more treatment responsive than those with mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS), cortical dysgenesis, or dual pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/6,24,37-39,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,24,37-39,42</a>]. Individuals with MTS have some of the highest rates of medical intractability, 40 to 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/3,6,8,16,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6,8,16,38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other findings more variably associated with the risk of DRE include a presentation with status epilepticus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/7,25,28,37,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,25,28,37,40</a>], a longer duration of epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/29,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,31</a>], a family history of epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/11,20,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,20,33</a>], a history of febrile convulsions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], and abnormal EEG findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/7,11,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11,24</a>]. An abnormal neurologic examination <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> developmental delay are also identified as risk factors for DRE in some studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/20,28,32,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,28,32,37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some studies, but not all, suggest that age at presentation may be a factor in the development of DRE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/6,11,24,28,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11,24,28,36,37</a>]. Some pediatric studies have found that seizure onset in later childhood or adolescence appears to be more likely to be associated with DRE than seizures with onset between the ages of 5 and 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/7,32,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,32,40</a>]. Onset in the neonatal time period has been associated with DRE in at least one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Individuals who develop epilepsy later in life (&gt;65 years) appear to be less likely to develop DRE than younger adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/23,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,43</a>]. The varying risk of DRE by age group likely relates to the underlying pathogenesis of epilepsy that also varies by age.</p><p/><p>The studies cited above have generally been performed in studies examining a patient's response to initial antiseizure drug trials. However, a smaller percentage of patients with epilepsy enter remission early in their course and develop DRE later, after a period of remission that in some cases is as long as several years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/9,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,23</a>]. Factors that predict a later development of DRE are not well defined. However, this phenomenon of delayed intractability is most commonly described in the setting of mesial temporal sclerosis. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is uncertain why seizures are or become medically resistant in any given individual.</p><p>Medical intractability may be a feature of epilepsy at the time of presentation or may evolve over time. Prospective studies with a long duration of follow-up suggest that 70 to 80 percent of patients retain their status as intractable versus in remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/4,9,20,23,25,35,41,44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9,20,23,25,35,41,44-46</a>]. This means that a minority of patients with apparent DRE are subsequently able to achieve remission and also that some patients whose seizures are initially controlled will later relapse. In the latter group, medical control can be regained with subsequent drug trials in some patients, while in others, medical intractability persists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/41,47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,47-49</a>]. These different clinical courses may represent different mechanisms of medical intractability or pharmacoresistance.</p><p>A delayed development of intractability is most often described with epilepsy onset in childhood, particularly with epilepsy associated with mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/9,41,50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,41,50,51</a>]. Accumulating evidence suggests that in some individuals, MTS is a progressive condition. Pathologic studies demonstrate an evolving process involving glial proliferation and dendritic sprouting with synaptic reorganization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/11,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,52</a>]. Longitudinal neuroimaging studies also support a progressive process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/36,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,53</a>]. Alterations in neural circuitry conceivably may lead to an epileptic network that becomes drug resistant over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=localization-related-focal-epilepsy-causes-and-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Localization-related (focal) epilepsy: Causes and clinical features&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Studies in animal models and patients comparing drug-resistant and drug-sensitive temporal lobe epilepsy have found that the former is associated with altered expression of multidrug transporters, altered expression of antiseizure drug targets, as well as morphologic alterations in the hippocampus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/30,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,55</a>].</p><p>Distinguishing which of these findings is the cause versus the effect of intractable epilepsy, and whether they have clinical relevance in humans, are the subjects of ongoing investigations. As an example, one study found an association with a polymorphism in the drug transporter gene (ABCB1 or MDR1) and drug-resistant epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>], although this was not corroborated in follow-up studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/57-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-59</a>]. An alternative hypothesis is that overexpression of these multidrug transporters is induced by recurrent seizures, potentially providing an impetus for early aggressive seizure treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/30,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,60</a>].</p><p>Other alterations, acquired or inherited, of antiseizure drug absorption, metabolism, receptor-binding, and blood brain barrier permeability are also potential causes of pharmacoresistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS OF INTRACTABLE EPILEPSY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals with DRE have an increased mortality rate, estimated at 1.37 per 100 person-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/27,63-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,63-65</a>]. The standardized mortality ratio for patients with recurrent seizures is 4.69 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Provided they survive the underlying cause of their seizures, individuals who become seizure free do not appear to have increased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>Some deaths are related to the underlying cause of epilepsy (eg, cerebral neoplasm, neurodegenerative disease); other deaths are directly seizure-related, such as those that occur in the context of status epilepticus and in seizure-related accidents. Sudden unexplained death in epilepsy patients (SUDEP) is 40 times more likely among patients who continue to have seizures than in those who are seizure free [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].

These include head injury, burns, and fractures, among others; most are seizure-related [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>DRE is also associated with disability and diminished quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/8,11,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11,68</a>]. Examples include poor academic achievement, unemployment, and social isolation. Most patients with DRE cannot drive. In one community-based survey of people with epilepsy, those with self-reported incomplete seizure control were more likely to express concerns about the feelings of fear, their quality of life, work, adverse effects of therapy, and the stigma associated with their condition, even when their seizures were relatively infrequent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. These complications of DRE result from the combined effects of recurrent seizures, antiseizure drug toxicity, comorbid depression, as well as psychosocial factors such as excessive dependency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/8,11,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11,68</a>].

Clinicians should also reconsider the diagnosis of epilepsy. Misdiagnosis is common; in one series, as many as 26 percent of individuals thought to have DRE were incorrectly diagnosed most often as a result of incomplete history-taking <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> EEG misinterpretation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Apparent intractability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to differentiate true versus apparent medical intractability. Reasons for apparent treatment failure that do not reflect intractability include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An incorrect diagnosis of seizure classification leading to incorrect drug choice. It is not uncommon for idiopathic generalized epilepsy syndromes to be unrecognized and inappropriately treated with antiseizure drugs that are more appropriate to localization-related epilepsy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F78021\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78021 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In some instances, a narrow-spectrum antiseizure drug can worsen seizure frequency in individuals with generalized epilepsy. One example is when <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a> is prescribed for juvenile myoclonic epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/70-72\" class=\"abstract_t\">70-72</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inappropriate dose.

In contrast, seizures can also occur with antiseizure drug toxicity.

While not without limitations, video-EEG monitoring is the gold standard test for the diagnosis of PNES.</p><p>Among patients referred to epilepsy monitoring units for apparent IE, 25 to 40 percent are diagnosed with PNES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-drug-resistant-epilepsy/abstract/76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,77</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with localization-related DRE should have a magnetic resonance imaging study (MRI) to identify a potential surgical lesion. The sensitivity of MRI can be enhanced by the use of an epilepsy MRI protocol. Other neuroimaging studies (eg, single photon emission computed tomography [SPECT], positron emission tomography [PET]) can be employed in individuals in whom MRI does not show a lesion, in whom the MRI lesion does not correspond to the EEG localization, or who have dual pathology. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Neuroimaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend surgical evaluation for patients with localization-related or partial epilepsy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). MRI scan performed using an epilepsy protocol will often identify a lesion (eg, mesial temporal sclerosis, cortical dysplasia) amenable to surgical resection. The best efficacy for surgery is achieved in individuals with concordant localization of MRI and EEG abnormalities. For patients without a MRI lesion, an MRI lesion that is discordant with EEG findings, or with dual pathology, further neuroimaging studies can help identify an epileptic focus that might respond to surgical therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical treatment of epilepsy in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients in whom epilepsy surgery is not an option or whose seizures persist after surgery, we suggest treatment trials with other antiseizure drugs appropriate for their epilepsy syndrome <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vagus nerve stimulation or responsive cortical stimulation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). While the chance of seizure remission with these treatments is not high, reductions in seizure frequency and improved quality of life are possible in most.
