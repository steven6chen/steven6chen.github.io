It is the most common of the clinically indolent NHLs defined as those lymphomas in which survival of the untreated patient is measured in years. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-the-hematopoietic-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of the hematopoietic neoplasms&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The initial treatment of FL depends upon the stage of disease at presentation. Patients with early stage disease may be cured with radiation therapy, while patients with advanced stage disease are initially managed with an immunotherapy-based regimen (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> plus chemotherapy). The use of either autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in FL is controversial and the subject of ongoing clinical trials. Autologous HCT may result in prolonged remissions and has a low treatment-related mortality rate. In comparison, allogeneic HCT may cure a higher percentage of patients with advanced stage FL, but is associated with substantial treatment-related mortality. </p><p>The use of autologous HCT in FL is reviewed below. The use of allogeneic HCT in FL and comparison with other treatment options are presented separately.

Outside of a clinical trial, HCT is reserved for patients with relapsed or refractory FL or for those with histologic transformation to a more aggressive histology. Among patients with relapsed FL, a choice between HCT and chemotherapy without HCT is made on an individual basis. HCT is generally preferred for patients with clinically aggressive disease as demonstrated by a short remission duration. This is primarily based upon prospective randomized trials that have demonstrated a survival benefit from HCT in patients with relapsed FL, but failed to demonstrate a survival benefit in patients with previously untreated disease. HCT is also a reasonable treatment option for select patients with FL that has transformed to a more aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtype.</p><p>Interpretation of the trials that have investigated the relative value of HCT versus combination chemotherapy alone for patients with FL is complicated by subsequent changes in the standard care of FL. Importantly, the routine incorporation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> or its radioimmunoconjugates into the standard treatment of FL has improved survival rates among patients who do not undergo HCT. Survival advantages seen in some early trials of HCT may not have been evident had the combination chemotherapy treatment arms involved the addition of these agents. Conversely, a lack of survival advantage seen in other early trials may have been because the patients did not receive sufficient chemotherapy immediately before transplantation, leading to incomplete disease control <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> infusion of occult lymphoma cells contaminating the stem cell infusate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179016836\"><span class=\"h2\">Relapsed disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vast majority of patients treated for FL will have an initial response to therapy, but virtually all of these patients will ultimately develop progressive disease requiring subsequent treatment. While relapsed disease is typically sensitive to additional therapy, the duration of remission becomes shorter with each subsequent therapy. In addition, a subset of patients will transform to a more aggressive histology. The use of HCT in relapsed FL is controversial and the subject of numerous ongoing clinical trials. Among patients with relapsed FL, we consider HCT for patients with clinically aggressive disease who have relapsed after initial treatment with a regimen that incorporates immunotherapy, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>. The use of autologous HCT in this setting is discussed in more detail below. A comparison of autologous HCT with allogeneic HCT and other treatment options is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-follicular-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H220463\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Autologous HCT may prolong progression-free and overall survival rates in a subset of patients with relapsed FL who are in complete remission or have minimal disease at the time of HCT. Support for the use of autologous HCT comes from several retrospective analyses and a single randomized trial performed prior to the development of immunotherapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>) for FL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/1-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-7</a>]. We consider autologous HCT for patients with relapsed disease, especially in those who have had short remissions (eg, significantly less than the mean progression-free survival for an individual treatment regimen, often &lt;2 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]). Since the efficacy of autologous HCT depends upon the response to chemotherapy, autologous HCT is not appropriate for chemotherapy resistant disease. Patients who relapse after autologous HCT or who have chemotherapy resistant disease may be considered for nonmyeloablative or reduced intensity allogeneic HCT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allogeneic-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-follicular-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation in follicular lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A European phase III randomized trial (the CUP trial) compared high-dose therapy followed by autologous HCT with combination chemotherapy in 89 patients with relapsed or progressive FL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. At a median follow-up of 69 months, patients treated with high-dose therapy followed by autologous HCT had the following significant outcomes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Higher progression-free survival rates at two years (55 to 58 versus 26 percent)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Higher four-year overall survival rates (71 to 77 versus 46 percent)</p><p/><p>The above study was performed before <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> was available for the treatment of FL and during an era when the median survival of patients with newly diagnosed FL was much shorter than it is with modern therapy. This study has been criticized for the small number of patients in each arm of the trial. The tremendous responses seen with rituximab treatment have made some clinicians question whether the benefit of HCT still holds true in the rituximab era.</p><p>A retrospective analysis of 254 patients with relapsed FL reported that patients treated with high dose therapy followed by autologous HCT had significantly higher rates of five-year event-free survival (51 versus 24 percent) and overall survival (70 versus 42 percent) when compared with patients who did not receive HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. When this analysis was limited to patients who received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> as part of their salvage regimen, the benefit from HCT lost its statistical significance for both five-year event-free and overall survival. However, these results have not yet been confirmed in another patient cohort, and it is unknown whether this effect would also be seen with the addition of rituximab to salvage therapy for patients initially treated with rituximab-containing therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H220470\"><span class=\"h3\">Long-term efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several mature single-institution and registry studies have reported on the long-term follow-up of autologous HCT for FL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/4,9-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9-14</a>]. Across those studies, the 10-year progression-free survival is consistently in the 30 to 50 percent range. A tantalizing result of these studies is the appearance of a plateau in the survival curves between 10 and 15 years after autologous HCT, suggesting that this procedure may be curative for one-quarter to one-third of transplanted patients. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Investigators at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and St. Bartholomew's Hospital performed a retrospective long-term analysis of 121 patients with FL undergoing autologous HCT in second or subsequent remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Compared with a historical group of patients in second remission treated with conventional therapy, those undergoing autologous HCT had a significantly longer freedom from relapse (49 versus 11 percent at 15 years) and overall survival (53 versus 30 percent at 15 years). <br/><br/>The incidence of fatal treatment-related myelodysplastic <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/acute</span> myeloid leukemia was 10 percent in those receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> plus total body irradiation followed by autologous HCT, many of whom were in complete remission from their lymphoma at the time of death. However, the finding of an apparent plateau in the remission duration curve at 48 percent at 12 years of follow-up suggests that prolonged freedom from recurrence may be achieved via this means [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Whether similar long-term survival can be obtained using chemoimmunotherapy programs is not yet known.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term results are also available from Nebraska concerning a group of 248 patients with recurrent FL who were treated with autologous HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. After a median follow-up of six years for surviving patients, five-year overall and event-free survival rates were 63 and 44 percent, respectively. The timing of transplantation appeared to affect outcome, with the best results seen in patients in first or second relapse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another single institution retrospective study of 60 patients with FL who received autologous HCT reported 16 patients with sustained long-term clinical and molecular remissions lasting up to 17.5 years. No relapses occurred more than six years following HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. &#160; </p><p/><p>Even for patients who have relapsed after autologous HCT, nonmyeloablative (reduced intensity conditioning) allogeneic HCT affords the possibility of prolonged disease-free survival.

Peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) are preferred over bone marrow harvested grafts for autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) by most groups due to quicker engraftment and a potential for less contamination of the infused cells with tumor cells. The various sources of hematopoietic stem cells are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sources of hematopoietic stem cells&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-support-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematopoietic support after hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;, section on 'Autologous PBPC transplantation'</a>.)</p><p>The University of Nebraska has reported on the results of 100 patients treated with PBPCs. Four-year failure-free and overall survivals were 44 and 65 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. There was no statistically significant difference in the outcome between patients receiving unpurged marrow and those receiving PBPCs. Similar results using PBPCs have been reported by others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Although tumor cell contamination of PBPCs is generally less than that of unpurged bone marrow, tumor cells can still be seen in PBPC preparations. In other studies, patients whose PBPC had tumor cells detectable by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tended to remain PCR positive in the bone marrow and peripheral blood after transplant and had a higher risk of relapse than those whose PBPCs were PCR negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>].</p><p>G-CSF alone and G-CSF plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> are the most common regimens used for stem cell mobilization. The choice between the two methods is mainly dependent on institutional preference and experience. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=plerixafor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Plerixafor</a> is also available for use in combination with G-CSF in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

The ideal preparative regimen prior to autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is not known. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-follicular-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A choice among preparative regimens must take into account the center's experience, the short and long term toxicities of the regimen, and the patient's comorbidities. Historically, many of the trials that incorporated HCT into the treatment of follicular lymphoma (FL) used preparative regimens with total body irradiation (TBI). A possible association between TBI and subsequent treatment-related myelodysplastic <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/acute</span> myeloid leukemia <span class=\"nowrap\">(MDS/AML)</span> has led many centers to switch to chemotherapy-only preparative regimens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F90901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90901 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparative-regimens-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preparative regimens for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;, section on 'Chemotherapy without radiation'</a>.)</p><p>However, an increased risk of second malignancies with TBI in this setting has not been confirmed and data are conflicting. A retrospective study from the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation evaluated the outcomes of 2233 patients with FL undergoing autologous HCT following conditioning with either a TBI containing regimen or with BCNU, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>, cytosine arabinoside, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melphalan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">melphalan</a> (BEAM) between 1995 and 2007 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. After a median follow-up of 73 months, the preparative regimen did not appear to impact the estimated rates of non-relapse mortality at five (6 percent) and 10 (10 percent) years. Treatment-related <span class=\"nowrap\">MDS/AML</span> was observed in 3.4 and 2.8 percent of patients receiving TBI and BEAM, respectively, at a median time to <span class=\"nowrap\">MDS/AML</span> of 50 months. </p><p>Attempts to purge the autologous graft of remaining tumor cells by using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> in the transplant setting have not demonstrated a benefit.

Approximately 24 hours after completion of the preparative chemotherapy, peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPCs) are reinfused. A period of pancytopenia follows. Red blood cell and platelet transfusions are administered as necessary while hematopoietic colony-stimulating factors (ie, G-CSF) are used to speed neutrophil engraftment. Neutrophil engraftment usually occurs by day 12 and platelet counts are expected to recover to greater than 20,000 by day 16 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/autologous-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-in-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Red blood cell transfusion requirements during autologous HCT are usually minimal.

Even though maintenance therapy is designed to have a low toxicity profile, a decision regarding the use of maintenance therapy in an individual patient must take into consideration both the potential benefit from attaining a deeper response and the likelihood that this patient will tolerate the prolonged therapy. Maintenance rituximab is associated with a higher rate of late neutropenia, infections, the reactivation of viral infections (eg, hepatitis), and blunted responsiveness to vaccination (eg, influenza vaccination). The blunted response to vaccination may be of particular concern in patients who have undergone allogeneic transplantation because they require extensive re-immunization one to two years after the transplant. </p><p>When administering maintenance <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, it is important to use one of the established regimens, such as that used in the study described above (rituximab 375 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> every two months for a total of four doses). There are no published data regarding the safety or efficacy of therapy extending beyond two years; as such, rituximab maintenance should <strong>not</strong> exceed two years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H220981\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients are seen at periodic intervals to monitor for treatment complications and assess for progression. Our approach parallels that which we use after initial treatment. This is presented in detail separately.

Patients should be encouraged to participate in these trials whenever possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High dose chemotherapy and autologous HCT (rescue) is generally reserved for patients with relapsed or refractory FL, or for those with histologic transformation to a more aggressive histology, each in the setting of chemotherapy sensitive disease. (See <a href=\"#H179016822\" class=\"local\">'Timing of transplant'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To be eligible for HCT, the patient must have normal cardiac, liver, and renal function, and have a good performance status. In general, age is not considered to be a strict exclusion criterion for autologous HCT. (See <a href=\"#H220253\" class=\"local\">'Determining transplant eligibility'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The decision of whether to proceed with HCT should be based on the patient's preference, condition, and the expected disease course. For the latter, there is no definitive score or metric. Among patients with relapsed FL, we consider HCT for patients with a remission duration significantly shorter than that expected for the initial chemotherapy regimen used. (See <a href=\"#H179016836\" class=\"local\">'Relapsed disease'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-follicular-lymphoma#H31594723\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Timing'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autologous HCT has been associated with a treatment-related mortality rate of less than 10 percent and a potential cure rate of up to 25 to 40 percent. As with other malignancies, peripheral blood progenitor cells are preferred over bone marrow harvested grafts. (See <a href=\"#H220470\" class=\"local\">'Long-term efficacy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For eligible patients who relapse after a short initial response (ie, &lt;2 year) to chemoimmunotherapy and demonstrate chemotherapy sensitive disease, we suggest autologous HCT rather than treatment with chemoimmunotherapy alone or allogeneic HCT (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H220463\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-follicular-lymphoma#H31594622\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Transplantation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In this same population, we suggest maintenance <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> following autologous HCT rather than observation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This preference places a high value on a higher progression-free survival rate with unknown overall survival benefit following rituximab maintenance with the understanding that rituximab maintenance places the patient at risk for infections.
