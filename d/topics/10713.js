These ER-positive tumors are dependent on the ER and its cognate ligand, estrogen, for their growth, survival, and progression. Three major classes of endocrine therapy drugs, which differ by their basic mechanism of action, are in use for the treatment <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prevention of ER-positive breast cancers. These therapies are all designed in one way or another to block ER function and signaling. Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) and selective estrogen receptor down-regulators (SERDs), the focus of this topic, are competitive inhibitors of estrogen binding to ERs. How SERMs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raloxifene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">raloxifene</a> and <span class=\"nowrap\">SERM/SERD</span> hybrid (SSH) agents can have both antagonist and agonist actions on the ER in different tissues and the distinctive mechanisms of action of SERDs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fulvestrant-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fulvestrant</a> and new oral SERDs will be reviewed here. The emphasis will be on the effects of tamoxifen and SERDs on breast cancer. Additional material on the physiology of estrogen and ERs is presented elsewhere.

However, the ER appears to be predominantly nuclear both in the presence and absence of hormone. The ER operates as a ligand-dependent transcription factor; attachment of estrogen to the ER's ligand-binding domain results in either direct binding of the ER to estrogen response elements (ERE) in the promoter of target genes or to a protein-protein interaction with other transcription factors at their respective promoter sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-action-of-selective-estrogen-receptor-modulators-and-down-regulators/abstract/32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-35</a>].</p><p>Subsequently, the hormone-receptor complex is able to bind to estrogen-specific response elements that activate or repress expression of genes whose protein products are responsible for the physiologic actions of the hormone.</p><p>The ER shares many structural features with other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily with six components or &quot;domains,&quot; A to F (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F59876\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59876 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-action-of-selective-estrogen-receptor-modulators-and-down-regulators/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].

The sequence-specific DNA binding function of the ER requires dimerization and resides in domain C. Domain D contains a nuclear localization signal. Regions that promote transcription activation functions are present in domains <span class=\"nowrap\">A/B</span> (AF1) and E (AF2).

However, it is likely that the change in receptor conformation that follows binding of the ER by a SERM results in variable interactions with cofactors that are required for ER-mediated gene regulation. These nuclear proteins, termed coactivators and corepressors, are able to interpret the difference between binding of different ligands (eg, estrogen or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a>) to the ER. Coactivators increase the transcriptional activity of the ER by promoting an interaction between the receptor and the transcriptional apparatus that provides the machinery for gene activation and subsequent mRNA transcription [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-action-of-selective-estrogen-receptor-modulators-and-down-regulators/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

As a result, there is likely to be significant cross-resistance between tamoxifen and raloxifene, resulting in a relative lack of activity of raloxifene in tamoxifen-refractory breast cancer. The differing effects of raloxifene and tamoxifen on the uterus may be related to structural differences in the two compounds that influence the conformations of the ligand-receptor complexes, thereby determining which estrogen-responsive genes are modulated in specific tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-action-of-selective-estrogen-receptor-modulators-and-down-regulators/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p>Alternatively, differences in tissue specificity compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> may be related to other unique aspects of the interaction of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raloxifene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">raloxifene</a> with the ER.

Activation is mediated by a polypurine sequence, termed the raloxifene response element (RFE), and does not require the DNA-binding domain of the estrogen receptor.

This evidence, which suggests that ER remains a viable therapeutic target in these resistant breast cancers, inspired the development of selective estrogen receptor down-regulator (SERD) agents, which degrade and eliminate the ER protein.</p><p>SERDs, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fulvestrant-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fulvestrant</a>, are distinguishable from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> and other SERMs both by their pharmacology and by their mechanisms of action (MOA). Fulvestrant is a high-affinity competitive antagonist of ER. Due to its similarity to the endogenous estrogen ligand, fulvestrant competes with estrogen binding to the LBD of ER. However, its long hydrophobic side chain confers fulvestrant with unique antiestrogenic properties. Fulvestrant binding to the ER, similar to other ER ligands and SERMs, causes dissociation of the receptor from its heat-shock chaperone proteins. However, because of its long side chain, receptor dimerization is sterically hindered and rapid proteasome-dependent ER degradation is induced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-action-of-selective-estrogen-receptor-modulators-and-down-regulators/abstract/14,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,65</a>]. Rapid degradation of ER following treatment with fulvestrant seems to play an important role in the abrogation of both ligand-dependent (induced by estrogen or SERMs) and ligand-independent (eg, induced by hyperactive growth factor signaling or by <em>ESR1</em> mutants) ER activity and signaling. Thus, the unique MOA of fulvestrant is probably accountable for the drug efficacy observed preclinically <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> clinically, especially in the treatment of tumors that have developed resistance to prior tamoxifen or AI treatments or those that harbor constitutively active<em> ESR1</em> mutants.</p><p>Unfortunately, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fulvestrant-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fulvestrant</a>&rsquo;s poor pharmaceutical properties that prevent oral administration have limited its usefulness and potency.

Resistance to tamoxifen under chronic exposure stems from the selection of a subpopulation of cells that express a compatible coactivator(s) that directs the pharmacologic switch of tamoxifen from an antagonist to an agonist. SERDs, such as GDC-0810, have activity in this setting because (1) they function as high affinity competitive antagonists, and (2) they induce a conformational change in the ER that does not support the exposure of the coregulator (coactivator) binding surface required for the agonist activity of estrogen and tamoxifen, but instead exposes a surface on the receptor that targets it for proteasome-dependent degradation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-action-of-selective-estrogen-receptor-modulators-and-down-regulators/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

In addition, the estrogen agonist activity of tamoxifen in the endometrium requires a high level of SRC-1 expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-action-of-selective-estrogen-receptor-modulators-and-down-regulators/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].<br/><br/>Differences in <span class=\"nowrap\">coactivator/corepressor</span> status among tumors may also help explain the variable response to tamoxifen in the primary treatment of ER-positive, metastatic breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanisms-of-action-of-selective-estrogen-receptor-modulators-and-down-regulators/abstract/49,72,78,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,72,78,79</a>]. In addition, corepressor and coactivator expression levels may influence the development of secondary resistance to tamoxifen.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How an individual SERM can act as an ER agonist in one tissue and as an antagonist in another is not firmly established. However, it is likely that the change in receptor conformation that follows binding of the ER by a SERM results in variable interactions with cofactors that are required for ER-mediated gene regulation in different tissues. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Corepressors and coactivators'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Estrogen receptor beta: A second ER isoform'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The newer SERMs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raloxifene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">raloxifene</a> appear to have different tissue-specific effects from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a>. The differing effects of raloxifene and tamoxifen on the uterus may be related to structural differences that influence which estrogen-responsive genes are modulated in specific tissues. Tamoxifen induces endometrial hyperplasia, an estrogen agonist effect, and increases the risk of developing endometrial cancer. Raloxifene does not appear to have endometrioid agonistic effects; unlike tamoxifen, it does not increase the risk of uterine cancers. Raloxifene has only been used for prevention, and should not be substituted for tamoxifen in the adjuvant or metastatic setting. (See <a href=\"#H1630272774\" class=\"local\">'Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs)'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1869104771\" class=\"local\">'Raloxifene'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not all breast cancers respond to SERMs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a>. Resistance to tamoxifen therapy may be intrinsic (de novo), in which ER-negative and many ER-positive tumors do not respond to tamoxifen at the outset of therapy, or acquired, where ER-positive tumors that initially responded to tamoxifen subsequently exploit the <span class=\"nowrap\">tamoxifen/ER</span> complex as a stimulatory rather than inhibitory growth signal. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deep sequencing studies suggest a relatively common mechanism of acquired SERM resistance may be the acquisition of a somatic mutation in <em>ESR1</em> that causes an amino acid change in the ER ligand-binding domain (LBD), resulting in a constitutively active ER conformation. However, the clinical implications of this finding for treatment of women with ER-positive breast cancer have not yet been determined. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two antiestrogens with mixed <span class=\"nowrap\">SERM/selective</span> estrogen receptor down-regulator (SERD) activity, bazedoxifene and pipdendoxifene, have shown efficacy in preclinical models of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a> resistance, with bazedoxifene demonstrating activity against a model expressing the <em>ESR1</em>-Y537S mutation. However, the clinical implications of these findings have not yet been determined. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of factors contribute to intrinsic resistance, including variable expression of the ER-alpha and beta isoforms, interference with binding of coactivators and corepressors, alternatively spliced ER mRNA variants, and modulation of ER activity through increased expression of growth factors. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Intrinsic resistance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tamoxifen</a> requires the cytochrome P450 CYP2D6 for conversion to one of its active metabolites.
