It is unclear if sexual pain is a sexual disorder, pain disorder, or both. It can be difficult to identify a definitive cause of pain. Etiologies range from simple anatomic problems to complex biopsychosocial issues. In addition, a woman can have more than one etiology of her pain.</p><p>This topic will review the epidemiology, etiology, and diagnostic evaluation of women who present with genital sexual pain.

Sexual pain can be mild to severe, generalized or localized, lifelong or acquired, and idiopathic or secondary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-woman-with-sexual-pain/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The pain can be present for any amount of time. FSP encompasses identifiable conditions that cause genital pain (eg, endometriosis, genitourinary syndrome of menopause, dermatoses) as well as generalized pain disorders such as pains with sexual activity, dyspareunia (pain with penetrative intercourse), vulvodynia (persistent vulvar pain of without an identifiable etiology), and vaginismus (difficulty in allowing vaginal penetration despite willingness to do so) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-woman-with-sexual-pain/abstract/1,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2744512876\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple classification systems have been proposed to define FSP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-woman-with-sexual-pain/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. One challenge for classification is that sexual dysfunction has typically been viewed as being either psychiatric or medical when, in reality, both factors have a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-woman-with-sexual-pain/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This duality is reflected by the simultaneous use of two official systems with international influence: the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5<sup>th</sup> edition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-woman-with-sexual-pain/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] and the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases, 10<sup>th</sup> revision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-woman-with-sexual-pain/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>In 2015, in attempt to standardize the definitions to facilitate research and communication, the Fourth International Consultation on Sexual Medicine (ICSM) reviewed the existing systems and classified FSP as female genital-pelvic pain dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-woman-with-sexual-pain/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Women with genital-pelvic pain dysfunction must have persistent or recurring challenges with at least one of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain with vaginal penetration during intercourse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Marked vulvovaginal or pelvic pain during genital contact (ie, genital sexual pain)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Marked fear or anxiety about vulvovaginal or pelvic pain in anticipation of, during, or as a result of genital contact</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Marked hypertonicity of overactivity of pelvic floor muscles with or without genital contact (ie, vaginismus)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H589976730\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2822610701\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence and prevalence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reported incidence and prevalence estimates for female sexual dysfunction and pain are challenging to determine as they vary with culture, patient age, definition of sexual dysfunction or pain, study design, and outcome measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-woman-with-sexual-pain/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. The incidence of female sexual dysfunction, which includes FSP, has been reported to range from 6 to 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-woman-with-sexual-pain/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. A systematic review of 54 studies reported the incidence of painful intercourse, one type of FSP, ranged from 8 to 22 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-woman-with-sexual-pain/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], while the prevalence of painful intercourse has been reported to range from 1 to 27 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-woman-with-sexual-pain/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2904858780\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The biopsychosocial model suggests that risks factors for sexual dysfunction include biological, psychological, and sociocultural factors. The risk factors also vary with the type of FSP. Examples include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dyspareunia: Risk factors for dyspareunia include pelvic inflammatory disease, depression, anxiety, history of sexual abuse, black race, peri- or postmenopausal status, and age &lt;50 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-woman-with-sexual-pain/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Although menopausal status and age &lt;50 years appear to be somewhat exclusive, the study did not further elucidate these findings.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vulvodynia: Risk factors for vulvodynia, persistent vulvar pain without an identifiable etiology, include anxiety and depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-woman-with-sexual-pain/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. It is not known how these illnesses contribute to FSP. Questionnaire studies suggest both childhood sexual and physical abuse are risk factors for the development of vulvodynia and sexual pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-woman-with-sexual-pain/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. In one study, women with vulvodynia were 4 times more likely to report a history of physical abuse and 6.5 times more likely to report a history of sexual abuse compared with women without vulvodynia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-woman-with-sexual-pain/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The mechanism by which this early childhood victimization and trauma contributes to the modulation of pain is not yet understood.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4287832056\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sexual pain has many causes. Similar to the classification system for vulvar pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-woman-with-sexual-pain/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], women with FSP can be grouped into those with an identifiable cause of their symptoms and those with idiopathic FSP. For women with FSP related to a specific cause, the pathogenesis of pain is related to that diagnosis. Women with FSP and no identifiable cause appear to have a type of chronic pain syndrome. Women can have both identified and idiopathic FSP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H345452420\"><span class=\"h2\">Identifiable</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anatomic</strong> &ndash; Anatomic causes of FSP include myofascial pelvic pain syndrome, and, less often, M&uuml;llerian anomalies and pelvic organ prolapse. The vulvar vestibule has nonvisceral innervation, similar to cutaneous tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-woman-with-sexual-pain/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The most sensitive portion of the vagina is the area contiguous with the vestibule because the distal vagina has a greater number of pain fibers than the proximal vagina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-woman-with-sexual-pain/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The mechanism by which myofascial pelvic pain syndrome causes pain is presented separately.

In addition, endometriosis and the resulting inflammation, fibrosis, and adhesion formation can cause chronic pain as well as deep pelvic pain with sexual activity.

In addition, estrogen is critical for maintaining the overall integrity of the vaginal tissue.&nbsp;It is estimated that at least 50 percent of postmenopausal women have vaginal atrophy as a result of decreased estrogen levels.

In women without a history of abuse, women who have regularly experienced pain during intercourse can report a marked fear or anxiety about FSP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-woman-with-sexual-pain/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This appropriate reaction to pain may lead to avoidance of sexual activity. Other women can have a fear or anxiety response without having had a history of pain itself. Such fear can also lead to voluntary, or involuntary, tensing of the vaginal muscles that results in pain with vaginal penetration (ie, vaginismus). In addition, psychiatric illnesses such as depression and anxiety are independently associated with chronic pain, including sexual pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-woman-with-sexual-pain/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

During physical examination, the pain is mapped and the anatomy is inspected for possible causes of the symptoms. The results of the history and physical examination guide the selection of laboratory or imaging studies. Some women then undergo further diagnostic procedures.</p><p>It is the responsibility of the health care provider to initiate a conversation about sexual concerns because the woman may be reluctant to discuss sexual problems for fear of patronization, judgement, or dismissal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-woman-with-sexual-pain/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Communication skills that enhance openness, comfort, trust, and confidence are especially important.

We use an anatomic drawing as a visual aid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72614\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72614 \">figure 1</a>). Alternately, the woman can point to the concerning regions during the physical examination; this approach can be helpful for the woman who is unable to localize the pain and responds that &quot;everything hurts.&quot; Questions that we ask include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Is the pain on the vulva (labia majora, labia minora, interlabial sulci, clitoral or periclitoral, or in the vestibule)? Pain in these locations may reflect lichen dermatoses, contact dermatitis, or generalized vulvodynia.

In addition, an adverse experience can all lead to remembered pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-prevention-and-treatment-of-radiation-induced-fibrosis#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, prevention, and treatment of radiation-induced fibrosis&quot;, section on 'Genitourinary tract'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-early-stage-cervical-cancer#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of early-stage cervical cancer&quot;, section on 'Sexual dysfunction'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>What is the character and pattern of the pain?</strong> &ndash; Is it a sharp or burning or tingling sensation? For how long does each episode last? How severe is it? We use a visual analogue scale that can help the woman quantify her pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F62346\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62346 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We also inquire how the pain changes during the menstrual cycle. Cyclic symptoms of deep dyspareunia may indicate the presence of endometriosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H3234103847\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Does the pain occur or worsen when you are sitting or exercising?</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>This may reflect pudendal nerve dysfunction or pudendal neuralgia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-sexual-pain-in-women#H4840150\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of sexual pain in women&quot;, section on 'Pudendal neuralgia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-hip-and-groin-pain-in-the-athlete-and-active-adult#H283782\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to hip and groin pain in the athlete and active adult&quot;, section on 'Neuropathies'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>What have you tried to relieve the pain?</strong> &ndash; We inquire about evaluations and treatments, including self-initiated (eg, vaginal lubricant, position changes), that the patient has tried. We ask what has helped and what has not.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2111152793\"><span class=\"h3\">Sexual</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Was there a period of pain-free, enjoyable sexual intercourse followed by the development of the pain?</strong> &ndash; Ask the patient follow-up questions to create a timeline from pain-free sexual activity to the development of pain. Lifelong sexual pain can reflect a congenital anomaly or undiagnosed or untreated vulvovaginal disorders (eg, lichen sclerosus) with architectural changes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> scarring of the introitus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and management of congenital anomalies of the vagina&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvar-lichen-sclerosus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vulvar lichen sclerosus&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>What has happened since the pain started?</strong> &ndash; We inquire if the pain has continued with every sexual encounter and with subsequent partners. This information can help identify specific partners or sexual practices that contribute to the pain. We also ask if the woman avoids sexual activity because of the pain. Avoidance of sexual contact speaks to the magnitude of her symptoms and can also contribute to relationship stress, which can further worsen pain. If the woman is able to tolerate sexual activity despite the pain, we ask how often and in which circumstances she has been able to do so. Some women engage in anal intercourse to avoid vaginal intercourse. In addition, we ask if the patient finds any topical lubricants, alcohol consumption, or drug consumption helpful.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tell me about you first sexual experience.</strong> &ndash; We discuss the patient's first sexual experience. We explain to patients that we find the following questions helpful because, in our clinical experience, inadequate development of intimate relationships and poor sexual technique, or actual trauma, can lead to remembered pain and tightening of the pelvic floor with every subsequent episode.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Had she known the partner long enough to develop a relationship? </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Was sex desired? Was she stimulated, aroused, and lubricated for sex? </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Did she have pain? Was the pain more than she expected? </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Was complete penetration possible?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1461221961\"><span class=\"h3\">Relationship</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>How would you describe your relationship with your partner(s)? Is there anything you would like to discuss with me?</strong> &ndash; This area of questioning can be particularly personal and upsetting to a patient. Some women may find it surprising that the clinician is delving into this emotional area. We explain that understanding this part of her experience is extremely important to improving her sexual health. Women with significant relationship stress can benefit from referral to a relationship counselor or sexual therapist. Questions that we find helpful include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Are there any sexual or relationship issues between you or your partner?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Do you and your partner argue about the change in your sex life?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Does your partner believe that your pain is real?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Is there adequate sexual knowledge and technique?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Are you safe in your current relationships? Have you ever been abused?</strong> &ndash; Sexual abuse has been associated with the development of chronic pelvic pain and sexual pain disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-woman-with-sexual-pain/abstract/21,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,23</a>]. Globally, 30 percent of women have experienced physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-woman-with-sexual-pain/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Therefore, we screen all women for intimate partner violence. Women who are currently unsafe are referred for immediate intervention. Once the woman is safe, she can be fully evaluated for other etiologies of sexual pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intimate-partner-violence-diagnosis-and-screening\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intimate partner violence: Diagnosis and screening&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intimate-partner-violence-intervention-and-patient-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intimate partner violence: Intervention and patient management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">While screening for intimate partner violence or past violence is an important aspect of the sexual pain evaluation, it is important to remember that trauma comes in many forms &#160;As an example, conflict over bladder or bowels during childhood can lead to lifelong dysfunctional voiding or chronic constipation with associated pelvic floor hypertonicity, spasm, and dyspareunia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-woman-with-sexual-pain/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2734872184\"><span class=\"h3\">Additional gynecologic and medical issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the above questions, we take focused gynecologic and medical histories to identify all possible factors contributing to sexual pain. Components of the gynecologic history are presented in detail separately.

Urethral disorders (diverticulum, urethritis, cyst) can cause pain during vaginal penetration or thrusting.

Crohn disease can also present with vulvar lesions that can be an independent source of pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F73032\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73032 \">picture 2</a>). Other intestinal dysfunction, such as irritable bowel syndrome or chronic constipation, can impair the pelvic floor muscle function and result in pain.

All of these can contribute to pelvic floor muscle hypertonus or dysfunction which in turn contribute to FSP. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myofascial-pelvic-pain-syndrome-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of myofascial pelvic pain syndrome in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dermatologic</strong> &ndash; We inquire about a history of dermatitis, including skin conditions that can affect the vulva such as eczema, allergies, and contact dermatitis. We ask about use of over-the-counter feminine products, soaps, cleansing wipes, and similar products that can result in drying and irritation of the vulva. Some women develop a contact dermatitis.

Pressure-point testing is performed first so that the findings are not distorted by the palpation portion of the examination.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pressure-point testing</strong> &ndash; In pressure-point testing, the clinician systematically touches the woman's external anatomy with a moistened cotton swab and assesses for pain or other abnormal sensations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72614\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72614 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F105910\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105910 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-woman-with-sexual-pain/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

The patient should be notified before testing the vulvar vestibule because this area is a common source of pain. The vestibule is examined in a clockwise fashion with the cotton swab from the clitoral frenulum in its anterior trigone, around circumferentially within Hart's line, imagining the face of a clock (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F105677\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105677 \">picture 3</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The patient's permission is requested before moving to each area unless the examiner is trying to assess for the loss of sensation in addition to pain. At each test site, the sensation is graded using a 10-point visual analog pain scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F82442\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef82442 \">form 1</a>). With the cotton swab, the clinician also assesses the clitoris and bulbocavernosus reflexes (to assess function or dysfunction of the sacral nerve roots) and notes if the response is exaggerated, minimized, or absent. In addition, the clinician visually assesses the appearance of all the tissues at the time of pain mapping. Findings suggestive of localized vulvar pain syndrome include can include erythema and pain out of proportion to touch in the vulvar vestibule, but it is important to note that erythema is not required for the diagnosis of localized vulvar pain syndrome.

The examiner evaluates for labial lesions (eg, ulcerations, fissures), labial hypertrophy, vaginal agenesis, and imperforate hymen. If available, use of a colposcope (without acetic acid) to magnify the vulva may provide more detailed information, but is not an essential component of the examination.

Proceeding with gentle manipulation of the tissues that appear normal on visual inspection can identify findings such as small fissures, masses (eg, neuroma), tender scars, and adhesions that may not have been seen.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2728793970\"><span class=\"h3\">Vagina and cervix</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The speculum examination of the vagina and cervix can be extremely stressful for women with FSP and thus may require a separate visit to complete. A variety of speculum shapes and sizes should be available to maximize the patient's comfort; a pediatric Grave&rsquo;s or narrow Pederson speculum can be extremely helpful. Prior to the examination, the speculum is warmed and lubricated (water can be used for women with sensitivity to lubricants). A medical assistant can facilitate the collection and labeling of any samples and can thereby make the examination proceed more quickly.</p><p>Women with introital pain can benefit from a topical anesthetic (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> ointment 5% or lidocaine 2.5% and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prilocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prilocaine</a> 2.5%) in a maximum dose of 5 gm applied to the introitus approximately 10 minutes prior to the speculum examination. Point-pressure testing is completed prior to application of any anesthetic agent. If topical anesthetic is unavailable, then the clinician should avoid touching the vestibule during speculum insertion.

Sexual pain can be mild to severe, generalized or localized, lifelong or acquired, and idiopathic or secondary. (See <a href=\"#H209310454\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Fourth International Consultation on Sexual Medicine (ICSM) classifies FSP as female genital-pelvic pain dysfunction. (See <a href=\"#H2744512876\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with genital-pelvic pain dysfunction must have persistent or recurring challenges with at least one of the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Vaginal penetration during intercourse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Marked vulvovaginal or pelvic pain during genital contact (ie, genital sexual pain)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Marked fear or anxiety about vulvovaginal or pelvic pain in anticipation of, during, or as a result of genital contact</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Marked hypertonicity of overactivity of pelvic floor muscles with or without genital contact (ie, vaginismus)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incidence and prevalence estimates for FSP range widely because they vary with culture, patient age, definition of sexual dysfunction or pain, study design, and outcome measures. Risk factors for sexual dysfunction include biological, psychological, and sociocultural factors. (See <a href=\"#H589976730\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with FSP can be grouped into those with an identifiable cause of their symptoms and those with idiopathic FSP. Women with FSP and no identifiable cause appear to have a type of chronic pain syndrome. Women can have both identified and idiopathic FSP. (See <a href=\"#H4287832056\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain with genital sexual contact is the hallmark symptom of women with FSP. Common sites of pain include the vulva, vaginal vestibule, introitus, vagina, pelvis, or pelvic floor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72614\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72614 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3261403803\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All women with sexual pain undergo a detailed history and physical examination. The purpose of the history is to evaluate for possible physical, sexual, and psychosocial origins of pain. During physical examination, the pain is mapped and the anatomy is inspected for possible causes of the symptoms. The results of the history and physical examination guide the selection of laboratory or imaging studies. Some women then undergo further diagnostic procedures. (See <a href=\"#H1245296519\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Women who do not go through this evaluation and are referred directly for specialty care include women in current unsafe relationships, women with possible graft versus host disease, and women who have undergone female genital cutting (circumcision). (See <a href=\"#H742996829\" class=\"local\">'Indications for prompt referral'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Before the examination, the clinician asks the patient about previous experiences with the pelvic examination and obtains verbal consent. The woman is offered additional measure to reduce anxiety and discomfort. (See <a href=\"#H1488061316\" class=\"local\">'Patient comfort'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common identifiable causes of FSP in premenopausal women are provoked vulvar pain syndrome (vestibulodynia, vulvodynia), myofascial pelvic pain syndrome, and interstitial <span class=\"nowrap\">cystitis/painful</span> bladder syndrome. In postmenopausal women, vulvar dermatologic conditions (infectious, hormonal, and autoimmune), endometriosis, and genitourinary syndrome of menopause are the most common causes of sexual pain. (See <a href=\"#H3026044274\" class=\"local\">'Common scenarios'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H720017740\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Elizabeth Gunther Stewart, MD, and Roya Rezaee, MD, FACOG, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-woman-with-sexual-pain/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Fugl-Meyer KS, Bohm-Starke N, Damsted Petersen C, et al.
