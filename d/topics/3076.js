The identification of primary amenorrhea should always prompt a thorough evaluation to identify a cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-primary-amenorrhea/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. At age 13 years, if no menses have occurred and there is a complete absence of secondary sexual characteristics such as breast development, evaluation for primary amenorrhea should begin. In addition, some girls with secondary sexual characteristics may present before age 15 years with amenorrhea and cyclic pelvic pain. These girls should be evaluated for possible outflow tract obstruction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H272346641\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary amenorrhea is usually the result of a genetic or anatomical abnormality.

In addition, steroid receptor abnormalities and deficiencies in enzymes of steroidogenesis cause primary amenorrhea at the level of the ovary and the adrenal gland.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H272346661\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypothalamic and pituitary disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypothalamic causes of primary amenorrhea are functional hypothalamic amenorrhea and isolated GnRH deficiency. Less commonly, tumors and infiltrative lesions of the hypothalamus or pituitary can result in amenorrhea, usually in association with hyperprolactinemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F59801\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59801 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H272346684\"><span class=\"h3\">Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea is a disorder that, by definition, excludes pathologic disease. It is characterized by abnormal hypothalamic GnRH secretion leading to decreased gonadotropin pulsations, low or normal serum luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations, absent LH surges, absence of normal follicular development, anovulation, and low serum concentrations of estradiol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-primary-amenorrhea/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations are often in the normal range, with a high FSH-to-LH ratio similar to the pattern in prepubertal girls.</p><p>Multiple factors may contribute to the pathogenesis of functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, including eating disorders (such as anorexia nervosa), exercise, and stress. The term hypothalamic amenorrhea is often used interchangeably with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea. The topic of functional hypothalamic amenorrhea is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-hypothalamic-amenorrhea-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea: Pathophysiology and clinical manifestations&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eating-disorders-overview-of-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eating disorders: Overview of epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-causes-of-secondary-amenorrhea#H689399617\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and causes of secondary amenorrhea&quot;, section on 'Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H272346738\"><span class=\"h3\">Isolated GnRH deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although rare, primary amenorrhea can be due to complete congenital gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) deficiency. This syndrome is called idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism or, if it is associated with anosmia, Kallmann syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-primary-amenorrhea/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. These women typically have apulsatile and prepubertal low serum gonadotropin concentrations due to the absence of hypothalamic GnRH. This disorder is often difficult to distinguish clinically from constitutional delay of puberty. Isolated GnRH deficiency can be inherited as an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked condition. To date, a number of genes have been implicated in the etiology of isolated GnRH deficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isolated-gonadotropin-releasing-hormone-deficiency-idiopathic-hypogonadotropic-hypogonadism#H372819954\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Isolated gonadotropin-releasing hormone deficiency (idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism)&quot;, section on 'Genetics'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H272346770\"><span class=\"h3\">Constitutional delay of puberty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Constitutional delay of puberty is common in boys with a family history of delayed puberty, but it is fivefold less common in girls. Constitutional delay is characterized by both delayed adrenarche and gonadarche, and it is often difficult to distinguish clinically from congenital GnRH deficiency. Patients with constitutional delay go on to have completely normal pubertal development, albeit at a later age. Because constitutional delay of puberty is uncommon in girls, it should be a diagnosis of exclusion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-delayed-puberty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of delayed puberty&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H272346788\"><span class=\"h3\">Hyperprolactinemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperprolactinemia is a common cause of secondary amenorrhea but an uncommon cause of primary amenorrhea. The presentation is similar to hypothalamic amenorrhea except for the additional finding of galactorrhea in some patients.

Stress, sleep, exercise, intercourse, and meals can raise serum prolactin concentrations transiently. Thus, we recommend that high serum prolactin concentrations be recorded at least twice before magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is ordered.

The main indications for MRI are hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, visual field defects, headaches, other evidence of hypothalamic or pituitary dysfunction, or symptoms suggestive of other diseases (such as sarcoidosis).

Examples include celiac disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, and inflammatory bowel disease.

These disorders result in premature depletion of all ovarian oocytes and follicles. These women have significantly elevated FSH levels due to the absence of ovarian oocytes and follicles, leading to reduced negative feedback on FSH from estradiol and inhibin B. The largest number of patients have Turner syndrome (45,X as well as other karyotypes), followed by 46,XX gonadal dysgenesis and, rarely, 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Turner syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H272346836\"><span class=\"h3\">Turner syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with Turner syndrome are missing all of one X chromosome in 55 to 60 percent of cases (45,X gonadal dysgenesis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-primary-amenorrhea/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Amenorrhea occurs because the oocytes and follicles undergo accelerated apoptosis (in utero in most cases). The ovaries are replaced with fibrous tissue, and in the absence of follicles, there is no ovarian estrogen secretion. In contrast, the external female genitalia, uterus, and fallopian tubes develop normally until puberty when estrogen-induced maturation fails to occur. Spontaneous puberty and menstruation occur more commonly in women with a mosaic karyotype <span class=\"nowrap\">(45,X/46,XX)</span> but can occur in women with a 45,X karyotype, although spontaneous pregnancy is unlikely with a 45,X karyotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-primary-amenorrhea/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Women with Turner syndrome whose karyotype includes a Y chromosome (such as <span class=\"nowrap\">45,X/46,XY</span> mosaicism) are at increased risk for gonadoblastoma, a neoplasm that occurs in dysgenetic gonads.

There are syndromic forms associated with hearing loss (Perrault syndrome). It is increasingly recognized that homozygous mutations in genes coding proteins responsible for homologous recombination in meiosis and DNA damage and repair cause XX gonadal dysgenesis in the absence of other syndromic features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-primary-amenorrhea/abstract/11-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-16</a>].

In complete 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis, the fibrous streak gonad cannot secrete anti-m&uuml;llerian hormone (AMH). This results in persistent m&uuml;llerian structures and a female phenotype. The phenotype of partial gonadal dysgenesis can range from genital ambiguity to an undervirilized male. Mutations in <em>SRY</em>, <em>FOG2</em><span class=\"nowrap\">/<em>ZFPM2,</em></span> and <em>WNT1</em> have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-primary-amenorrhea/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Because of the phenotypic variability, some patients are diagnosed in infancy with ambiguous genitalia, while others are not diagnosed until puberty when they present with primary amenorrhea.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2486729321\"><span class=\"h3\">Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>46,XX primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is defined as the development of clinical menopause before the age of 40 years in women who have a normal karyotype. POI usually presents as secondary amenorrhea and can be due to chemotherapy or radiation, autoimmune oophoritis, an <em>FMR1</em> premutation, or a number of mutations. Although most women present with secondary amenorrhea, some present with primary amenorrhea.

The menstrual disturbances in women with PCOS classically have a peripubertal onset. The women with PCOS who present with primary amenorrhea typically have higher androgen levels and are more overweight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-primary-amenorrhea/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, most have a slightly early menarche related to overweight, followed by irregular cycles (oligomenorrhea) or secondary amenorrhea. The diagnosis can be made in a girl with clinical and biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism in the presence of advanced pubertal development (ie, greater than or equal to Tanner stage 4 breast development) and in the absence of other disorders causing amenorrhea and hyperandrogenism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-primary-amenorrhea/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

It may be associated with cyclic pelvic pain and a perirectal mass from sequestration of blood in the vagina (hematocolpos). Similar findings can be seen with defects in perineal development, which can result in absence of the distal third of the vagina and therefore absence of an outflow tract. Both of these conditions are diagnosed by physical examination. An imperforate hymen is easily corrected with surgery.

It is usually accompanied by cervical and uterine agenesis; however, 7 to 10 percent of women have a normal but obstructed or rudimentary uterus with functional endometrium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69536\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69536 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80263\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80263 \">figure 2</a>). The defect results from agenesis or hypoplasia of the m&uuml;llerian duct system. Heterozygous mutations in <em>WNT4</em> account for a small subset of these cases. The most commonly cited incidence for vaginal agenesis is 1 in 5000 (range: 1 per 4000 to 10,000 females).

These patients are resistant to testosterone due to a defect in the androgen receptor and, therefore, fail to develop all of the male sexual characteristics that are dependent upon testosterone. The external genitalia are typically female in appearance, but testes may be palpable in the labia or inguinal area. The testes make m&uuml;llerian-inhibiting substance, which is functional and causes regression of all m&uuml;llerian structures: the fallopian tubes, uterus, and upper third of the vagina. At puberty, breast development occurs, but the areolae are pale and pubic and axillary hair is sparse. Carrier females (46,XX) develop normal internal and external genitalia.

The testes should be surgically excised after puberty because of the increased risk (2 to 5 percent) of developing testicular cancer after age 25 years.

At birth, these neonates may appear female or have ambiguous genitalia due to an inability to convert testosterone (via 5-alpha-reductase) to its more potent metabolite dihydrotestosterone (DHT). At puberty, the disorder is more recognizable because of the onset of virilization (male-pattern hair growth, increased muscle mass, and voice deepening) due to the normal peripubertal increase in testosterone secretion in males. However, these individuals do not undergo DHT-dependent masculinization (enlargement of the male external genitalia and prostate).

As a result, there is decreased cortisol synthesis but overproduction of corticotropin (ACTH), corticosterone, and deoxycorticosterone. Adrenal and gonadal sex steroids are not produced, so that affected subjects typically present as phenotypic females with hypertension (due to mineralocorticoid excess), lack of pubertal development, and either female (if 46,XX) or incompletely developed (if 46,XY) external genitalia.

Oxidoreductase deficiency has two unique clinical features. First, affected neonates may present with severe undervirilization in boys and severe virilization in girls. In addition, patients may present with a complex, predominantly craniofacial pattern, termed Antley-Bixler syndrome. The spectrum of <em>POR</em> mutations has expanded and includes women with primary amenorrhea and infertility. Women might present with a pattern of atypical congenital adrenal hyperplasia upon ACTH stimulation, including low cortisol and androstenedione levels and elevated 17-hydroxyprogesterone and progesterone levels. Women may also present with amenorrhea in the setting of multiple large ovarian cysts but low estradiol levels.

She presented with very high serum estradiol concentrations (3500 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> [12,849 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L]),</span> inappropriately elevated serum gonadotropins (LH 9.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL,</span> FSH 6.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL),</span> enlarged multicystic ovaries, and no evidence of endometrial thickening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-primary-amenorrhea/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In spite of the hyperestrogenemia, she had normal serum concentrations of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), cortisol-binding globulin (CBG), thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), and triglycerides. She also had delayed bone age (13.5 years), low bone mineral density (BMD) (Z-score -2.4), and her growth velocity chart suggested a lack of an estrogen-induced adolescent growth spurt. DNA sequencing identified a homozygous mutation in <em>ESR1</em> that severely impaired estrogen signaling except with administration of pharmacologic doses of estrogen, when minimal signaling was observed. The prevalence of <em>ESR1</em> mutations in humans is unknown, but they are likely to be very rare. Although they have not been identified clinically, milder <em>ESR1</em> mutations could result in incomplete estrogen resistance analogous to the partial androgen insensitivity syndrome caused by mild mutations in the androgen receptor gene.
