However, more than 85 percent of patients with Crohn disease (CD) have no family history of IBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic susceptibility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of observations in both humans and animal models suggest that genetically determined factors contribute to IBD susceptibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p><strong> &#160;Animal models</strong> &mdash; The ability to delete or modify genes selectively (such as interleukin [IL]-10) in animal models has contributed to the understanding of the genetic loci that may be involved in IBD pathogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. These experiments have revealed several important observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Colitis is a relatively nonspecific phenotype that can result from alterations in a variety of genes. Genes affecting both the adaptive and innate immune system as well as epithelial function can lead to intestinal inflammation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A single genetic alteration can be associated with a variable clinical presentation, depending upon the specific strain of mice used, suggesting that the actual phenotype results from interactions among multiple genetic loci.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lack of colitis observed in numerous susceptible strains with genetic alterations when maintained in germ-free environments demonstrates that the genes confer disease susceptibility, but actual disease is dependent upon the presence of microorganisms.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Human studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IBD appears to follow a non-Mendelian pattern of inheritance in most affected individuals.</p><p>The most compelling clinical evidence for the heritable risk of IBD has been obtained from twin studies, which also suggest that genetic factors may be more important in CD than in ulcerative colitis (UC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. In a study that included 80 twins with IBD, for example, the concordance rate for monozygotic twins was markedly higher in CD than UC (50 versus 19 percent) and continued to rise over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>First-degree relatives of patients with IBD are approximately 3 to 20 times more likely to develop the disease than the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/9-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-14</a>]. While first-degree relatives of patients with CD have a greater increased risk of developing CD than UC, the risk of developing UC in these relatives is greater than the general population. Similarly, first-degree relatives of UC patients have a greater increased risk of developing UC than CD, and the risk of developing CD in these relatives is greater than the general population. In one report, children in whom both parents had IBD (CD or UC) had up to a 33 percent chance of developing IBD by age 28 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. All of the affected offspring developed CD and were born to parents who both had CD. In addition, having a sibling with CD can increase the risk of developing CD by 30 times compared with the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Approximately two-thirds of sibling pairs are diagnosed within ten years of each other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Having a positive family history of IBD remains the strongest risk factor for developing IBD.</p><p>Children of an affected parent who is Jewish may be at a higher risk of developing IBD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>Clinical features of the disease also demonstrate a heritable pattern. Concordance in the location (eg, ileal versus colonic) and type (eg, fibrostenotic, fistulas) of CD has been observed, as illustrated by the following findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/15-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 554 patients with CD, 17 percent had a family history of CD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Concordance of the site of disease in at least two family members was observed in 86 percent of cases, and 82 percent were concordant for the clinical type of disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another report evaluated 72 families with two to five or more affected first degree relatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Concordance for disease location and type were present in 56 and 49 percent in families with two affected members compared to 83 and 76 percent in families with more than two affected members.</p><p/><p>There is some support for &quot;genetic anticipation,&quot; which refers to the development of earlier onset and more severe disease in offspring of affected parents in subsequent generations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/14,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,21,22</a>]. In one study, for example, 48 of 57 children with CD born of parents with CD developed symptoms a median of 16 years earlier than the onset of disease in their parents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Rather than reflecting genetic anticipation, the preceding observations may in part be explained by ascertainment bias because children of parents with IBD may be subjected to earlier diagnostic evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/16,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,23</a>]. In addition, apparent genetic anticipation may be explained in part by bias secondary to the lack of adjustment for different observation times among subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Since children of affected parents are typically followed for a much shorter time span than their parents (up to a lower average age), the average age of disease onset in children may be lower than would be found if this group were followed for a longer time. However, this cannot be the entire explanation since the parents may be first diagnosed after the child (12 of 49 cases in one series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific genes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although genetic alteration in any one of several individual genes in mice is sufficient to lead to an IBD-like syndrome, in humans, alterations in more than 200 distinct loci confer a modest effect by themselves; it is likely that the aggregate effect at several loci contributes to the IBD phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>].</p><p>A variety of screening approaches, most notably genome-wide association studies (GWAS), have implicated over 200 distinct susceptibility loci for IBD, the majority associated with both CD and UC and over 70 percent associated with other immune-mediated diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, and celiac disease, as well as with mycobacterial infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/28-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-52</a>]. Similar studies in pediatric cohorts have identified many of the same genes associated with adult IBD risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/41,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,51</a>]. Deep resequencing of genes identified by GWAS in patient cohorts have further identified rare variants within these loci adding to the overall genetic variation associated with IBD risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Such gene identification strategies have pinpointed several critical signaling pathways that have been consistently associated with IBD susceptibility. Analysis of the functional properties of the proteins encoded by these various genes has further aided in identifying specific mechanistic pathways that are important in the pathogenesis of these disorders.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intracellular innate immune pathways recognizing microbial products in the cytoplasm</strong> &ndash; The IBD1 gene on chromosome 16 encodes the protein NOD2 (CARD15) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/32-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-38</a>]. Mutations in IBD1 confer susceptibility to ileal CD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. In a prospective cohort of 186 children, the prevalence of NOD2 mutations was 42 percent, suggesting that early onset CD has a strong genetic component [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The wild-type NOD2 protein activates nuclear factor kappa B in response to muramyl dipeptide, a fragment of bacterial peptidoglycan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]; this process is deficient in subjects with the mutant form of NOD2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

NOD2 can also regulate autophagy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>], suggesting that these pathways are integrated and defective in some patients with CD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pathways regulating adaptive immunity</strong> &ndash; Adaptive immune genes that regulate both the IL-17 and IL-23 receptor pathway have been implicated for IBD risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/43,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,48</a>] including genes associated with risk for both UC and CD (eg, IL23R, IL12B, STAT3, JAK2, TNFSF15, and TYK2). Some of these genes (IL-10, STAT3, JAK2, and TYK2) also play a role in the IL-10 immunoregulatory pathway that has also been independently linked to both UC and CD. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pathways regulating epithelial function</strong> &ndash; A number of epithelial barrier genes have been associated with IBD (more commonly associated with ulcerative colitis as compared with Crohn disease (eg, OCTN2, ECM1, CDH1, HNF4A, LAMB1, and GNA12) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/50,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,57</a>]. Genes that control Paneth cell biology and the ER <span class=\"nowrap\">stress/unfolded</span> protein response have also been identified in CD (eg, Xbp-1; NOD2, ATG16L1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>]. ATG16L1 and NOD2 have been associated with changes in Paneth cell morphology. Patients with CD with a higher proportion of abnormal Paneth cells (&gt;20 percent) had earlier disease recurrence following surgical resection compared with patients with lower proportion of abnormal Paneth cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Major histocompatibility complex</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have evaluated potential associations of IBD with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) loci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/44,61-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,61-76</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-leukocyte-antigens-hla-a-roadmap\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human leukocyte antigens (HLA): A roadmap&quot;</a>). Considered together, these studies have demonstrated that HLA-DR2 is associated with UC, particularly in Japanese patients, and extraintestinal manifestations of CD are more commonly observed in patients with HLA-A2, HLA-DR1, and DQw5. In a GWAS of a Japanese population, HLA-Cw*1202-B*5201-DRB1*1502 haplotype was associated with increased susceptibility to UC but decreased risk for CD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. The largest study examining the role of the HLA in European ancestry IBD implicated multiple HLA alleles with a primary role for HLA-DRB1*01:03. In addition, significant differences were noted at some alleles with opposite effects in UC and CD (eg, HLA-DRB1*07:01). Furthermore, the effect size in CD for both HLA-DRB1*01:03 and HLA-DRB1*07:01 depended on disease location.</p><p>The majority of advances in IBD genetics have been made in Northern European ancestry populations, but studies have been published in East Asian, Ashkenazi Jewish, and Puerto Rican populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/78-83\" class=\"abstract_t\">78-83</a>]. These studies have identified that some IBD genes are shared across populations (eg, TNFSF15, FCGR2A, HLA alleles), while others are peculiar to different ethnic groups. This is best understood by looking at genes associated with autophagy: NOD2 and ATG16L1 appear to have no role in CD in East Asians whereas ATG16L2, implicated in Korean CD, is not associated with CD in European populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,85</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3047856520\"><span class=\"h2\">Genotype-phenotype associations in IBD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genetic variation appears to influence disease location and prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-factors-in-inflammatory-bowel-disease/abstract/86,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">86,87</a>].

Clinical features of the CD also demonstrate a heritable pattern with concordance in disease location (eg, ileal versus colonic) and type (eg, fibrostenotic, fistulas). Furthermore, the presence of &quot;genetic anticipation,&quot; which refers to the development of earlier onset and more severe disease in offspring of affected parents in subsequent generations, also suggests a heritable cause for IBD. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Genetic factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have implicated over 200 distinct susceptibility loci for IBD. Rare variants within these loci have been identified adding to the overall genetic variation associated with IBD risk. The functional properties of the proteins encoded by these genes has aided in identifying specific mechanistic pathways that are important in the pathogenesis of IBD. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Specific genes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several studies have evaluated potential associations of IBD with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) loci. However, results among studies have varied. Some variation may be due to differences in methods used to assess MHC and in population groups studied. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Major histocompatibility complex'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several genetic syndromes have been associated with IBD. These include Turners syndrome, Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, and glycogen storage disease type 1b.
