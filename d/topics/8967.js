These findings led to the development of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) as the treatment for patients with advanced prostate cancer. Although ADT is palliative, it can normalize serum levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in over 90 percent of patients and can produce objective tumor responses in 80 to 90 percent. This antitumor activity can improve quality of life by reducing bone pain as well as the rates of complications (eg, pathologic fracture, spinal cord compression, ureteral obstruction).</p><p>The duration of response to ADT for patients with metastatic disease is highly variable, and most prostate cancer patients eventually experience disease progression despite treatment. Patients who have progressed while on ADT are said to have castration-resistant disease, although such tumors may remain responsive to additional therapies directed against androgenic stimulation of the prostate cancer.</p><p>ADT was initially used as monotherapy for the treatment of advanced or metastatic prostate cancer. The development of additional effective therapies has led to their use in combination with ADT:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=abiraterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Abiraterone</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a></span> plus ADT &ndash; Abiraterone acts by blocking the intracellular conversion of androgen precursors in the testes, adrenal glands, and prostate tumor tissue. It has been shown to prolong overall survival in castration-resistant disease. More recently, randomized trials have shown that combining ADT with abiraterone plus prednisone in patients with very high-risk localized or metastatic castration-sensitive disease prolongs overall survival compared with ADT alone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=castration-resistant-prostate-cancer-treatments-targeting-the-androgen-pathway\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Castration-resistant prostate cancer: Treatments targeting the androgen pathway&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H9494784\" class=\"local\">'Combined modality approaches incorporating ADT'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=docetaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Docetaxel</a> plus ADT &ndash; Docetaxel prolongs survival in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer.

(See <a href=\"#H3076766287\" class=\"local\">'ADT plus docetaxel'</a> below.) </p><p>ADT can be accomplished either by surgical orchiectomy (castration) or medical orchiectomy (using either a gonadotropin-releasing hormone [GnRH] agonist or a GnRH antagonist). Both medical orchiectomy and surgical orchiectomy are appropriate methods for lowering serum testosterone levels in men with advanced castration-sensitive prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-systemic-therapy-for-castration-sensitive-prostate-cancer/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].

Estrogens inhibit the release of GnRH from the hypothalamus, thus suppressing pituitary luteinizing hormone (LH) release and thereby reducing testicular production of testosterone. Diethylstilbestrol (DES) was extensively studied as an alternative to surgical orchiectomy for the initial management of metastatic prostate cancer prior to the development of GnRH agonists. However, two large randomized trials conducted by the Veterans Administration Cooperative Urological Research Group (VACURG) found that DES at a dose of 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> significantly increased the risk of dying from heart disease or stroke and that DES did not provide any advantage compared with surgical orchiectomy in terms of overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-systemic-therapy-for-castration-sensitive-prostate-cancer/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>Guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), and the European Association of Urology (EAU) recommend ADT using either medical orchiectomy or surgical orchiectomy as the initial hormonal therapy for men with advanced prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-systemic-therapy-for-castration-sensitive-prostate-cancer/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. The decision between medical and surgical treatment is based upon a variety of factors, including patient preference, cost, and treatment availability.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1178848124\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy of initial ADT monotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The efficacy of ADT as the initial therapy for metastatic prostate cancer in the contemporary era, where patient management includes established secondary agents (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docetaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docetaxel</a>), is illustrated by the control arm of the STAMPEDE trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-systemic-therapy-for-castration-sensitive-prostate-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In that ongoing trial, which began in 2005, over 8000 men are being randomly assigned to ADT (medical or surgical orchiectomy) or one of a number of experimental arms as their initial systemic therapy. An analysis included data from 917 men with metastatic disease (including 88 percent with bone alone or bone plus soft tissue disease) managed with ADT alone with a median follow-up of 20 months. The median failure-free survival duration following ADT was 20 months, while the median overall survival was 42 months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical orchiectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bilateral orchiectomy is a relatively simple, cost-effective procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-systemic-therapy-for-castration-sensitive-prostate-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Following surgery, serum testosterone levels rapidly decrease to castrate levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-systemic-therapy-for-castration-sensitive-prostate-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], and this is usually associated with improvements in bone pain and other disease-related symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-systemic-therapy-for-castration-sensitive-prostate-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Although orchiectomy is used much less frequently than medical castration in North America and Europe, it remains a useful alternative when an immediate decrease in testosterone is necessary (eg, impending spinal cord compression) or when costs or adherence to medical therapy are an issue. In many countries, bilateral orchiectomy remains the standard of care for initial hormone therapy of metastatic prostate cancer.</p><p>The psychological impact of surgical castration is also an important factor for men choosing between surgery and medical treatment. In a study of 159 men with metastatic prostate cancer who were provided with standard information regarding the costs, benefits, and risks of orchiectomy, only 22 percent chose orchiectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-systemic-therapy-for-castration-sensitive-prostate-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, the benefits of lower overall cost, avoidance of injections for continued medical castration, and potentially fewer clinic visits may make orchiectomy more appealing in the current era of escalating health care costs. </p><p>The psychological effects of orchiectomy may be ameliorated with placement of testicular prostheses or with modification of the total orchiectomy to a subcapsular orchiectomy, in which the tunica albuginea and epididymis remain intact, providing a cosmetic effect in the scrotum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-systemic-therapy-for-castration-sensitive-prostate-cancer/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical orchiectomy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H261285669\"><span class=\"h3\">Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medical castration using a GnRH agonist was first reported in 1982 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-systemic-therapy-for-castration-sensitive-prostate-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h4\">Mechanism of action</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Synthetic GnRH analogs have greater receptor affinity, have reduced susceptibility to enzymatic degradation, and are approximately 100-fold more potent than the natural GnRH molecule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-systemic-therapy-for-castration-sensitive-prostate-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. GnRH agonists bind to the GnRH receptors on pituitary gonadotropin-producing cells, causing an initial release of both LH and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which causes a subsequent increase in testosterone production from testicular Leydig cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F50484\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50484 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>This transient rise in LH when GnRH therapy is initiated can cause a surge in serum testosterone, which may stimulate prostate cancer growth. This &quot;flare&quot; may cause an increase in bone pain, bladder obstruction, or other symptoms due to prostate cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-systemic-therapy-for-castration-sensitive-prostate-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Thus, initial treatment with GnRH alone is contraindicated in men with severe urinary tract obstruction or painful bone metastases. The flare phenomenon can be effectively prevented with antiandrogen therapy, which blocks the effect of the increased serum testosterone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-systemic-therapy-for-castration-sensitive-prostate-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1510492524\" class=\"local\">'ADT plus first-generation antiandrogens'</a> below.)</p><p>After approximately one week of therapy, GnRH receptors are downregulated on the gonadotropin-producing cells, with a decline in the pituitary production of LH and FSH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-systemic-therapy-for-castration-sensitive-prostate-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The fall in serum LH leads to a decrease in serum testosterone to castrate levels within three to four weeks after the start of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-systemic-therapy-for-castration-sensitive-prostate-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Continued treatment maintains serum testosterone at castrate levels.</p><p>The decrease in testosterone production is generally reversible upon cessation of GnRH agonist therapy. However, testosterone production does not always return to baseline levels and may be related to the duration of GnRH agonist therapy, patient age, and other factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-systemic-therapy-for-castration-sensitive-prostate-cancer/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h4\">Formulations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>GnRH agonists approved for parenteral administration include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leuprolide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leuprolide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=goserelin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">goserelin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triptorelin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triptorelin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buserelin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buserelin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=histrelin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">histrelin</a>. Buserelin is available in both a parenteral and nasal formulation. Depot formulations are widely used.

Historically, this has correlated with a level of 1.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L</span> (&lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL),</span> although contemporary laboratory testing indicates that testosterone levels decline to 0.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L</span> (&lt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL)</span> after orchiectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-systemic-therapy-for-castration-sensitive-prostate-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The potential relationship between suppression of serum testosterone and clinical outcome is illustrated by a secondary analysis of the JPR.7 trial, in which 626 evaluable men were treated with continuous ADT for a rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and were followed for a median of eight years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-systemic-therapy-for-castration-sensitive-prostate-cancer/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. The risk of dying was lowest in those with the greatest suppression of serum testosterone in the first year. Compared with a first-year minimum testosterone nadir &lt;0.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L,</span> those with a nadir testosterone of 0.7 to 1.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L</span> had an increased risk of dying (hazard ratio [HR] 2.08, 95% CI 1.28-3.38), as did those with a nadir &gt;1.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L</span> (HR 2.93, 95% CI 0.77-4.70). However, it is unclear whether further hormonal manipulation to achieve a deeper suppression of serum testosterone would result in improved outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-systemic-therapy-for-castration-sensitive-prostate-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Our practice is consistent with the current guidelines from the NCCN, which use a serum testosterone level of 1.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L</span> (&lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL)</span>. Additional hormonal maneuvers can be considered if this level of suppression of serum testosterone cannot be achieved with initial treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-systemic-therapy-for-castration-sensitive-prostate-cancer/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Rechecking the serum testosterone level is especially important if the anticipated clinical or biochemical response to treatment has not been achieved. Some patients have serum testosterone levels &gt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> even when rechecked. For those patients, serum testosterone level should be repeated using mass spectroscopy because testosterone levels done by radioimmunoassay may crossreact with closely related androgens.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h4\">GnRH agonists versus orchiectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unlike orchiectomy, medical castration with GnRH agonists offers the potential to reverse hypogonadal symptoms upon cessation of therapy. In addition, GnRH agonists avoid the psychological issues associated with surgical castration.</p><p>A meta-analysis of 10 trials involving 1908 patients comparing a GnRH agonist with orchiectomy found equivalence in overall survival, progression-related outcomes, and time to treatment failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-systemic-therapy-for-castration-sensitive-prostate-cancer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. At two years, survival with a GnRH agonist was not statistically worse (HR for death 1.13, 95% CI 0.92-1.39, compared with orchiectomy). In this meta-analysis, there were no significant differences in efficacy between <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leuprolide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leuprolide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=goserelin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">goserelin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buserelin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buserelin</a>.</p><p>GnRH agonists are frequently used with antiandrogens to produce a combined androgen blockade during the initial period of treatment to prevent a disease flare; they also may be used in conjunction with antiandrogens for long-term therapy. (See <a href=\"#H1510492524\" class=\"local\">'ADT plus first-generation antiandrogens'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H261287591\"><span class=\"h4\">Intermittent androgen deprivation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intermittent androgen deprivation (IAD) attempts to minimize the adverse effects of medical castration by withdrawing treatment in patients who have responded to ADT and then reinstituting ADT when there is evidence of recurrent or progressive disease.</p><p>The biological rationale is twofold. First, prolonged ADT theoretically may facilitate progression from androgen dependence to androgen independence. In addition, many of the acute and chronic side effects of ADT are due to castrate levels of testosterone. Periods of time when men are off therapy may be associated with decreases in these side effects, thereby improving quality of life.</p><p>IAD typically involves treatment for either a fixed interval of time or until a maximal response is achieved based upon serum PSA levels. ADT is then withdrawn, and patients are followed for evidence of recurrence. As testosterone production resumes, the side effects of ADT are mitigated, but the risk of disease progression also increases. The patient is followed with PSA measurements, and ADT is reinitiated based on a predefined threshold level of serum PSA (which varies with different practices but is often between 10 and 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> or with evidence of new metastatic disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H261289169\"><span class=\"h5\">Metastatic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Intergroup trial INT 0162 (S9346, <a href=\"http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00002651?term=NCT00002651&rank=1&amp;token=NK91I08KOJ1eJ1hT1o/oHgJu4vbbEBRl2V0d48fIIMBWAERS57Gau+ubFkr8kNqg/8luoxTipShSTUhX9Cqv40sTyRb+BqjtTmw9F0HfBLs=&amp;TOPIC_ID=6951\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NCT00002651</a>) compared IAD with continuous ADT for its impact on overall survival and quality of life in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer and a serum PSA &ge;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-systemic-therapy-for-castration-sensitive-prostate-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Patients assigned to IAD remained off therapy until they met a prespecified criterion (serum PSA either &ge;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> or back to original baseline), at which point ADT was resumed. Patients who responded to resumption of ADT could be managed with additional cycles off therapy.</p><p>Of the 3040 patients who were enrolled, 1749 patients were randomized and 1535 patients were available for analysis at a median follow-up of 9.8 years:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>INT 0162 was designed as a noninferiority trial based upon overall survival.
