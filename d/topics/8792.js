However, concern regarding transmission of blood-borne pathogens and efforts at cost containment caused a re-examination of transfusion practices in the 1980s. The 1988 National Institutes of Health Consensus Conference on Perioperative Red Blood Cell Transfusions suggested that no single criterion should be used as an indication for red cell component therapy, and that multiple factors related to the patient's clinical status and oxygen delivery needs should be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. During the subsequent 30 years, a large body of clinical evidence was generated, resulting in the publication of many guidelines for RBC transfusion in different settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult/abstract/3-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-17</a>]. A common theme of these guidelines is the need to balance the benefit of treating anemia with the desire to avoid unnecessary transfusion, with its associated costs and potential harms. This requires considerable diagnostic skill and acumen on the part of physicians ordering transfusions.</p><p>As blood transfusion practices are evaluated in randomized trials, we are increasingly able to emphasize clinical trial data, since these data provide the best evidence to guide transfusion decisions.</p><p>The indications and thresholds for RBC transfusion in adults will be reviewed here.

Thus, anemia has the potential to reduce oxygen delivery. However, most patients are able to increase tissue oxygen delivery by increasing cardiac output over a range of hemoglobin concentrations. The major physiologic considerations relevant to anemic patients are the degree to which oxygen delivery to the tissues is adequate and whether compensatory mechanisms for maintaining oxygen delivery will become overwhelmed or deleterious [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxygen-delivery-and-consumption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oxygen delivery and consumption&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Oxygen delivery (DO<sub>2</sub>) is determined by the formula:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">DO<sub>2</sub> &#160;= &#160;cardiac output &#160;x &#160;arterial oxygen content</p></div></div><p/><p>In healthy patients, DO<sub>2</sub> can be raised by increasing cardiac output (increased heart rate in conscious patients and increased stroke volume in anesthetized patients). In critically ill patients, DO<sub>2</sub> may become more dependent on arterial oxygen content, and oxygen utilization may become pathologically dependent upon DO<sub>2</sub>. This pathologic dependence may be due to elevated arterial lactate concentrations and a change in the slope of the oxygen extraction ratio. Determining what hemoglobin level is adequate in individual clinical scenarios has been the goal of a large number of clinical studies and randomized trials. (See <a href=\"#H606388\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic hospitalized patient'</a> below.)</p><p>At rest, there is a large reserve in oxygen delivery, since the rate of delivery normally exceeds consumption by a factor of four. Thus, if intravascular volume is maintained during bleeding and cardiovascular status is not impaired, oxygen delivery theoretically will be adequate until the hematocrit falls below 10 percent because greater cardiac output, rightward shift of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve, and increased oxygen extraction can compensate for the decrease in arterial oxygen content (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68984\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68984 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>These predictions were confirmed in a study in which healthy resting individuals underwent acute isovolemic reduction of their hemoglobin to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (equivalent to a hematocrit of approximately 15 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Though some individuals did develop electrocardiogram (ECG) changes consistent with myocardial ischemia, there was little evidence of inadequate oxygen delivery, and the fall in hemoglobin was associated with progressive increases in stroke volume and heart rate (and therefore cardiac output), and a progressive reduction in the systemic vascular resistance. Heart rate was found to increase linearly in response to the acute isovolemic anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Of note, cognitive function measured by reaction time and immediate memory was impaired when the hemoglobin concentration was reduced to 5 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>The oxygen-carrying capacity of blood does not directly reflect the delivery of oxygen to tissues. Although techniques to measure tissue oxygenation are under development, they are not yet ready for clinical use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>The preceding considerations represent the optimal clinical response in healthy adults. However, blood transfusion is usually administered to patients who are ill with underlying comorbidities, and there is concern that compensatory mechanisms may be impaired in critically ill patients, particularly in patients with underlying cardiovascular disease. It has been argued in the past that this might justify prophylactic transfusion to maintain a hemoglobin of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>. However, data in favor of this hemoglobin target level are lacking. To the contrary, multicenter randomized controlled trials indicate that compared with a target hemoglobin of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> target hemoglobin values of 7 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> are associated with equivalent or better outcomes in most patient populations.

The adjusted odds of death or cardiac events correlated inversely with the preoperative hematocrit.

The final decision to transfuse should incorporate the clinical status, co-morbidity, and the individual wishes of the patient. The hemoglobin level chosen is based on the results from clinical trials, but clinical judgment is required. It is also important to recognize that lower hemoglobin thresholds have not been tested in most clinical settings and may be tolerated by many patients. This approach is most consistent with the AABB Guidelines, which we coauthored [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3996125012\" class=\"local\">'Society guidelines'</a> below.)</p><p>For most patients, we prefer using a restrictive transfusion strategy (ie, giving less blood; transfusing at a lower hemoglobin level; and aiming for a lower target hemoglobin level) rather than a liberal transfusion strategy (ie, giving more blood; transfusing at a higher hemoglobin level). For most hemodynamically stable medical and surgical patients, we suggest considering transfusion at a hemoglobin of 7 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> with the threshold based on the value established as safe in the clinical trial with the population that most closely resembles the patient. Some patients may tolerate a lower hemoglobin level (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F93934\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93934 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Assessment of the post-transfusion hemoglobin level can be performed as early as 15 minutes following transfusion, as long as the patient is not actively bleeding. This practice is based on studies showing a high degree of concordance between values measured 15 minutes after completion of the transfusion versus longer intervals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p>Major exceptions to the use of a threshold of 7 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> where evidence is insufficient to guide therapy, include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic patients may be transfused at higher hemoglobin levels to treat symptoms.

This view is based on our recognition that different patient populations may have different clinical features that could potentially affect transfusion outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. As an example, a hemoglobin threshold of 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> may be safer for patients with gastrointestinal bleeding because it reduces portal pressure and decreases the chance of rebleeding, whereas a threshold of 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> for patients with pre-existing coronary disease may provide better oxygen delivery to a vulnerable myocardium. Similarly, the distinction between using a threshold of 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> for hemodynamically stable patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) and 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> for hemodynamically stable medical and surgical patients is based solely on the values used in randomized trials; we do not know if these two populations (ICU and <span class=\"nowrap\">medical/surgical)</span> are biologically distinct and truly have different Hbg requirements.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3996125012\"><span class=\"h2\">Society guidelines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since 2012, transfusion guidelines have been published by the following societies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AABB (formerly the American Association of Blood Banks), 2016 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>United Kingdom National Clinical Guideline Centre, 2016 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>American Society of Anesthesiologists (perioperative blood management), 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>British Committee for Standards in Haematology, 2014 (myelodysplastic syndromes [MDS] management) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>National Comprehensive Cancer Network (chemotherapy-induced anemia), 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>American College of Physicians (anemia in heart disease), 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines Committee including the pediatric subgroup (sepsis and shock), 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>British Committee for Standards in Haematology (critically ill adults), 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient Blood Management Guidelines: Modules 1-4.

As an example, the 2016 AABB guidelines (which we co-authored) include the following recommendations for hemodynamically stable patients without active bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemoglobin &lt;6 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> &ndash; Transfusion recommended except in exceptional circumstances.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemoglobin 6 to 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> &ndash; Transfusion generally likely to be indicated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemoglobin 7 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> &ndash; Transfusion may be appropriate in patients undergoing orthopedic surgery or cardiac surgery, and in those with stable cardiovascular disease, after evaluating the patient&rsquo;s clinical status.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemoglobin 8 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> &ndash; Transfusion generally not indicated, but should be considered for some populations (eg, those with symptomatic anemia, ongoing bleeding, acute coronary syndrome with ischemia, and <span class=\"nowrap\">hematology/oncology</span> patients with severe thrombocytopenia who are at risk of bleeding).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemoglobin &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> &ndash; Transfusion generally not indicated except in exceptional circumstances.</p><p/><p>The guidelines also emphasize that the decision to transfuse should not be based only on hemoglobin level but should incorporate individual patient characteristics and symptoms. Clinical judgment is critical in the decision to transfuse; therefore, transfusing RBCs above or below the specified hemoglobin threshold may be dictated by the clinical context. Similarly, the decision not to transfuse RBCs to a patient with a hemoglobin concentration below the recommended thresholds is also a matter of clinical judgment.</p><p>A brief comparison of recommendations from 10 clinical guidelines published between 2012 and 2017 is available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1164127050\"><span class=\"h1\">THRESHOLDS FOR SPECIFIC PATIENT POPULATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H606380\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptomatic patient</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some randomized trials of transfusion thresholds, symptoms of anemia were an indication for transfusion regardless of whether the hemoglobin was above the prescribed threshold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. We agree with the premise that symptomatic anemia should be treated with transfusion in patients with hemoglobin &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> regardless of the hemoglobin level, provided that the symptoms are severe enough and are clearly related to the anemia rather than the underlying condition. It is reasonable to defer transfusion for some symptomatic individuals with a hemoglobin between 7 and 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL;</span> an example would be a young person without comorbidities or coronary artery disease whose hemoglobin is 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> is not expected to decline further, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> is expected to increase their hemoglobin within one or two weeks.</p><p>Symptoms of anemia may include symptoms of myocardial ischemia, orthostatic hypotension or tachycardia unresponsive to fluid replacement, or marked dyspnea at rest. It is important to note, however, that these symptoms can also be caused by other conditions (eg, massive pulmonary embolus). While exertional symptoms can be helpful in alerting the clinician to the presence of anemia, they are generally not considered indications for red cell transfusion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-anemia#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with anemia&quot;, section on 'Signs and symptoms of anemia'</a>.)</p><p>Chronic anemia can present with symptoms such as irritability, weakness, and exercise intolerance. These symptoms of anemia are nonspecific and often not considered sufficient indications for transfusion. Decisions on whether to transfuse RBCs to treat fatigue are covered separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-anemia#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with anemia&quot;, section on 'Signs and symptoms of anemia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-and-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Some patients will not manifest typical anemia symptoms for a variety of reasons (eg, altered mental status, diabetic neuropathy, analgesic therapy). Thus, surrogate measures (eg, ECG changes) may be useful in some situations. When transfusion is used in a symptomatic patient, it is important to determine whether symptoms have improved following the transfusion, because this may guide further decision-making. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-adults-storage-specialized-modifications-and-infusion-parameters\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusion in adults: Storage, specialized modifications, and infusion parameters&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H812290\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute coronary syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal transfusion threshold in the setting of acute coronary syndromes (ACS; ie, acute myocardial infarction [MI], unstable angina) remains unresolved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. Our practice in patients with ACS is to transfuse when hemoglobin is &lt;8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> and to consider transfusion when the hemoglobin is between 8 and 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>. If the patient has ongoing ischemia or other symptoms, we maintain the hemoglobin &ge;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>. In a stable, asymptomatic patient (eg, one whose symptoms have resolved after treatment with medical or interventional therapy), it is unknown when to transfuse, although we tend to maintain a higher hemoglobin level using clinical judgment based on evaluating the patient's symptoms and underlying condition.</p><p>Our opinion is based on a lack of clinical trial data that support a lower threshold, and a suggestion from a pilot trial of 110 patients with ACS that a threshold of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> is safer in patients with ACS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. This trial found that compared with transfusion for a hemoglobin &lt;8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (restrictive strategy), transfusion to raise the hemoglobin &ge;10 (liberal strategy) was associated with greater survival at 30 days (98 versus 87 percent). Other experts, including other authors for UpToDate, prefer to give transfusions only when the hemoglobin is at a slightly lower threshold than is used for some patients in our practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

Some patients will remain asymptomatic from anemia at lower hemoglobin levels; conversely transfusion at higher hemoglobin levels is often appropriate for symptomatic patients and in the setting of an ACS. In addition, threshold-based transfusion may not be appropriate for patients requiring massive transfusion. Discussions surrounding specific clinical scenarios are presented separately.
