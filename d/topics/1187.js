We reserve additional testing with other serological studies, for example, antisynthetase antibodies (eg, Jo-1), creatine kinase and aldolase, Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s antibodies (SS-A, SS-B), scleroderma antibodies (anti-topoisomerase [Scl-70]), and overlap antibodies (PM-1, also known as PM-Scl), for patients with a clinical suspicion of rheumatic disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F105280\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105280 \">table 4</a>).

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-phase-reactants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute phase reactants&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) levels are generally not helpful in the initial evaluation of ILD, because of the low sensitivity and specificity of the test for sarcoidosis.

In one report, the receiver operating characteristics of these four markers were evaluated in a mixed population of patients with idiopathic ILD, collagen vascular disease-associated ILD, and controls with and without pulmonary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-interstitial-lung-disease-diagnostic-testing/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. KL-6 was associated with the highest sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy for the presence of ILD (94, 96, and 94 percent, respectively). The clinical role of these serum markers in the diagnosis of ILD is unclear and these tests are generally not commercially available. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the future, the KL-6 assay may help to identify and monitor ILD in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other rheumatic diseases.

Although the chest radiograph is useful in suggesting the presence of interstitial lung disease (ILD), the correlation between the radiographic pattern and the stage of disease (clinical or histopathologic) is generally poor. Only the radiographic finding of honeycombing (small cystic spaces) correlates with pathologic findings and, when present, portends a poor prognosis.</p><p>In the evaluation of ILD, it is important to review all previous chest films to assess the rate of change in disease activity.</p><p>The chest radiograph is normal in as many as 10 percent of patients with some forms of ILD, particularly those with hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Thus, a complete evaluation should be undertaken even if a symptomatic patient has a normal chest radiograph or an asymptomatic patient has radiographic evidence of ILD. Failure to adequately evaluate such individuals may lead to disease progression that is irreversible by the time the patient seeks additional medical attention. The radiologic patterns and disease distributions associated with specific ILDs are discussed separately.

We typically obtain both supine and prone images to avoid confusing dependent atelectasis with interstitial opacities. Comparing inspiratory and expiratory views is helpful when bronchiolitis is suspected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-resolution-computed-tomography-of-the-lungs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High resolution computed tomography of the lungs&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchiolitis-in-adults#H3936193\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bronchiolitis in adults&quot;, section on 'Chest imaging'</a>.)</p><p>HRCT provides greater diagnostic accuracy than the plain chest radiograph, but several series have reported inconsistency among observers in the accuracy of differentiating between the ILDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-interstitial-lung-disease-diagnostic-testing/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. In addition, it is difficult to extrapolate from the diagnostic accuracy in carefully controlled series to that in routine clinical practice because of variability in radiologic experience and scanning protocols.</p><p>Nonetheless, certain HRCT findings help to narrow the differential diagnosis of ILD. The correlations between the various HRCT patterns and likely diagnoses are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F51094%7EPULM%2F64841\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51094 graphicRef64841 \">table 6A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-interstitial-lung-disease-diagnostic-testing/abstract/8,17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,17-20</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-resolution-computed-tomography-of-the-lungs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High resolution computed tomography of the lungs&quot;</a>).

An electrocardiogram is typically obtained to evaluate for evidence of pulmonary hypertension or concurrent cardiac disease.

A reasonable approach is to perform echocardiography in patients with an abnormal electrocardiogram, suspected heart failure, rapid onset of radiographic findings, or a moderate to severe reduction in diffusing capacity (DLCO). A low DLCO may suggest concomitant pulmonary hypertension. The presence of an abnormal heart rate recovery one minute after a 6MWT has also been associated with an increased likelihood of underlying pulmonary hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-interstitial-lung-disease-diagnostic-testing/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

Doppler echocardiography has been shown to have a sensitivity as high as 88 percent for the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension, but the correlation between Doppler echocardiogram-derived pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) and right heart catheterization-derived PASP is lower in right-heart predominant disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-interstitial-lung-disease-diagnostic-testing/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].
