Late puberty is when a child starts puberty much later than normal. The body changes in late puberty are the same as those in normal puberty. They just happen when a child is older.</p><p>Puberty usually starts between ages 9 to 12 in girls and ages 10 to 13 in boys. With late puberty:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A girl hasn't shown any signs of puberty by age 12. Usually, the first sign of puberty in girls is that the breasts grow bigger.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A boy hasn't shown any signs of puberty by age 14. Usually, the first sign of puberty in boys is that the testicles get bigger (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F68075\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68075 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11142946\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes late puberty?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Puberty is caused by hormones in the body. The brain makes hormones that start puberty. These hormones travel to the testicles (in boys), and the ovaries (in girls) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F68075\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68075 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80271\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80271 \">figure 2</a>). The brain hormones signal the testicles to make a hormone called &quot;testosterone.&quot; They signal the ovaries to make a hormone called &quot;estrogen.&quot; Estrogen and testosterone cause the changes in the body.</p><p>Late puberty can happen if this process doesn't happen on time. But it doesn't mean your child has a medical problem. Some children start puberty late because:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They are growing more slowly than other children. This can be normal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Late puberty runs in their family. If a parent went through puberty late, chances are good that their child will, too. This is especially true for boys.</p><p/><p>Other children start puberty late because of a medical problem or condition. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An abnormal growth or other problem in the brain, ovaries, or testicles</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A long-term illness or condition</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems caused by abnormal genes that babies can be born with</p><p/><p>Children (especially girls) can also start puberty late if they are too thin, don't eat enough, or exercise much more than normal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11142961\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my child need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your child isn't showing any signs of puberty, the doctor or nurse will want to know why. He or she will talk with you and your child, and do an exam. He or she will also probably do:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>X-rays of one of your child's hands and wrists &ndash; These X-rays can show how fast your child is growing.</p><p/><p>Depending on these results, the doctor might do other tests. These can include more blood tests or a CT scan, ultrasound, or other imaging test of your child's brain or belly. Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p>The doctor or nurse will also do repeat exams over time to follow your child's growth and development.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11142976\"><span class=\"h1\">How is late puberty treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on your child's age and the cause of the late puberty.</p><p>If puberty is late because of a medical problem, the doctor will treat the problem (if it can be treated). Different treatments might include medicines (such as hormones) or surgery. After treatment, your child will most likely start puberty.</p><p>If your child is normal but growing slowly, or if late puberty runs in his or her family, treatment usually involves &quot;watching and waiting&quot; for puberty to start on its own.</p><p>If your child is underweight or exercises too much, the doctor can give you advice about how to help your child get to a healthy weight and have a healthy lifestyle.</p><p>Some children (mostly boys) who are normal but growing slowly are treated with hormone treatment to help start puberty. Doctors usually recommend this treatment only if late puberty is having a big impact on the child's life.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11142991\"><span class=\"h1\">What else can I do to help my child?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can help your child feel good about him or herself. Point out your child's strengths instead of focusing on his or her body. Some children who start puberty late can have a hard time fitting in, because they look younger than other children their age.</p><p>If your child is teased or treated badly, talk to the doctor or nurse about ways to get help.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11143006\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-sexual-development-puberty-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Normal sexual development (puberty) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=teen-sexuality-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Teen sexuality (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acne-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Acne (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=my-child-is-short-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: My child is short (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
