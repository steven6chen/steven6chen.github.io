The opportunity for early intervention is often missed, and may result in complications, such as anal fissure, stool withholding, and fecal incontinence (also known as encopresis). The prevention of constipation focuses on timely anticipatory guidance regarding diet, toilet training, and toileting behaviors. The treatment of constipation depends upon the age of the child and the duration of symptoms. It may involve education, dietary changes, behavior changes, and pharmacotherapy, alone or in combination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-acute-constipation-in-infants-and-children/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The prevention and treatment of acute constipation will be discussed here. The definition, etiology, and diagnosis of constipation are presented separately, as is the treatment of chronic constipation and fecal incontinence.

Some children may have rectal impaction and overflow fecal incontinence, which typically develops because they have learned to withhold stool, usually to avoid pain during bowel movements. </p><p>These symptoms are described as &quot;acute&quot; constipation if they have been present for less than four weeks. Symptoms of longer duration are classified as &quot;chronic&quot; functional constipation if they cannot be fully explained by another condition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57882\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57882 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-acute-constipation-in-infants-and-children/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].

There are certain times during a young child's life when constipation is likely to occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-acute-constipation-in-infants-and-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. If parents are given appropriate and timely education, these episodes may be anticipated and prevented, or if not prevented, quickly treated with temporary interventions. Complaints of simple constipation should not be ignored. Painful bowel movements can lead to withholding of stool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-acute-constipation-in-infants-and-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], worsening constipation, and eventual fecal impaction and fecal incontinence, often without parental awareness of a problem. The pathogenesis of constipation is discussed in detail separately, but mentioned briefly here since it is relevant to the provision of anticipatory guidance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis#H703999406\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional constipation in infants and children: Clinical features and differential diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a>.) </p><p>Times when constipation is likely to occur include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-acute-constipation-in-infants-and-children/abstract/5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The introduction of solid foods or cow's milk</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Toilet training</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>School entry</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Transition to solid diet</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The transition to a solid diet during infancy is a common trigger for constipation. This is because the transitional diet often includes inadequate amounts of fiber and fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-acute-constipation-in-infants-and-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Ensuring adequate fiber and fluid intake may be helpful in preventing constipation or in treating mild episodic constipation. By contrast, there is little evidence that adding liquid or fiber to the diet is effective in treating severe chronic constipation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic functional constipation and fecal incontinence in infants and children: Treatment&quot;</a>.) </p><p>For infants and children younger than two years, a reasonable goal for fiber intake is about 5 grams per day. This can be accomplished by providing several servings daily of pureed vegetables, fruits, and a fiber-containing infant cereal. Most vegetables and fruits supply approximately 1 gram of fiber per serving, but prunes and peas can supply up to 2 grams. Rice infant cereal supplies a negligible amount of fiber, whereas whole wheat, barley, and multigrain cereals supply 1 to 2 grams per serving [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-acute-constipation-in-infants-and-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dietary-recommendations-for-toddlers-preschool-and-school-age-children#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dietary recommendations for toddlers, preschool, and school-age children&quot;, section on 'Fiber'</a>.) </p><p>There is no need to increase fluid intake beyond maintenance requirements, unless there is evidence that the child is dehydrated. However, it is reasonable to ensure that maintenance fluid requirements are met. The minimum daily fluid intake depends upon the child's weight and ranges from 16 fluid ounces (500 mL) for a 5 kg infant, 32 ounces (960 mL) for a 10 kg child, to 42 ounces (1260 mL) for a 15 kg child, to 50 ounces (1500 mL) for a 20 kg child. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintenance-fluid-therapy-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintenance fluid therapy in children&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Transitioning from breast milk or formula to cow's milk also appears to trigger constipation in some individuals, although this association has not been established. If the development of constipation is temporally associated with transition to cow's milk, it is reasonable to do a trial of limiting cow's milk to 24 fluid ounces daily (475 to 700 mL), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a trial of a calcium-fortified soy milk or transition formula. The diet of these children should also be reviewed to ensure that they are receiving adequate amounts of fiber. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis#H704000133\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional constipation in infants and children: Clinical features and differential diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Cow's milk intolerance'</a>.)</p><p>Constipation also may develop because of anal fissures, which cause the infant to withhold stool (avoid defecation) because of pain. Anal fissures may develop because of vigorous wiping of the anus during diaper changes, or because of passing hard or large stool.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Toilet training</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children of toilet training age are susceptible to constipation for a variety of reasons: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stool withholding &ndash; Toilet training may trigger constipation because toddlers may not respond to the need to defecate, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> because children using adult-sized toilets without foot-support may not have sufficient leverage to successfully evacuate their stools. If stool passage is painful, toddlers may begin to withhold stool, which compounds the problem and leads to a vicious cycle of withholding, which leads to larger and harder stools, and more pain upon defecation. Once the withholding cycle has started, it can only be reversed by making the stools soft and passage of stools pain-free. Preventive measures include increasing fiber and decreasing milk intake, as described below, delaying toilet training until the child shows signs of readiness, and using a relaxed, &quot;child-oriented&quot; approach to toileting. If children show signs of stool withholding, it is often necessary to use short-term dietary interventions or laxatives, and sometimes to hold off on toilet training efforts. Anal fissures should be identified and treated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toilet-training\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toilet training&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Toddlers and children'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inadequate fiber &ndash; For prevention of constipation, we suggest a goal for fiber intake equal to the child's age plus 5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">grams/day,</span> as recommended by a consensus conference on dietary fiber in childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-acute-constipation-in-infants-and-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This translates to between 7 and 15 grams of fiber daily for children two to five years of age. Giving more than this fiber goal has no proven benefit for management of constipation in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-acute-constipation-in-infants-and-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommends a somewhat higher goal for fiber intake: 14 <span class=\"nowrap\">grams/1000</span> kcals in the diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-acute-constipation-in-infants-and-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], which translates to about 15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">grams/day</span> in toddlers and young children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dietary-recommendations-for-toddlers-preschool-and-school-age-children#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dietary recommendations for toddlers, preschool, and school-age children&quot;, section on 'Fiber'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Of note, consumption of excessive amounts of fiber can increase the risk of fecal impaction in children with stool withholding behaviors. Therefore, for children with stool withholding or a history of fecal impaction, extra fiber intake should be encouraged only after colorectal tone has been restored, eg, after several months of successful treatment with laxatives. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-functional-constipation-and-fecal-incontinence-in-infants-and-children-treatment#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic functional constipation and fecal incontinence in infants and children: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Fiber'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive cow's milk &ndash; The excessive consumption of whole cow's milk (&gt;32 fluid ounces [960 mL] per day) can slow intestinal motility and satiate the child, thereby diminishing the intake of other fluids and foods that promote soft stools, such as water, fruits, and vegetables [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-acute-constipation-in-infants-and-children/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Milk intake of 24 ounces per day (720 mL) is sufficient to meet the daily calcium requirement of children between one and five years of age. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dietary-recommendations-for-toddlers-preschool-and-school-age-children#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dietary recommendations for toddlers, preschool, and school-age children&quot;, section on 'Dairy products'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">School entry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transitioning to school can trigger constipation because of stool withholding if the child is reluctant to use the toilet at school, or because the change in schedule interferes with toileting. Moreover, as children reach school age they often use the bathroom by themselves, and parents may not be aware of the frequency or type of stools. </p><p>To avoid these problems, clinicians should encourage parents to regularly ask about their child's bowel movements. Parents also should be encouraged to monitor whether their child is holding back from or embarrassed about using the toilet at school. In addition, parents should promote routine, unhurried time on the toilet after meals. Finally, continued attention to fiber intake may help (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76461%7EPEDS%2F77796%7EPEDS%2F62957\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76461 graphicRef77796 graphicRef62957 \">table 2A-C</a>). The goal for fiber intake for a six-year old child is 11 to 16 <span class=\"nowrap\">grams/day</span> (based on the child's age plus 5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">grams/day</span> as recommended by the consensus conference on dietary fiber in childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-acute-constipation-in-infants-and-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]).

The intervention should include a follow-up plan to ensure that the constipation has resolved and the child achieves an appropriate stooling pattern (ie, regular bowel movements and fecal continence if appropriate for the child's age).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Toddlers and children</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2557892425\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute constipation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For children one year and older with hard stools and straining but minimal pain and no withholding behavior, bleeding, or anal fissure, dietary changes may be sufficient. Foods naturally high in fiber (ie, &ge;3 grams of fiber per serving) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77796\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77796 \">table 2B</a>) should be recommended, along with adequate fluid intake (32 to 64 ounces [960 to 1920 mL] per day) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-acute-constipation-in-infants-and-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Information regarding a high fiber diet, and a sample-menu for a 7- to 10-year-old child that can be printed out and given to parents is provided in the tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76461%7EPEDS%2F62957\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76461 graphicRef62957 \">table 2A, 2C</a>). </p><p>For toddlers and children with stool withholding behavior, pain while defecating, rectal bleeding or anal fissure, we suggest initial treatment with polyethylene glycol (PEG) with or without electrolytes (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=polyethylene-glycol-3350-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">polyethylene glycol 3350</a>, eg, Miralax) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-acute-constipation-in-infants-and-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The recommended dose of PEG is 0.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63381\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63381 \">table 3</a>). If the child has a fecal impaction, a higher dose of PEG (1 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day)</span> for a maximum of six consecutive days can be used. Alternatively, if PEG is not available, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactulose-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lactulose</a> should be the laxative of choice, and is safe for all ages. Anal fissures can be treated topically with petroleum jelly. Meanwhile, the dietary measures described above should be implemented to help avoid recurrent constipation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3884497290\"><span class=\"h3\">Recurrent constipation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For toddlers and children with recurrent constipation, it is important to identify and appropriately address continuing dietary problems <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> any precipitating events in infants and children who have recurrent acute episodes of constipation. Precipitating events may include recurrent episodes of painful defecation (eg, due to anal fissure, hard stool), fear of using the bathroom at school, inadequate treatment and premature weaning of laxatives, and inadequate time to use the bathroom after meals or at school. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Prevention and monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p>These children may need one or more of the following interventions during the time that precipitating factors are being addressed.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Optimize dietary fiber intake &ndash; Children with recurrent constipation should have a dietary evaluation to ensure recommended dietary fiber intake (age plus 5 to 10 g daily). If dietary fiber intake is inadequate, fiber supplements can be used. Fiber supplements that are safe for children are available over-the-counter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64009\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64009 \">table 4</a>). However, to be effective, children who use these supplements should also consume 32 to 64 ounces (960 to 1920 mL) of water or other non-milk liquids per day. Also, excessive fiber intake should be avoided in children with stool withholding behaviors or a history of fecal impaction, as discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Toilet training'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laxatives &ndash; Children with recurrent constipation also may need one or two doses of a laxative (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63381\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63381 \">table 3</a>) at the onset of an episode, to clean out the hard stool and stimulate regular bowel movements. A maintenance regimen of laxatives should be considered if the stools remain hard, large in diameter, or continue to cause pain, as described for chronic constipation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61175\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61175 \">table 5</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disimpaction &ndash; Children who have not had a bowel movement for several days and cannot pass a stool may have fecal impaction. Such children may be treated with a higher dose of oral laxative for up to one week, or a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-phosphate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sodium phosphate</a> enema (using the appropriate-sized enema for the child's age), followed by an oral laxative (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63381\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63381 \">table 3</a>).

Infant dyschezia is a common cause of constipation-like symptoms in young infants.

One such option is the addition of sorbitol-containing juices (eg, apple, prune, or pear). For infants four months and older, two to four ounces of 100-percent fruit juice per day is a reasonable starting dose. For infants younger than four months, one to two ounces of diluted prune juice is a reasonable starting dose. Alternatively, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactulose-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lactulose</a> (about 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> daily) can be added to the formula. However, those with persistent constipation should be reevaluated because constipation that presents early in life carries a higher likelihood of an organic cause (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-constipation-in-infants-and-children-clinical-features-and-differential-diagnosis#H704003529\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional constipation in infants and children: Clinical features and differential diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>). Follow-up and counseling should also be provided to avoid excessive juice intake after the acute constipation has resolved, due to potential adverse effects of juice on diet quality and subsequent weight gain either inadequate or excessive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-treatment-of-acute-constipation-in-infants-and-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Early intervention during acute or recurrent episodes of acute constipation can prevent complications such as anal fissure, stool withholding, chronic constipation, and encopresis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63214629\"><span class=\"h2\">Triggers and prevention</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discussion of dietary and bowel habits should be part of routine health supervision visits for children of all ages. Children are susceptible to constipation at certain times of life. These episodes may be anticipated and either prevented or quickly treated if parents are given appropriate and timely anticipatory guidance. Times when constipation is likely to occur include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Infant transitioning to a solid diet &ndash; The transitional diet often includes inadequate amounts of fiber and fluid. To avoid constipation, the diet should include at least 5 grams of fiber daily. This can be accomplished by providing several servings daily of pureed vegetables, fruits, and a fiber-containing infant cereal. The minimum daily fluid intake ranges from 16 fluid ounces (480 mL) for a 5 kg infant to 32 ounces (960 mL) for a 10 kg infant. Anal fissures or irritation also may contribute to constipation; these can be caused by vigorous wiping during diaper changes. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Transition to solid diet'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Toilet training &ndash; Children of toilet training age are susceptible to constipation because of stool withholding, inadequate fiber intake, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> excessive milk intake. Preventive measures include increasing fiber and decreasing milk intake, delaying toilet training until the child shows signs of readiness, and using a relaxed, &quot;child-oriented&quot; approach to toileting. If children show signs of stool withholding, it is often necessary to use short-term dietary interventions or laxatives, and sometimes to hold off on toilet training efforts. Consumption of cow's milk should be limited to 24 fluid ounces (720 mL) per day. The diet should include at least 7 to 15 grams of fiber daily for children two to five years. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Toilet training'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>School entry &ndash; Transitioning to school can trigger constipation because of stool withholding if the child is reluctant to use the toilet at school, or because the change in schedule interferes with toileting. To avoid these problems, parents should be encouraged to monitor whether their child is holding back from or embarrassed about using the toilet at school and promote routine, unhurried time on the toilet. Goals for fiber intake for a six-year old child are at least 11 to 16 <span class=\"nowrap\">grams/day</span> (based on the child's age plus 5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">grams/day)</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77796%7EPEDS%2F76461%7EPEDS%2F62957\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77796 graphicRef76461 graphicRef62957 \">table 2A-C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'School entry'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H63214636\"><span class=\"h2\">Management in toddlers and children</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute episodes of constipation in children one year and older can usually be treated with dietary changes, including increasing fiber and ensuring adequate fluid intake if the symptoms are mild. For those with stool withholding behavior, pain while defecating, rectal bleeding or anal fissure, we suggest initial treatment with an osmotic or lubricant laxative, rather than dietary intervention alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Appropriate choices include polyethylene glycol (PEG) without electrolytes (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=polyethylene-glycol-3350-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">polyethylene glycol 3350</a>, eg, Miralax) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactulose-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lactulose</a>, given for at least a few days until the stool is consistently soft (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63381\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63381 \">table 3</a>). Meanwhile, dietary changes should also be instituted, to prevent relapse. Parents should be encouraged to follow-up if the constipation does not resolve quickly or if it recurs. (See <a href=\"#H2557892425\" class=\"local\">'Acute constipation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Toddlers and children with recurrent constipation should be treated with a course of laxatives (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63381\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63381 \">table 3</a>), ensuring that daily fiber intake in the diet or with supplements is adequate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76461%7EPEDS%2F77796\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76461 graphicRef77796 \">table 2A-B</a>), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fecal disimpaction if necessary (using higher doses of oral laxatives for up to one week, or a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-phosphate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sodium phosphate</a> enema). Meanwhile, possible precipitating factors should be addressed. Follow-up visits should be scheduled to ensure that the constipation is optimally managed. A maintenance regimen of laxatives should be considered if the stools remain hard, large in diameter, or continue to cause pain, as described for chronic constipation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61175\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61175 \">table 5</a>).

For infants who have begun solid foods, sorbitol-containing fruit purees can be used. To increase the fiber content of the infant's solid foods, multigrain or barley cereal may be substituted for rice cereal, and pureed peas or prunes can be substituted for other pureed fruits and vegetables. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycerin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Glycerin</a> suppositories or rectal stimulation with a lubricated rectal thermometer can be used occasionally if there is very hard stool in the rectum, but should not be used frequently. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Infants'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants with recurrent constipation should be treated with the same dietary interventions as described for acute constipation. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycerin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Glycerin</a> suppositories or rectal stimulation with a lubricated rectal thermometer may be used occasionally to remove desiccated stool in the rectum, but should not be used frequently because infants can become behaviorally conditioned to depend upon rectal stimulation to initiate stooling. In infants older than six months who have ongoing or recurrent constipation despite dietary interventions, osmotic laxatives such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactulose-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lactulose</a> or PEG3350 may be required.
