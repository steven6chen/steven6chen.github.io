It typically is characterized by weakness, sensory loss (numbness), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> positive sensory symptoms such as paresthesia, pain, or burning sensations. Most peripheral nerve disorders in children are hereditary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81219\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81219 \">figure 1</a>). However, many systemic illnesses, drugs, and toxins can injure the peripheral nervous system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F69751\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69751 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>An overview of acquired peripheral neuropathies is presented here. Hereditary peripheral neuropathies and specific disorders that affect the peripheral nerves are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hereditary-neuropathies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hereditary neuropathies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=charcot-marie-tooth-disease-genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease: Genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-sensory-and-autonomic-neuropathies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuropathies-associated-with-hereditary-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuropathies associated with hereditary disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most peripheral nerve disorders have a gradual and slowly progressive course. Acute presentation may occur with trauma, toxic exposure, or inflammatory conditions.</p><p>Most peripheral neuropathies show bilateral, symmetric, predominantly distal involvement, though focal neuropathies do occur in children from various causes such as trauma. The severity of diffuse nerve injuries is related directly to axon length; thus, longer axons are affected first, resulting in symptoms that typically have an earlier presentation and are more prominent in the distal lower extremities. Most neuropathies have combined sensory and motor involvement. However, some disorders have only motor or sensory abnormalities.</p><p>The most common motor symptom is weakness. It may present as clumsiness, difficulty with running or climbing stairs, or impaired fine motor skills such as writing, buttoning clothes, opening jars, or tying shoes. Ataxia, or balance difficulty, is another motor symptom associated with neuropathy. Sensory symptoms may include numbness or positive sensory symptoms such as paresthesia, pain, or burning sensations.</p><p>Autonomic neuropathy may occur in isolation or may accompany a more widespread neuropathy. Autonomic symptoms such as abnormal sweating, cardiac arrhythmias, hypotension, or bowel and bladder dysfunction may accompany peripheral neuropathy. The central nervous system may be involved in some disorders, but this occurs more often with the hereditary neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Characterization of a peripheral nerve disorder involves a careful history and neurologic examination. The evaluation sometimes benefits from examination of family members (to detect an inherited condition). Evaluation of a suspected neuropathy in childhood is often augmented by nerve conduction studies (NCS) and needle electromyography (EMG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acquired-peripheral-neuropathies-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Nerve conduction studies may be performed on a variety of upper and lower extremity motor and sensory nerves. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-nerve-conduction-studies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of nerve conduction studies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-electromyography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of electromyography&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Sensory nerve conduction studies are commonly performed on the median, ulnar, sural, and medial plantar nerves in children. The medial plantar study is especially useful in infants as the sural nerve response is often difficult to obtain in this age group. Motor nerve conduction studies are commonly performed on the median, ulnar, tibial, and peroneal nerves in children of all ages. The needle EMG can be performed on any muscle accessible via the needle electrode. For evaluations of potential neuropathies, examination of distal muscles is often most useful. </p><p>Electrodiagnostic studies can help determine if the symptoms are caused by a nerve disorder (neuropathy) or muscle disorder (myopathy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acquired-peripheral-neuropathies-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. EMG and NCS also can help differentiate whether a neuropathy is axonal or demyelinating in character.</p><p>Electrodiagnostic features of demyelinating disorders include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Slow nerve conduction velocity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dispersion of compound motor action potentials upon proximal stimulation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conduction block (decreased amplitude of muscle compound action potentials on proximal compared with distal nerve stimulation)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Marked prolongation of distal latencies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolonged F response latencies or absent F responses (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nerve-conduction-studies-late-responses#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nerve conduction studies: Late responses&quot;, section on 'F waves'</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal or subtly abnormal needle EMG studies (reduced recruitment patterns in isolation may sometimes be seen)</p><p/><p>In contrast, axonal neuropathies are characterized by reduced amplitudes of compound motor action potentials <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sensory nerve action potentials with relative preservation of nerve conduction velocities and distal latencies. Chronic axonal neuropathies are also characterized by reinnervation patterns on needle EMG examination.</p><p>Determining if the neuropathy affects sensory or motor nerves and is primarily a disorder of demyelination or axonal degeneration can assist in generating a differential diagnosis of the primary disease or toxic exposure. Further testing may be required to establish the cause.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major causes of acquired peripheral neuropathies and their general clinical features are described here. Specific disorders are discussed in greater detail separately, as noted below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H438968919\"><span class=\"h1\">INFLAMMATORY DISORDERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inflammatory neuropathies include Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome (GBS) and chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H438968925\"><span class=\"h2\">Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The acute immune-mediated polyneuropathies are classified under the eponym Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome (GBS), after the authors of early descriptions of the disease. GBS is reviewed here briefly and discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guillain-barre-syndrome-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome: Pathogenesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guillain-barre-syndrome-in-children-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome in children: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome in adults: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Historically, GBS was considered a single disorder, but it is now known to be a heterogeneous syndrome with several variant forms in both children and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acquired-peripheral-neuropathies-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Most often, GBS presents as an acute monophasic paralyzing illness known as acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) that is often, though not always, linked to an antecedent infection. Additional demyelinating forms of GBS are Miller-Fisher syndrome and polyneuritis cranialis. Axonal forms of GBS are now well-recognized; these are acute motor axonal neuropathy (AMAN) and acute motor-sensory axonal neuropathy (AMSAN), and tend to occur more frequently in East Asia compared with other regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acquired-peripheral-neuropathies-in-children/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. Particular aspects of Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome in children include the frequent occurrence of pain as a significant symptom along with weakness, the frequent occurrence of conduction block on electrophysiological testing, and the excellent long term prognosis in most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acquired-peripheral-neuropathies-in-children/abstract/7-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-13</a>]. When spine MRI with gadolinium contrast is performed, nerve root enhancement is frequently present, and this test modality can supplement the more traditional electrophysiological studies and cerebrospinal fluid analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acquired-peripheral-neuropathies-in-children/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H438968953\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CIDP, a rare acquired disorder of peripheral nerves and nerve roots, is reviewed here briefly and discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-inflammatory-demyelinating-polyneuropathy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-inflammatory-demyelinating-polyneuropathy-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Both the cellular and humoral components of the immune system appear to be involved in the pathogenesis of CIDP and its variants. However, the precise cause is unclear. There is a temporal continuum between AIDP, the demyelinating form of GBS, and CIDP. Although the incidence of CIDP is unknown, it is thought to be the most common acquired treatable polyneuropathy in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acquired-peripheral-neuropathies-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The classic form of CIDP is fairly symmetric, and motor involvement is greater than sensory. Weakness is present in both proximal and distal muscles. Most patients also have sensory involvement and globally diminished or absent reflexes. Cranial nerve and bulbar involvement occur in a minority. A relapsing-remitting course is most common in children, with some patients experiencing a prolonged monophasic course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acquired-peripheral-neuropathies-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Increased cerebrospinal fluid protein without pleocytosis is present in over 90 percent of patients with CIDP. In a series of 13 children, the most common presentation was lower extremity weakness with difficulty walking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acquired-peripheral-neuropathies-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. While the initial diagnosis of CIDP is clinical, documentation of peripheral nerve demyelination is important. This was traditionally obtained by either electrodiagnostic testing or by nerve biopsy. Cytoalbuminologic dissociation in the cerebrospinal fluid and nerve root abnormalities on spine MRI are also supportive findings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-inflammatory-demyelinating-polyneuropathy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The mainstays of treatment for CIDP are intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG), glucocorticoids, and plasma exchange. These treatments have traditionally been regarded as being equally efficacious. A retrospective study of childhood CIDP suggested that the response to treatment was more favorable with IVIG and glucocorticoids than with plasma exchange, but very few children received plasma exchange as a first-line treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acquired-peripheral-neuropathies-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The long-term prognosis of CIDP is generally favorable, but a minority of patients experience persistent disabilities despite treatment.

With the exception of Lyme disease, these conditions are rare in the United States.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Lyme disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lyme disease is a multisystem inflammatory disease caused by spirochetes, known collectively as Borrelia burgdorferi, which are spread by the bite of infected Ixodes ticks. Adults with Lyme disease can develop a painful radiculitis manifested by neuropathic symptoms such as numbness, tingling, and burning. This radiculoneuropathy may affect the limbs (upper greater than lower extremity) or trunk. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nervous-system-lyme-disease#H10939468\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nervous system Lyme disease&quot;, section on 'Radiculoneuritis'</a>.)</p><p>In contrast to their prevalence in affected adults, meningoradiculitis and peripheral neuropathy occur rarely in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acquired-peripheral-neuropathies-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Another study found that persistent facial palsy occurred in 13 percent of children diagnosed with Lyme neuroborreliosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acquired-peripheral-neuropathies-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Chronic peripheral neuropathy, which occurs in adults, has not been reported in children. With appropriate treatment, prognosis for recovery is good. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lyme-disease-clinical-manifestations-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lyme disease: Clinical manifestations in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Chagas disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chagas disease (American trypanosomiasis) is caused by infection with the protozoan parasite, Trypanosoma cruzi. It can be asymptomatic, or can result in acute and chronic disease. The typical features of acute symptomatic infection are fever, swollen face or eyelids (Roma&ntilde;a's sign), peripheral edema, conjunctivitis, hepatosplenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy. Myocarditis and meningoencephalitis also can develop.</p><p>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chagas-disease-pathology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chagas disease: Pathology and pathogenesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chagas-disease-acute-and-congenital-trypanosoma-cruzi-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chagas disease: Acute and congenital Trypanosoma cruzi infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy with predominantly sensory symptomatology has been reported in the chronic phase of Chagas disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acquired-peripheral-neuropathies-in-children/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. In addition, autonomic neuropathy (blunting of autonomic responses) is fairly common in chronic Chagas disease, with subtle changes on testing even in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acquired-peripheral-neuropathies-in-children/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. However, peripheral neuropathy is a known side effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benznidazole-united-states-available-via-cdc-drug-service-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benznidazole</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acquired-peripheral-neuropathies-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>] and nifurtimox [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acquired-peripheral-neuropathies-in-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] (more commonly with the latter), and both are used to treat Chagas disease. Therefore, it is difficult to ascertain whether the neuropathy is related to Chagas disease itself or to its treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chagas-disease-antitrypanosomal-drug-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chagas disease: Antitrypanosomal drug therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chagas-disease-acute-and-congenital-trypanosoma-cruzi-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chagas disease: Acute and congenital Trypanosoma cruzi infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In a study of 511 patients with chronic Chagas disease and with other causes of neurologic impairment excluded, 10 percent had signs and symptoms of mixed peripheral neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acquired-peripheral-neuropathies-in-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Electrophysiologic features seen in approximately 30 percent included reduced number of functional motor units in the thenar, hypothenar, soleus, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> extensor digitorum brevis muscles; slow sensory and motor nerve conduction velocities; low sensory action potential amplitude; impairment of neuromuscular transmission; and reduction in single motor unit action potentials with increased polyphasic activity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Diphtheria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diphtheria is an acute respiratory or cutaneous illness caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, a pleomorphic gram-positive bacillus. Toxigenic strains of C. diphtheriae produce respiratory disease that typically consists of pseudomembranous pharyngitis. A generalized motor-sensory demyelinating polyneuropathy caused by the exotoxin produced by C. diphtheriae is a common complication of severe infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathophysiology-of-diphtheria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathophysiology of diphtheria&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-diphtheria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of diphtheria&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical course of diphtheritic polyneuropathy was described in 50 adults in Riga, Latvia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acquired-peripheral-neuropathies-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Neurologic complications occurred in 15 percent of patients hospitalized with diphtheria, usually in those with severe pharyngeal infection. Neurologic signs typically developed in two phases. Bulbar symptoms occurred first in 49 of 50 patients at a median of 10 (range two to 50) days after onset of pharyngitis. Bulbar function typically improved after approximately 30 days, then deteriorated in 19 of the patients. Limb symptoms affected 45 patients, beginning at 37 (range 12 to 63) days. Achilles tendon reflexes were lost in 78 percent of patients with neuropathy, and 48 percent were unable to walk unaided. Early treatment with antitoxin was associated with a good prognosis, although chronic disability occurred in some patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24346520\"><span class=\"h2\">Leprosy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Leprosy (Hansen disease) is a chronic disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. It involves mainly the skin, mucosa of the upper respiratory tract, and peripheral nerves. Most cases in the United States occur in immigrants from areas in which leprosy is endemic, especially Southeast Asia and Mexico. The disease is classified on the basis of the skin, motor, and sensory changes, and biopsy findings as: indeterminate, tuberculoid, borderline, and lepromatous. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-microbiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-leprosy#H21480360\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, microbiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of leprosy&quot;, section on 'Classification and terminology'</a>.)</p><p>Peripheral neuropathy is caused by bacterial invasion of the Schwann cells in the peripheral nerves. Both segmental demyelination and axonal degeneration occur. Motor and sensory nerve conduction is slow in both clinically involved and unaffected nerves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-acquired-peripheral-neuropathies-in-children/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Nerve biopsy shows loss of axons and myelin with swollen Schwann cells that contain the organism.</p><p>Sensory <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> motor loss generally will occur in the distribution of nerves in the vicinity of a tuberculoid lesion, whereas nerve damage may become more generalized later in the disease in individuals who fall into the borderline lepromatous (BL) and lepromatous (LL) disease categories at the end of the spectrum. Sensory loss usually involves the distal extremities first. Nerves commonly involved include the ulnar and median (claw hand), the common peroneal (foot drop), the posterior tibial (claw toes and plantar insensitivity), facial, radial cutaneous, and great auricular. Although relatively uncommon today, advanced cases may demonstrate loss of eye brows and lashes, nasal septal perforation with collapsed nose, and hoarseness (laryngeal involvement).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Rabies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rabies virus is endemic in wildlife in the United States.
