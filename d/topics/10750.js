Worldwide, the incidence of hip fracture exceeds 1.6 million adults annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Hip fracture rates among older adults are declining in the United States, possibly due to a concurrent rise in bisphosphonate use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Hip fracture is associated with increased mortality rates for both the short term (three to six months) and the long term (5 to 10 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies found a five- to eightfold increase in mortality rates within three months of fracture; this comparative increase relative to age-matched controls without a history of hip fracture lessened but persisted 10 years following the fracture. Of those who survive to six months, only 60 percent recover their pre-fracture walking ability and only 50 percent recover their pre-fracture ability to perform activities of daily living [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Hospital readmission rates after initial treatment for hip fracture range from 20 percent within 30 days of discharge (for a predominantly male group of veterans) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] to 30 percent within six months (for a group predominantly female) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Early readmission correlated with medical comorbidities including fluid and electrolyte problems, renal insufficiency, and underlying cardiac and pulmonary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Hip fracture is typically considered a surgical disease. However, medical consultants are almost universally involved in the care of these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Medical consultation is associated with improved one-year mortality for patients hospitalized with hip fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This topic will review the most common decisions that medical consultants are asked to make in the care of the patient with hip fracture. In particular, we will focus on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Timing of surgical intervention</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prophylactic antibiotics</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thromboembolic prophylaxis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevention and management of delirium</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment for underlying osteoporosis</p><p/><p>An overview of the diagnosis and management of the different types of hip fractures is provided separately.

Given available data discussed below, we suggest the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perform early surgery (within 24 hours) in patients who are medically stable and do not have significant comorbid illness. Whether to operate immediately (eg, in the middle of the night) or to wait until a more convenient time is best determined by local hospital staffing and available support rather than by the medical consultant.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery should also be performed as soon as possible in patients with active comorbid medical illness, such as congestive heart failure, active infection (eg, pneumonia), unstable angina, or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Such individuals may require more extensive preoperative evaluation and medical management of these conditions prior to repair of their fracture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cardiac-risk-prior-to-noncardiac-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cardiac risk prior to noncardiac surgery&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of preoperative pulmonary risk&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid delaying surgery beyond 72 hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unless contraindicated, thromboembolic prophylaxis should be instituted in patients who are awaiting surgery. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Thromboembolic prophylaxis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aggressive pressure ulcer prevention measures should be employed in patients in whom surgery is delayed beyond 24 to 48 hours. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-pressure-induced-skin-and-soft-tissue-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of pressure-induced skin and soft tissue injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Timing of the surgical intervention may have an important impact upon patient outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delay in surgical repair will result in postponement of full weightbearing status, leading to delayed functional recovery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolonged bed rest may increase the risk of medical complications, including deep venous thrombosis (DVT), pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and skin breakdown.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early surgery may reduce pain and decrease length of stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Failure to stabilize coexisting medical conditions prior to surgery may increase the risk of postoperative complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p>Hip fractures most commonly occur in frail older adults who have significant underlying comorbidity. In this context, questions arise about the risks of proceeding to surgery with uncorrected underlying abnormalities versus the risks of delaying surgery to perform a thorough preoperative assessment and optimize preoperative status.</p><p>A number of studies have examined the association of operative timing on postsurgical outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/11,13-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13-26</a>]. Interpretation of these data is complicated by the fact that many early studies were small and underpowered, and most did not control for the presence or severity of comorbidities or excluded patients with complicating medical conditions. Subsequent studies that did attempt to control for comorbidities had variable outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/11,20-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,20-26</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a meta-analysis of five prospective observational studies controlling for comorbidities, risk of mortality was lower among patients who had earlier surgery (within 72 hours) compared with delayed surgery (relative risk [RR] 0.81, 95% CI 0.68-0.96) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective population-based cohort study of 42,230 patients, those who had surgery within 24 hours of admission had lower 30-day mortality compared with patients who had surgery &gt;24 hours after admission (5.8 versus 6.5 percent, absolute risk reduction 0.79 percent, 95% CI 0.23-1.35%) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. This study was notable for the fact that the number of hours from admission to surgery was available for each patient, allowing the investigators to identify an inflection point at which risk of mortality increased (ie, 24 hours). The absolute risk reduction in this study was relatively small, and the observational design makes it possible that residual confounding exists, likely attenuating the risk reduction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>However, two large studies that also controlled for comorbid conditions suggest that the time to surgery is primarily a marker of comorbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/24,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26</a>]. In a retrospective study of 8383 patients, mortality rates were not different among patients who had surgery more than 96 hours after admission compared with patients who had surgery 24 to 48 hours after admission after adjusting for demographic characteristics and underlying medical problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The risk of decubitus (pressure) ulcer was associated with delayed surgery (odds ratio [OR] 2.2, 95% CI 1.6-3.1). A subsequent prospective cohort study of 2250 patients also found no association of in-hospital mortality or complications with surgical delays of &le;120 hours after adjusting for demographic characteristics and comorbid conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, higher rates of mortality and medical complications were associated with surgical delays &gt;120 hours, despite adjustment for these factors.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PROPHYLACTIC ANTIBIOTICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prophylactic antibiotics are commonly administered to prevent wound infection (surgical site infection) following orthopedic procedures. <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> was the most common organism isolated from multiple reports of wound infections in patients with hip fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/29-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-35</a>]. A detailed discussion of antimicrobial prophylaxis for surgery is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-prevention-of-surgical-site-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimicrobial prophylaxis for prevention of surgical site infection in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The efficacy of antimicrobial prophylaxis in hip fracture has been illustrated in two meta-analyses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. One meta-analysis of 15 hip fracture procedure trials (most procedures involved closed, proximal femoral, or trochanteric fractures with internal fixation) found that any dose and duration of prophylactic antimicrobial agent was more effective in preventing surgical site infection than no prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The rate of surgical site infection in the treatment and control group was 5.4 and 10.4 percent, respectively. Twenty patients would need to be treated with antibiotics to prevent one wound infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing of administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An early cohort study of 2847 elective surgical hip procedures established that prophylactic antibiotics should be initiated within two hours prior to surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. More recent studies suggest that a shorter window, within 60 minutes, is likely to be more effective while ensuring adequate drug tissue levels at the time of incision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-prevention-of-surgical-site-infection-in-adults#H3098704\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimicrobial prophylaxis for prevention of surgical site infection in adults&quot;, section on 'Timing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Duration of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, repeat antimicrobial dosing following wound closure is not necessary and may increase antimicrobial resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/36,42-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,42-47</a>]. In a systematic review of randomized trials, there was no difference in the rate of surgical site infection with single-dose compared with multiple-dose regimens given for less than or more than 24 hours (combined odds ratio [OR] 1.04, 95% CI 0.86-1.25) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of agent</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major pathogen in wound infections is <em>S. aureus</em>. We suggest intravenous administration of a first-generation cephalosporin (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefazolin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefazolin</a> 2 g) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F87204\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87204 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Vancomycin</a> (1 g) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> (900 mg) should be used in patients allergic to penicillins and cephalosporins. Vancomycin is appropriate for those admitted to hospitals in which methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> (MRSA) and <em>Staphylococcus epidermis</em> are a frequent cause of postoperative wound infections and for patients with known MRSA colonization. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-prevention-of-surgical-site-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimicrobial prophylaxis for prevention of surgical site infection in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">THROMBOEMBOLIC PROPHYLAXIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is one of the leading causes of postoperative morbidity and mortality in patients with hip fracture. Data regarding the risk of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or acute pulmonary embolism (PE) in the absence of thromboprophylaxis are not available from recent trials. Older studies found, in the absence of thromboprophylaxis, venography-detected proximal DVT in 27 percent of patients following hip surgery and fatal pulmonary embolism in 0.4 to 7.5 percent of patients within three months of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Data (based upon estimates extrapolated from the effectiveness of low molecular weight heparin and rates of DVT and PE in patients receiving low molecular weight heparin [LMWH] prophylaxis) suggest that, in the absence of prophylaxis, symptomatic DVT occurs in 1.8 percent and PE in 1.0 percent in the first 7 to 14 days following hip surgery, with an estimated 4.3 percent risk of symptomatic VTE disease occurring within 35 days of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in surgical patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Factors increasing the risk of venous thrombosis include advanced age, malignancy, previous VTE, obesity, heart failure, paralysis, or the presence of an inhibitor deficiency state (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F59759\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59759 \">table 2</a>). The most common inhibitor deficiency state is activated protein C resistance, a defect usually caused by a mutation in the gene coding for coagulation factor V and known as factor V Leiden. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=factor-v-leiden-and-activated-protein-c-resistance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Factor V Leiden and activated protein C resistance&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The high risk associated with orthopedic surgery results from a number of factors that contribute to venous stasis, including the supine position on the operating table and the anatomic positioning of the extremity. Intimal injury can occur as a consequence of the original trauma or surgical intervention, and transient release of tissue factors may further increase the risk of thrombosis.</p><p>Although thromboembolic prophylaxis is a routine aspect of the care of the patient with hip fracture, questions remain regarding the optimal agent and the timing and duration of prophylaxis. The 2012 guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) for the prevention of VTE in patients undergoing hip fracture surgery recommend prophylaxis using one of the following: LMWH, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fondaparinux-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fondaparinux</a>, low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a>, a vitamin K antagonist, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, or intermittent pneumatic leg compression; the guidelines give preference to LMWH. All patients receiving anticoagulation should also be treated with intermittent pneumatic leg compression while they are unable to ambulate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Anticoagulant therapy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16118359\"><span class=\"h3\">Low molecular weight heparin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LMWH reduces the risk of asymptomatic DVT by about 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In one review, LMWH was more effective than low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> in reducing the risk of asymptomatic DVT (relative risk [RR] 0.80, 95% CI 0.73-0.88) in a pooled population of 23,000 patients, including 2800 who underwent either hip arthroplasty or hip fracture surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>A number of LMWH fractions are available. Recommended regimens for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enoxaparin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enoxaparin</a> are 30 mg subcutaneously every 12 hours or 40 mg once daily. Renal impairment needs to be taken into account when deciding on doses of LMWH, especially in older patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-molecular-weight-heparin-for-venous-thromboembolic-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Low molecular weight heparin for venous thromboembolic disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>LMWH can be given once or twice a day at a constant dose without laboratory monitoring and is associated with a lower incidence of thrombocytopenia than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a>. As an example, one randomized, double-blind study of patients after hip surgery found that thrombocytopenia occurred in 9 of 332 patients (2.7 percent) receiving unfractionated heparin compared with none of 333 receiving LMWH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

LMWH has been reported to cause bleeding or hematomas within the spinal column when used concurrently with spinal or epidural anesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Recommendations from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are that patients receiving <span class=\"nowrap\">epidural/spinal</span> anesthesia who are treated with LMWH should be monitored frequently for signs and symptoms of neurologic impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3052013\"><span class=\"h3\">Unfractionated heparin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> (5000 units subcutaneously twice daily) has been the agent most frequently studied for thromboembolic prophylaxis. A meta-analysis of eight studies involving 623 patients undergoing general, orthopedic, or urologic surgery found that low-dose unfractionated heparin reduced the risk of DVT by 64 percent compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. In six trials looking at hip fracture surgery patients, the relative risk of asymptomatic DVT was decreased by 44 percent in patients treated with unfractionated heparin, compared with the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>A systematic review of thromboprophylaxis (31 trials including 3000 patients with hip fracture) found both low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> and LMWH to be protective against DVT (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.50-0.71) but could not determine the superiority of either form of heparin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. In another review, comparing estimates of prevention of VTE by LMWH or low-dose unfractionated heparin in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery, including hip fracture surgery, results suggested that LMWH would reduce symptomatic VTE slightly more than unfractionated heparin (13 and 16 episodes per 1000 patients, respectively) with equivalent bleeding risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>Anticoagulation with low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> slightly increases the risk of postoperative bleeding from a baseline rate of 2.9 percent in patients treated with placebo to 3.5 percent in patients treated with heparin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Fondaparinux</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fondaparinux-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fondaparinux</a> is a synthetic highly sulfated pentasaccharide that binds to antithrombin (AT) with a higher affinity than heparin and causes a conformational change in AT that significantly increases the ability of AT to inactivate factor Xa.</p><p>In the largest randomized trial of thromboprophylactic therapy to prevent VTE in patients with hip fracture, patients undergoing surgery for fracture of the upper third of the femur were randomly assigned to treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fondaparinux-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fondaparinux</a> (2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> starting four to eight hours postoperatively) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enoxaparin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enoxaparin</a> (40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> starting 12 hours preoperatively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

In a systematic review comparing warfarin and LMWH in studies including patients undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty (but not hip surgery), LMWH was slightly more effective than warfarin in preventing VTE, and there were more bleeding complications with warfarin in extended use (up to six weeks postoperatively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>Thus, low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> is more effective than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> but may be less effective than LMWH.

In one study of patients with hip fracture who did not receive antithrombotic prophylaxis, the rate of fatal PE declined from 1 percent at 30 days to 0.4 percent at 60 days and 0.2 percent at 90 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. In a second autopsy series of patients who received prophylactic antithrombotic agents, the majority of fatal pulmonary emboli were observed 30 days or more following fracture repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. These studies suggest that prolonged prophylaxis might be helpful in some patients.</p><p>The risks of bleeding from prolonged anticoagulation need to be weighed against the risk of DVT and thromboembolism. A randomized trial compared outcomes of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fondaparinux-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fondaparinux</a> given postoperatively for 12 to 23 days or for 6 to 8 days. The relative risk of venographically documented thrombosis was reduced by 95 percent in the group receiving longer treatment, but this was associated with a trend toward more major bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. At present, it seems reasonable to continue prophylaxis until the patient is fully ambulatory and to extend prophylaxis further in patients in whom the risk of DVT may be increased (eg, those who experienced prolonged immobility post-repair, patients in whom surgery was delayed, or patients with prior history of thromboembolism). The 2012 guidelines from the ACCP suggest that prophylaxis for thromboembolism be extended up to 35 days rather than for only 10 to 14 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. A systematic review of thromboprophylaxis for major orthopedic surgery, commissioned by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, concluded that there was insufficient evidence regarding the optimal duration of prophylaxis for hip fracture patients undergoing surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. The review found that prolonged prophylaxis (&ge;21 days), compared with standard duration (7 to 10 days), decreased the risk for thromboembolic events in patients undergoing total hip replacement but increased the risk for minor bleeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Antiplatelet agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A meta-analysis of 10 orthopedic trauma trials found that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> significantly reduced the rate of DVT and PE compared with placebo (odds ratio [OR] 0.69 for DVT and 0.40 for pulmonary embolus) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].

About three quarters of the patients also received another form of thromboprophylaxis (heparin or compression stockings). Patients who received aspirin had a significantly lower incidence of symptomatic DVT or PE (1.6 versus 2.5 percent). There was no benefit to aspirin in the subgroup who had received LMWH.s There was no difference in all-cause mortality for any group, and aspirin increased the incidence of bleeding complications.</p><p/><p>Thus, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> alone provides some, though suboptimal, protection against thromboembolic events after hip fracture. The 2012 ACCP guidelines recommend aspirin as an option for thromboprophylaxis (specifying that there was not total consensus about this) but give preference to the use of LMWH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Aspirin, at a dose between 325 and 650 mg per day, is best reserved for use as sole chemoprophylaxis in patients at highest risk for hemorrhagic complications with anticoagulants in whom the risk of bleeding outweighs the benefit of optimal DVT prophylaxis.

Observational studies have shown that hip fracture pain is associated with an increased risk of postoperative complications including delirium and leads to prolonged bed rest, delayed ambulation, missed or shortened physical therapy sessions, and impaired function postoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-consultation-for-patients-with-hip-fracture/abstract/89,113,114\" class=\"abstract_t\">89,113,114</a>].

Whenever possible, surgery should not be delayed beyond 72 hours. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Timing of surgical intervention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend use of prophylactic antistaphylococcal antibiotics (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). We suggest that antibiotics be initiated within two hours prior to surgery and continued to provide antibiotic concentrations for 24 hours after surgery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). A reasonable choice is a first-generation cephalosporin (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefazolin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefazolin</a> 1 to 2 g intravenously every eight hours for three doses) for hospitals where methicillin resistance is not prevalent; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> (1 g intravenously every 12 hours) is advised for patients allergic to penicillins or in hospitals with high rates of methicillin-resistant organisms.

Alternative regimens are low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> (5000 units twice daily), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fondaparinux-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fondaparinux</a> (2.5 mg once daily), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> with a target international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.5. We suggest pneumatic leg compression as an adjunct to anticoagulation until the patient is regularly ambulatory (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Thromboembolic prophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest initiating thromboembolic prophylaxis with a short-acting anticoagulant (eg, LMWH or low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a>) either 12 hours or more preoperatively or using any of the above regimens 12 hours or more postoperatively (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We suggest that thromboembolic prophylaxis be continued for at least 10 to 14 days postoperatively and until the patient is fully ambulatory (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>); patients at high risk for deep venous thromboembolism (DVT) may require a longer course of anticoagulation.
