It can be associated with giant cell (temporal) arteritis (GCA); the two disorders may represent different manifestations of a shared disease process.</p><p>When the diagnosis of PMR is considered, two main issues arise:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How is the diagnosis established and distinguished from other disorders that can produce similar symptoms?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the patient also have GCA?</p><p/><p>The major features of PMR, with emphasis on clinical manifestations and diagnosis, will be reviewed here. Issues related to the treatment of PMR and to the diagnosis and treatment of GCA are discussed separately.

The peak incidence of PMR occurs between ages 70 and 80 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>PMR is relatively common. The lifetime risk of PMR is second only to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as a systemic rheumatic disease in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Women are affected two to three times more often than men. Cases of familial aggregation are recognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The annual incidence varies geographically and is highest in Scandinavian countries and in people of northern European descent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In Europe, for example, the incidence rates for the population &ge;50 years are highest in northern regions (113 per 100,000 per year in Norway) and much lower in southern areas (13 per 100,000 per year in Italy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. In Olmsted County, Minnesota, where the population is predominantly of Scandinavian descent, the incidence is 63.9 per 100,000 per year, with a prevalence of 701 out of 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. PMR is distinctly less common in Asian, African-American, and Latino populations, though all racial and ethnic groups can be affected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H690915865\"><span class=\"h2\">Polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell (temporal) arteritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PMR is two to three times more common than giant cell (temporal) arteritis (GCA) and occurs in about 50 percent of patients with GCA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The percentage of patients with PMR who experience GCA at some point varies widely in reported series, ranging from roughly 5 to 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/1,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11,12</a>]. A figure of 10 percent seems most consistent with clinical practice. PMR can precede, accompany, or follow GCA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cause of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is unknown.</p><p>In addition to the frequent clinical association between PMR and giant cell (temporal) arteritis (GCA), there are pathogenic similarities (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-giant-cell-arteritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of giant cell arteritis&quot;</a>). Both PMR and GCA are associated with specific alleles of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR4. There is also a sequence polymorphism within the hypervariable region of the HLA-DRB1 gene that maps to the antigen-binding cleft of the HLA-DR molecules, suggesting an important role for antigen selection and presentation. Patients with GCA and PMR share this sequence polymorphism, which is not found in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Studies of the immunogenetics of PMR contain somewhat limited numbers and need validation in larger patient cohorts.</p><p>Other immunologic abnormalities shared by PMR and GCA include a similar distribution of circulating CD4+ T-cell subsets; in both conditions, Th17 cells are increased and Treg cells are decreased. The proinflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)-6 is elevated in the peripheral blood of patients with PMR and GCA and is thought to be responsible for their constitutional manifestations.</p><p>Evidence of subclinical arterial inflammation, including activated dendritic cells, IL-1, and IL-6 can be detected in the temporal arteries of some patients with PMR who have no clinical evidence of GCA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, unlike GCA, interferon gamma-producing T cells are not prominent.</p><p>Some studies of PMR and GCA have suggested a cyclical pattern in incidence and seasonal variation, indicating a possible environmental infectious trigger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Results of studies of several viruses as potential triggers have been inconclusive.</p><p>The term polymyalgia rheumatica implies a myopathic process, but the muscle in PMR is histopathologically normal. It is in fact the proximal articular and periarticular structures (joints, bursae, and tendons) that are mainly affected in PMR, as has been demonstrated by scintigraphy, ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>] (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> below). Findings at the shoulders include <span class=\"nowrap\">subdeltoid/subacromial</span> bursitis, biceps tenosynovitis, and glenohumeral synovitis. Bilateral <span class=\"nowrap\">subdeltoid/subacromial</span> bursitis is an imaging hallmark of PMR; a meta-analysis of four ultrasound (US) studies found this abnormality in 66 percent (95% CI 36-87 percent) of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Trochanteric bursitis and synovitis at the hips can be seen, as well as iliopsoas bursitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p>Proximal upper-extremity symptoms in PMR thus arise from glenohumeral synovitis, biceps tenosynovitis, and <span class=\"nowrap\">subdeltoid/subacromial</span> bursitis, while pelvic girdle symptoms result from hip synovitis and bursitis.</p><p>MRI has also shown evidence for interspinous bursitis in the cervical and lumbar spine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>] and tenosynovitis at the hands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Additionally, MRI studies have suggested a potential role for capsular inflammation and involvement of the enthesis (the insertions of tendons, ligaments, and capsules) in the pathogenesis of PMR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/19,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,25</a>].</p><p>A synovitis characterized by macrophages and CD4+ T lymphocytes has been described in synovial membranes from involved joints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4158779065\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is characterized by symmetrical aching and stiffness about the shoulders, hip girdle, neck, and torso, worst on arising in the morning, of recent onset, in a patient over the age of 50 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F91846\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef91846 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Onset</strong> &ndash; It is typically a recent, discrete change in musculoskeletal symptoms that prompts the patient with PMR to seek medical attention. The onset can be abrupt, sometimes startlingly so, seeming to occur almost overnight. A story of longstanding stiffness and aching does not suggest a diagnosis of PMR.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pattern of symptoms</strong> &ndash; Symptoms in PMR involve aching and stiffness about the upper arms, posterior neck, pelvic girdle, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lumbar region; they can initially be unilateral but soon become symmetrical. Bilateral achiness about the upper arms with limitation of active shoulder abduction is particularly common and often commands the clinical presentation. Pelvic girdle symptoms manifest as pains about the groin and lateral aspects of the hips and are frequently reported as radiating to the posterior aspects of the thighs. The proximally distributed aching and stiffness represent referred symptoms from the joints and periarticular structures of the shoulders and hips.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Distal symptoms, generally mild, accompany the characteristic proximal symptomatology in about one-half of patients, most commonly at the wrists and metacarpophalangeal joints, and occasionally at the knees, but not the feet and ankles. Carpal tunnel syndromes, due to wrist involvement, can be found in 10 to 15 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Occasionally, distal symptoms at the hands and wrists are of explosive onset and exuberant extent. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Morning stiffness and the gel phenomenon</strong> &ndash; Gelling, or stiffness with inactivity, is a hallmark of synovitis in the systemic rheumatic diseases in general, but in PMR this phenomenon can be notably severe. Morning stiffness in PMR is invariable; its absence excludes a diagnosis of PMR. In untreated PMR, morning stiffness can last into the late morning or afternoon. After inactivity, such as after a longer car ride, stiffness can recur. Nocturnal pain is common.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Functional limitations</strong> &ndash; Proximal stiffness can result in difficulties with activities of daily living, such as pulling on a shirt or coat, hooking a bra in the back, donning socks and shoes, or transferring from the supine or seated position to standing. The intensity of the gel phenomenon, coupled with proximal stiffness, can be such that patients require assistance with morning dressing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Systemic signs and symptoms</strong> &ndash; Patients with PMR can experience nonspecific systemic signs or symptoms, including malaise, fatigue, depression, anorexia, weight loss, and low-grade fever. The high spiking fever that can accompany giant cell (temporal) arteritis (GCA), however, is rare in patients who have only PMR. In general, the occurrence of any fever in suspected PMR should prompt a search for underlying GCA or other pathology, especially infection. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for GCA'</a> below and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of giant cell arteritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94607786\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As PMR is a disorder of the joints and bursae, the critical part of the physical examination is the joint examination.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Joint examination</strong> &ndash; Range of motion about the shoulder, cervical spine, and hips can be limited. Restricted shoulder motion is especially common; a classic finding in PMR is the inability to actively abduct the shoulders past 90 degrees (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F93422\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef93422 \">picture 1</a>). In about one-half of patients, distal findings can be identified. Clinical synovitis can occur at the peripheral joints, especially at the wrists and metacarpophalangeal joints, and is usually mild [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-30</a>]. Minor knee effusions can be found. The feet and ankles are never affected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An unusual manifestation of distal involvement is the puffy edematous hand syndrome, or remitting symmetrical synovitis with peripheral edema (RS3PE) syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F91484\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91484 \">picture 2</a>). In this presentation, distal symptoms and signs can appear explosively and abruptly and often dominate the clinical situation. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neurologic examination</strong> &ndash; The muscles are normal in PMR, and though patients may complain of subjective weakness, and though the motor examination can be problematic in an older adult who is in pain, careful neurologic evaluation will demonstrate normal muscle strength. Tenderness to muscle palpation is a nonspecific sign, and what tenderness there may be about the shoulders relates to articular or bursal involvement.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2689393334\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) can be normal, mildly elevated, or even markedly elevated:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The characteristic laboratory finding in PMR is an elevated ESR, with occasional patients having values that can exceed 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/hour</span>. In one study, for example, 20 percent of patients had ESR values over 104 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/hour</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conversely, studies have found that approximately 5 to 20 percent of patients with PMR have ESRs less than 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/hour</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>].</p><p/><p>Some evidence suggests that an elevated serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level is more common than a high ESR. In two reports from the same group, an elevated ESR (greater than 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/hour)</span> was noted in 92 to 94 percent of patients at the time of diagnosis of PMR, while 99 percent of such patients had an increased serum CRP level (greater than 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/31,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,35</a>]. In one of these studies, 9 of the 10 patients with a normal ESR at time of diagnosis had an elevated CRP (median 14 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L,</span> range 7 to 47 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L),</span> although mean values tended to be lower in these patients than in the PMR group as a whole (19 versus 68 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L)</span>. In another study, only 1.5 percent of patients had an ESR and CRP within normal limits (defined as less than 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/hour</span> and 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L,</span> respectively) at the time of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Other laboratory findings are nonspecific:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A normocytic anemia may be present, and the white blood cell and platelet counts are usually normal, though thrombocytosis can occur as part of a general acute inflammatory response.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serologic tests, such as antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, and cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies are typically negative. The prevalence of positive assays for antinuclear antibody and rheumatoid factor rises with age.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver function tests, especially alkaline phosphatase, are occasionally elevated, although these abnormalities are more common in patients with GCA than isolated PMR. The creatine kinase (CK) is always normal.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As discussed above, there are characteristic features of periarticular structures (eg, bursitis and tenosynovitis) that can be seen on ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis and pathophysiology'</a> above). Routine radiographs do not show abnormalities in patients with PMR.</p><p>Ultrasound (US) and MRI can demonstrate synovitis of the glenohumeral and hip joints and frequent involvement of extraarticular structures, especially the <span class=\"nowrap\">subacromial/subdeltoid</span> bursa, long head of the biceps, and trochanteric bursa. While <span class=\"nowrap\">subdeltoid/subacromial</span> bursitis is a characteristic imaging feature of PMR, it is not specific and is seen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other shoulder pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis and pathophysiology'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bursitis-an-overview-of-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management#H5126635\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bursitis: An overview of clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;, section on 'Subacromial bursitis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>PET scanning</strong> &mdash; PET scanning can also identify bursitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. This modality has been of additional interest in the investigation of underlying vascular involvement. In a series of 13 patients with suspected PMR who underwent 18-fluorodeoxyglucose PET scanning prior to initiation of glucocorticoid therapy, 12 had increased uptake in vascular regions as assessed by visual inspection of the images and by a computer-aided quantitative analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Another study of PET scanning demonstrated increased uptake in the subclavian arteries in one-third of 35 patients with PMR, though less intense than that observed in GCA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. While increased uptake of radiolabeled glucose is suggestive of large-vessel vasculitis, histologic examination of the aorta and large arteries is obviously not feasible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The practical implications of subclinical inflammation of the great vessels in PMR is unclear, and further study is needed to determine whether the findings on PET scanning are of prognostic or therapeutic consequence. It is unusual for patients with PMR without clinical features of GCA to develop large-vessel complications such as stenoses or aneurysms.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2599585284\"><span class=\"h2\">General approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no pathognomonic test or established diagnostic criteria for polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). We use the presence of all of the following empirically formulated criteria for the clinical diagnosis of PMR in whom another disease to explain the findings is not present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/28,38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,38-40</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age 50 years or older at disease onset.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proximally and bilaterally distributed aching and morning stiffness (lasting at least 30 minutes or more) persisting for at least two weeks. The stiffness should involve at least two of the following three areas: neck or torso, shoulders or proximal regions of the arms, and hips or proximal aspects of the thighs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) &ge;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/hour</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapid resolution of symptoms with low-dose glucocorticoids. Symptoms are generally 50 to 70 percent better within three days in patients with PMR started on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> at a dose of 10 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> and almost all patients respond completely within three weeks of beginning treatment. The lack of response to initial therapy strongly suggests an alternative diagnosis. Symptomatic improvement with low-dose glucocorticoid treatment can also be seen in patients with rheumatoid disease, psoriatic arthritis, and other inflammatory arthritides.</p><p/><p>Although classification criteria for PMR have been proposed by the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR), they should not be used as diagnostic criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. It is important to emphasize that the proposed criteria are designed as a research tool to distinguish PMR from other conditions and are not intended for the diagnosis of an individual patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1427005794\"><span class=\"h3\">Atypical presentations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In atypical presentations, such as patients with asymmetric symptoms or an ESR less than 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/hour,</span> establishing the diagnosis is more difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/32-34,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34,43</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In younger patients, inflammatory rheumatic diseases that can mimic PMR warrant careful consideration of other diagnoses.

Although there is less experience with use of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) testing to establish the diagnosis of PMR, it is reasonable to substitute an elevated serum CRP (above the upper limit of normal for the testing laboratory) as a criterion for PMR if the ESR is less than 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/hour</span>. A normal or modestly elevated ESR by itself should not deter consideration of a diagnosis of PMR in the appropriate clinical setting, but the combination of a normal ESR plus a normal CRP renders the diagnosis much less likely.

In these situations, measurement of rheumatoid factor and antibodies to cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) is mandatory. Patients with RA commonly have symmetric polyarthritis of the small joints of the hands and feet, which is persistent and only partially responsive to low doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>. In PMR, fewer joints are swollen, and swelling subsides completely in response to low-dose prednisone.

In this syndrome, distal symptoms and signs, often of sudden onset, are pronounced, though careful musculoskeletal examination will usually also disclose some degree of limited range of motion about the shoulders. Swelling, which is usually pitting, extends over the dorsa of the wrists to the metacarpophalangeal joints, producing the appearance of a &quot;boxing glove,&quot; with limited range of motion of the hands and wrists. Assays for rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP are negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

An association with solid tumors and hematologic disorders has also been reported, but in clinical practice such an occurrence is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Multifocal local musculoskeletal disease</strong> &ndash; Symptoms and signs at the shoulders in PMR can be similar to those that result from <span class=\"nowrap\">subacromial/subdeltoid</span> bursitis without PMR or from rotator cuff tendinitis. Local pathology of this sort is common in older adults, can be bilateral, and, when combined with symptoms and signs of degenerative disc disease at the cervical spine <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> osteoarthritis at the hips, could suggest PMR. In such patients, however, morning stiffness is brief, constitutional symptoms are absent, and the acute phase reactants are not elevated.

Explicit myopathy causes weakness and elevations of the serum creatine kinase levels, which are not features of PMR. Statin-related myalgias can usually be distinguished from PMR by the absence of prominent morning stiffness and by the lack of proximally and symmetrically distributed symptoms.

Although such patients are often younger than 50 years, FM can be seen in older patients. Patients with FM have symptoms of longstanding duration, in contrast to PMR, where symptoms are of recent, acute, or subacute onset. Physical examination in FM discloses no abnormalities, apart from characteristic tender points, and unlike patients with PMR, those with FM have a normal ESR, CRP, and hematocrit.

Slow relaxation of deep tendon reflexes, a low serum thyroxine (T4) concentration, and an elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration are characteristic of hypothyroidism and are not seen in PMR.

Contradictory findings have been reported from earlier studies, which identified no such risk, on the one hand, and subsequent studies based on large administrative data sets, which suggested an excess malignancy risk in the first 6 to 12 months after the diagnosis, on the other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/57-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-59</a>]. A population-based cohort study, however, found no difference in the cumulative risk of malignancy after 10 years of follow-up in patients with PMR compared with comparator subjects. A malignancy workup is thus not required for a patient with an uncomplicated presentation of PMR. The presence of atypical clinical features (eg, fever, adenopathy, pulmonary infiltrate), however, must be carefully assessed before a diagnosis of PMR can be endorsed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Myelodysplastic syndromes can be associated with a variety of rheumatologic manifestations, among which are symptoms and signs typical of PMR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].
