Stools that look like tar are usually caused by bleeding high up in the digestive system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F66110\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66110 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32751918\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes bloody stools?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two most common causes are not usually serious:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemorrhoids &ndash; These are swollen blood vessels in the anus. Hemorrhoids can itch or hurt.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anal fissures &ndash; These are tears in the skin on the anus.</p><p/><p>Sometimes, bloody stools are serious. They can be a sign of cancer or other problems in the digestive system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32751925\"><span class=\"h1\">What other symptoms should I watch for?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These symptoms can show what is causing your problem and if it is serious:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Itching or pain in the anus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feelings of ripping or burning during bowel movements</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever, weight loss, and heavy sweating at night</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling like you need to have a bowel movement, but not being able to go</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belly pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bowel movements that look black or dark red</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in how often or how hard or soft your bowel movements are</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding that goes on for a long time or that comes back again and again</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32751932\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse right away if you notice any blood with your bowel movements. Most cases are not serious. But anyone with bloody stools should be seen by a doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32751939\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there tests I should have?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse will decide which tests you should have based on your age, other symptoms, and individual situation.</p><p>Here are the most common tests doctors use to find the cause of bloody stools:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rectal exam &ndash; Your doctor will look at the outside of your anus. He or she will also use a finger to feel inside the opening.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anoscopy &ndash; In his or her office, your doctor will put a small tube into your anus. The tube goes a few inches into the rectum (the lower part of the large intestine). It has a light on it so the doctor can see inside.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy &ndash; For these tests, the doctor puts a thin tube into your anus. Then, he or she advances the tube into your large intestine. The large intestine is also called the colon. The tube has a camera attached to it, so the doctor can look inside your intestines. During these tests, the doctor can also take samples of tissue to look at under a microscope (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F58734\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58734 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32751946\"><span class=\"h1\">How are bloody stools treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on what is causing your bloody stools. You might not need treatment. If you do, treatments might include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fiber supplements and medicines to keep your bowel movements soft</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sitting in warm water a few times a day for about 15 minutes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Creams and medicines that go on or inside your anus. These help with pain, itching, and swelling.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More serious medicines for diseases of the digestive system</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32751953\"><span class=\"h1\">Can bloody stools be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have hemorrhoids, you can reduce the chances of getting bloody stools again by drinking lots of water and eating lots of fiber. Fiber is common in fruits, vegetables, and breakfast cereal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F52349\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52349 \">table 1</a>).You might also need medicines to prevent constipation (trouble having bowel movements).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32751960\"><span class=\"h1\">What if my child gets bloody stools?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children and babies, bloody stools can be a symptom of:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tears in the anus (anal fissures) from large or hard bowel movements</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A condition that makes it hard to digest milk or soy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection by a virus or bacteria, or food poisoning</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diseases that affect the digestive system</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Foods and medicines that look like blood but aren't (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F61276\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61276 \">table 2</a>)</p><p/><p>If you notice blood in your child's diaper or bowel movements, take him or her to see the doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32751967\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemorrhoids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hemorrhoids (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anal-fissure-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anal fissure (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=constipation-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Constipation in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=constipation-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Constipation in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gi-bleed-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: GI bleed (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-in-the-stool-rectal-bleeding-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Blood in the stool (rectal bleeding) in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bloody-stools-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Bloody stools in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anal-fissure-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Anal fissure (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemorrhoids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hemorrhoids (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
