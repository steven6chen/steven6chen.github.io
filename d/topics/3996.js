The major mechanisms are either increased platelet destruction or decreased platelet production. Severe neonatal thrombocytopenia (platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;50,000/microL)</span> can be associated with bleeding and, potentially, significant morbidity. As a result, it is important to identify at-risk neonates and, if needed, initiate therapy to prevent associated complications.</p><p>The clinical manifestations, evaluation, and management of neonatal thrombocytopenia are reviewed here. The causes of neonatal thrombocytopenia are discussed separately.

These patients may be ill-appearing due to the underlying disorder, or asymptomatic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At-risk infants &ndash; Infants with risk factors for thrombocytopenia are often asymptomatic and are detected by a screening CBC. Risk factors include a maternal history of thrombocytopenia due to autoimmune disease (eg, immune thrombocytopenia purpura [ITP] or systemic lupus erythematous [SLE]), previous affected sibling (eg, neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia [NAIT]), or specific disorders associated with thrombocytopenia that may be identified by characteristic physical findings. These include thrombocytopenia-absent radius syndrome, congenital infections such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) and rubella, and chromosomal disorders (eg, trisomies 21, 18, and 13).

A low platelet count, which is part of a complete blood count (CBC), should be confirmed by repeat testing. Although a low platelet count is assumed to be similar to that of adults (eg, &lt;150,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">450,000/microL),</span> healthy preterm and term newborns can have counts as low as <span class=\"nowrap\">104,000/microL</span> and as high as <span class=\"nowrap\">750,000/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-management-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. As a result, it is important to determine the clinical setting prior to making management decisions.

These disorders may be suggested by abnormal platelet morphology on the peripheral blood smear. Confirmation is based on tests of platelet aggregation and function.

(See <a href=\"#H12447009\" class=\"local\">'Platelet transfusion'</a> below.)</p><p>The evaluation is focused on determining and, if possible, directing specific therapy to the underlying cause of neonatal thrombocytopenia. However, establishing a diagnosis can be challenging because of the overlap of the clinical presentation among different conditions, and because frequently there may be multiple potential causes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of neonatal thrombocytopenia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnostic approach to neonatal thrombocytopenia is centered on the maternal and neonatal history, including labor and delivery, and the infant's clinical condition. Based on this initial evaluation, the etiology of the thrombocytopenia can usually be recognized (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50212\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50212 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The following factors based on the clinical setting and history can help guide the diagnostic evaluation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F98573\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef98573 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-management-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age of onset &ndash; Neonatal thrombocytopenia that presents within the first 72 hours of life (early onset) is more likely to be caused by conditions due to complications of pregnancy (placental insufficiency) or delivery (perinatal asphyxia), or from maternal antibody-mediated platelet destruction (eg, neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia [NAIT]). In contrast, neonatal thrombocytopenia that presents after 72 hours of life (late onset) is usually due to postnatally-acquired conditions such as bacterial sepsis or necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), particularly in preterm infants.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical status &ndash; Neonates with immune-mediated thrombocytopenia typically are well-appearing except for the clinical manifestations related to thrombocytopenia (eg, petechiae and mucosal bleeding). In contrast, infants who are ill-appearing are more likely to have thrombocytopenia associated with systemic disease such as sepsis, NEC, and severe asphyxia. However, NAIT should also be considered in sick infants, particularly if the severity of the thrombocytopenia is disproportionate to the degree of clinical illness.

Similarly, infants with moderate thrombocytopenia (platelet count between 50,000 and <span class=\"nowrap\">100,000/microL)</span> born following a history of or clinical evidence of placental insufficiency usually only need monitoring of the platelet count to ensure it is transient. However, in patients with moderate thrombocytopenia without an etiology or severe thrombocytopenia, further evaluation is warranted.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several syndromes associated with thrombocytopenia have specific physical findings including thrombocytopenia-absent radius syndrome, trisomies 21,18, and 13, Noonan syndrome, Jacobsen syndrome, and congenital Fanconi anemia.

Examination of the peripheral smear determines the platelet size and morphology, which can help distinguish between a destructive or consumptive process (large platelet size), and a decrease in platelet production (normal or small platelet size). In addition, platelet size and morphology can also be helpful in detecting congenital platelet disorders.

In these patients, coagulation studies should be obtained to identify patients with DIC. These include prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen concentration, and fibrin split products (d-dimer).

Higher platelet count triggers (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;50,000/microL)</span> may be considered in newborns who are receiving drugs that cause platelet dysfunction (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">indomethacin</a>, inhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitric-oxide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">nitric oxide</a>) or who are being treated with anticoagulants. Newborns with conditions such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), in which platelets are consumed rapidly, should also be transfused at similarly higher levels in anticipation of briskly falling platelet levels. In neonates who are treated by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), most centers maintain platelet counts at a level <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;100,000/microL</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12447091\"><span class=\"h3\">Preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Platelets are obtained from a fresh unit of whole blood or by pheresis, and prepared in a standard suspension. For infants who are very preterm (defined as a birth weight [BW] &lt;1500 g), the preparation should be irradiated prior to use. Platelets also need to be irradiated in neonates with higher BW if the platelets are donated by a relative or if the infant has a known immunodeficiency to avoid transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease. In addition, leukocytes are removed during the pheresis process, thereby providing a cytomegalovirus (CMV)-safe product. Whole blood-derived platelet units should be leukoreduced <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> be from a CMV-seronegative donor. These interventions significantly reduce the risk of transfusion-transmitted CMV (TT-CMV). In one study, the use of leukoreduced CMV-seronegative units completely prevented TT-CMV in a cohort of preterm neonates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-management-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>In general, administration of 10 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of platelet suspension will increase the platelet count from 50,000 to <span class=\"nowrap\">100,000/microL</span>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-and-laboratory-aspects-of-platelet-transfusion-therapy#H382870465\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical and laboratory aspects of platelet transfusion therapy&quot;, section on 'Ordering platelets'</a>.)</p><p>Volume reduction should not be done unless there is a need for strict volume restriction or recurrent severe allergic reaction. Volume reduction may cause platelet activation due to centrifugation, resulting in a lower recovery of platelets. Volume reduction may be necessary when fluid restriction is critical, such as in patients with heart failure, oliguria or anuria due to renal injury, or generalized edema (eg, pleural effusion and ascites). One Dutch retrospective study reported that volume-reduced platelet transfusions appear to have similar efficacy to nonreduced preparations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-management-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>In most cases, platelets from a random donor can be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-management-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In infants with neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (NAIT), an antigen-compatible donor is preferable. If NAIT is anticipated, the mother's platelets can be collected prior to delivery and used for transfusion. Maternal platelets need to be concentrated, however, in order to reduce the amount of antibody-containing serum given to the neonate. Otherwise, donor platelets that are typed and matched for the patient can be used. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of neonatal thrombocytopenia&quot;, section on 'Fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12447137\"><span class=\"h3\">Administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no established published guidelines for the administration of platelets in neonates. In our practice, based on clinical experience, we routinely transfuse platelets through a peripheral intravenous catheter. The infusion is given as rapidly as the infant will tolerate the volume of infusion, which is usually over 30 minutes and no longer than two hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-management-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Large observational studies have shown that most neonates with severe thrombocytopenia receive platelet transfusions according to previously recommended neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) thresholds <span class=\"nowrap\">(&lt;50,000/microL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-management-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>] &#160; However, it remains unclear whether platelet transfusions were beneficial in the majority of infants with no or minor bleeding symptoms.</p><p>In the first study of 3652 neonates, 5 percent developed severe neonatal thrombocytopenia defined as a platelet count less than 60,000 microL, with 34, 39, and 28 percent of infants having platelet count nadirs of &lt;20,000, 20,000 to 39,000, and &gt;40,000 microL, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-management-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among study infants, minor hemorrhage was noted in 73 percent, no bleeding in 18 percent, and major hemorrhage in 9 percent. There was no difference in the median platelet count among the three groups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Of the 15 major bleeding episodes, nine were due to intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), including one case of concomitant hematuria, three to pulmonary hemorrhage, and one case each to isolated hematuria, rectal bleeding, and intra-abdominal bleeding. No relationship between platelet count and bleeding was demonstrated; however, gestational age &lt;28 weeks and postnatal age less than 14 days were associated with major hemorrhage. For severe IVH, the most common major hemorrhagic event, the majority (31 of 35) occurred before enrollment in the study.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Platelet transfusions (n = 415) were administered to 116 infants (69 percent), primarily based upon a low platelet count. Platelet transfusions increased the median platelet counts from 27,000 to 79,000 microL. Mortality rates were highest for infants receiving five or more transfusions.</p><p/><p>In the second study of 11,281 NICU admissions, severe thrombocytopenia (defined as a platelet count less than <span class=\"nowrap\">50,000/microL)</span> was identified in 2.5 percent of neonates with 326 episodes of severe thrombocytopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-management-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cutaneous bleeding was most common in patients with platelet counts less than <span class=\"nowrap\">20,000/microL</span>.

Severe thrombocytopenia, defined as a platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;50,000/microL,</span> can be associated with bleeding and requires evaluation and potential need for treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of neonatal thrombocytopenia&quot;, section on 'Definitions and incidence'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical presentation of neonatal thrombocytopenia includes patients detected incidentally by a low platelet count from a complete blood count (CBC) obtained for other reasons, at-risk patients identified by a screening CBC, and symptomatic infants with evidence of bleeding (eg, petechiae, large ecchymoses, cephalohematoma, or oozing from the umbilical cord or puncture sites). (See <a href=\"#H175918459\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of neonatal thrombocytopenia is made by detecting an abnormally low platelet count (defined as a platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;150,000/microL)</span>. A low platelet count, which is part of a CBC, should be confirmed by repeat testing. (See <a href=\"#H92161940\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because bleeding from thrombocytopenia is a potentially life-threatening condition, initial management, including platelet transfusion of symptomatic patients with active bleeding, takes precedence over any diagnostic evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H350760918\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnostic evaluation is focused on determining and, if possible, directing specific therapy to the underlying cause of neonatal thrombocytopenia. However, establishing a diagnosis can be challenging because of the overlap of the clinical presentation among different conditions, and because frequently there may be multiple potential causes. The diagnostic approach to neonatal thrombocytopenia is centered on the maternal and neonatal history, including labor and delivery, and the infant's clinical condition. Based on this initial evaluation, the etiology of the thrombocytopenia usually can be identified (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50212\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50212 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F98573\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef98573 \">algorithm 1</a>). Further laboratory testing is determined by the clinical setting and includes coagulation studies, blood culture, review of the mother's platelet count, and in some cases, platelet antigen typing of the mother, father, and newborn. (See <a href=\"#H169997725\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation to identify underlying cause'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the majority of cases, neonatal thrombocytopenia resolves without intervention. Specific therapy, if available, should be given to patients in whom an etiology has been identified (eg, sepsis).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with thrombocytopenia that is severe or who have clinical bleeding require platelet transfusion. Guidelines are based upon clinical experience because there is a paucity of data. As a result, there is a wide variation of the criteria (ie, platelet level) used for neonatal platelet transfusion.
