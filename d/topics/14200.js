The simplest division of the scleroderma-related disorders is into localized and systemic forms of the disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-and-classification-of-scleroderma-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview and classification of scleroderma disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Localized scleroderma, which is generally termed morphea to avoid confusion with systemic disease, can be divided into (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F60398\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60398 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Circumscribed plaque morphea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Generalized morphea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bullous morphea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Linear morphea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deep morphea</p><p/><p>By comparison, the extent of skin involvement and the accompanying pattern of internal organ involvement form the basis for the most widely used classification of systemic sclerosis (SSc) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretreatment-evaluation-of-adults-with-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The principal subsets of systemic sclerosis are (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F80559\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80559 \">table 2</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (dcSSc)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (lcSSc)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma (patients with only internal organ involvement)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Environmentally induced scleroderma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overlap syndromes (features of systemic sclerosis which coexist with elements of other rheumatic disorders)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pre-scleroderma (patients with the Raynaud phenomenon plus positive autoantibodies <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abnormal nailfold capillaroscopy) that may later progress or might remain undifferentiated</p><p/><p>In addition, certain autoantibodies found in SSc are associated with subsets of the disease. The presence of some of these autoantibodies may also predict the risk of future organ involvement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F59732\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59732 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>The etiology and pathogenesis of the scleroderma disorders are poorly understood (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for and possible causes of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma)&quot;</a>), and, as a consequence, treatment of these conditions is difficult, incomplete, and not curative. Despite these difficulties, a differentiation between localized and systemic disease and an understanding of the SSc subsets, disease staging, organ involvement, and pathogenesis permit the most effective use of available therapies and the adoption of a strategy of disease containment.</p><p>The medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies that lead to an initial diagnosis of SSc provide much of the information necessary to determine the distribution of organ involvement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Treatment decisions are informed by a thorough pretreatment assessment of the extent and type of organ involvement, which may also help determine whether organ dysfunction is related to potentially reversible inflammation or vasoconstriction (active disease) or due to damage that is irreversible with existing therapies (eg, fibrosis or ischemic necrosis). This topic summarizes clinically useful and generally available approaches for assessing disease activity, organ damage, and residual function in adults with systemic sclerosis.</p><p>Overviews of the treatment of SSc in adults and children are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-and-prognosis-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment and prognosis of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=juvenile-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Juvenile systemic sclerosis (scleroderma)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The organ-based pretreatment assessment, described below, is more extensive than that recommended by an international group of scleroderma researchers for evaluating scleroderma activity and severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretreatment-evaluation-of-adults-with-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. These important consensus documents are based upon a minimal essential dataset and a desire in research studies to standardize assessment across centers and to provide guidelines that are applicable in a reasonably large number of countries and in recognition of limited availability of testing resources in some settings.</p><p>A multifaceted approach to patient evaluation is necessary in clinical practice, as this provides a much more robust picture of clinically significant manifestations. Composite activity or severity scores for diffuse and limited disease subsets have not yet been fully validated but may well be adapted once they have been more widely applied, as was the case for the first scleroderma severity score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretreatment-evaluation-of-adults-with-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PRETREATMENT ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Not all of the following tests are necessary in every patient with scleroderma. However, assessment of the extent of skin involvement, renal function, pulmonary function, and the presence or absence of parenchymal lung disease by high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scanning, as well as the estimation of pulmonary arterial pressure by echocardiography, is recommended for all patients who have systemic sclerosis (SSc) as part of the initial evaluation. For patients who present in an emergent fashion (eg, with scleroderma renal crisis), some components of the suggested assessment may need to be deferred until the patient is sufficiently stable to undergo the recommended tests, and when the presence of acute changes may compromise the assessment of established cardiac or pulmonary involvement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Cutaneous</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin involvement in the scleroderma disorders is characterized by variable sclerosis or thickening of the skin. The hands and face are generally the first areas involved, and the hands typically show the most severe changes, especially in the early stages of disease. The distribution and extent of skin involvement may be valuable for determining prognosis as well as allowing accurate disease classification. A &quot;skin score,&quot; based on the degree of thickening or tethering at various standardized anatomic sites, is used in scleroderma clinical research and may be used in clinical practice to follow the course of cutaneous involvement.</p><p>Great emphasis is placed upon the skin score as a validated method of assessing disease activity, progression, or stability.</p><p>The skin score is a semiquantitative assessment of the extent of total skin sclerosis. The most widely used scoring system grades skin sclerosis at 17 sites, with scores at each site being 0 (normal), 1 (mild thickening), 2 (moderate thickening), or 3 (severe thickening) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretreatment-evaluation-of-adults-with-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>It is generally agreed that rolling skin between index finger and thumb provides the most effective way for estimating thickness of the skin in moving from grades 1 to 3. In late-stage disease, this may be hampered by tethering to underlying structures; grade 3 is completely fixed (&quot;hide-bound&quot;). In practice, standardization between assessors examining the same patients and use of single observers maintain the skin score selected as a valid and useful tool to assess diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc). Dermal thickness may be reliably estimated using an ultrasound probe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretreatment-evaluation-of-adults-with-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], and other tools have been used in clinical trials, such as the durometer. No instrument has outperformed the modified Rodnan skin score in clinical practice.</p><p>The skin score cannot be used as a surrogate index for organ-based involvement, but it may be prognostically valuable. As an example, in one study of 134 patients with diffuse skin involvement, a skin score of 20 or more was the third most powerful predictor of mortality after cardiac and pulmonary involvement (respective odds ratios 4.2, 4.0, and 3.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretreatment-evaluation-of-adults-with-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A skin score of 20 or more was also the second most powerful predictor of the development of scleroderma renal crisis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Renal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Baseline measurement and subsequent periodic monitoring of blood pressure, serum creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR), and an estimate of proteinuria (either from a 24-hour urine collection or a urine protein to creatinine ratio) allow patients who have developed, or those who may be developing, scleroderma renal crisis to be identified. A GFR of less than 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> is considered highly significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretreatment-evaluation-of-adults-with-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The most common methods utilized in the United States to estimate the GFR are the creatinine clearance and the plasma creatinine concentration; by comparison, European clinicians frequently use other methods, particularly the clearance of 51-Cr-EDTA (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-kidney-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of kidney function&quot;</a>). The calculator (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-glomerular-filtration-rate-estimate-by-abbreviated-mdrd-study-equation-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) will calculate the creatinine clearance using data from a specific patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastrointestinal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Esophageal, small bowel, colonic, and anorectal function may be affected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Esophageal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with dysphagia, upper gastrointestinal contrast radiography is recommended to rule out stricture or neoplasm. In the absence of a mechanical obstruction, esophageal manometry may help to better define swallowing difficulty. Myositis may lead to pharyngeal or esophageal weakness, and measurement of serum muscle enzymes (eg, creatine kinase and aldolase) may be helpful in assessing for inflammatory muscle disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Small bowel</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with diarrhea, weight loss, or evidence of malnutrition or malabsorption should have their nutritional status formally evaluated.

Emerging data do not support the utility of routine BAL, but it can be of value in selected cases, especially to exclude infection or other pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretreatment-evaluation-of-adults-with-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. HRCT has been shown to accurately assess the extent of disease and to predict the histological subtype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretreatment-evaluation-of-adults-with-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. There is a simple staging algorithm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretreatment-evaluation-of-adults-with-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] for assessing whether lung fibrosis is mild or extensive and whether it has a low or high probability of progression. This system is being used in many European scleroderma centers to make treatment decisions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pulmonary-complications-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pulmonary complications of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with symptoms suggestive of pulmonary hypertension, whose pulmonary arterial pressures cannot be estimated noninvasively (eg, those who have no tricuspid regurgitation), may need right heart catheterization to assess prognosis and to guide treatment. Measurement of pro-brain natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP) may be a valuable noninvasive indicator in this situation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretreatment-evaluation-of-adults-with-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients should have a screening electrocardiogram (ECG). If there is any suspicion of myocarditis or pericarditis, serum creatine kinase (CK) and troponin (either troponin I or troponin T depending upon availability), an electrocardiogram (ECG), and an echocardiogram are recommended. Cardiac MRI may provide the best tool for identifying myocardial involvement with fibrosis or inflammation, but it is not usually a routine tool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pretreatment-evaluation-of-adults-with-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Musculoskeletal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assessment of joint mobility and functional abilities may be necessary to tailor appropriate physical and occupational therapy.
