The Zaire species of <em>Ebolavirus</em> was the causative agent of the 2014-2016 epidemic in West Africa, where there were nearly 29,000 total cases (suspected, probable, or confirmed), more than 15,000 laboratory-confirmed cases, and 11,000 deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Based on the total estimated case count, the overall case fatality rate was approximately 40 percent. In earlier outbreaks caused by the same virus species in Central Africa, case fatality rates reached 80 to 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Marburg virus has caused a similar disease in a smaller number of outbreaks in Central Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=marburg-virus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Marburg virus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The epidemiology and pathogenesis of Ebola virus disease will be presented here, including knowledge that emerged during and after the West African epidemic of Ebola virus disease. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of Ebola virus disease are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebola-virus-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Ebola virus disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-ebola-virus-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of Ebola virus disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ebola virus is a nonsegmented, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that resembles rhabdoviruses (eg, rabies) and paramyxoviruses (eg, measles, mumps) in its genome organization and replication mechanisms. It is a member of the family <em>Filoviridae</em>, taken from the Latin &quot;filum,&quot; meaning thread-like, based upon their filamentous structure. </p><p>In the past, Ebola and Marburg viruses were classified as &quot;hemorrhagic fever viruses,&quot; based upon their clinical manifestations, which include coagulation defects, bleeding, and shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. However, the term &quot;hemorrhagic fever&quot; is no longer used to refer to Ebola virus disease because only a small percentage of Ebola patients actually develop significant hemorrhage, and it usually occurs in the terminal phase of fatal illness, when the individual is already in shock. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ebola-virus-disease#H134221\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Ebola virus disease&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>The genus <em>Ebolavirus</em> is divided into five species (Zaire, Sudan, Tai Forest, Bundibugyo, and Reston) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The following four species cause disease in humans:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Zaire virus, since it was first recognized in 1976, has caused multiple large outbreaks in Central Africa, with mortality rates ranging from 55 to 88 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/6,10-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10-15</a>]. It was the causative agent of the 2014-2016 West African epidemic. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Sudan virus has been associated with a case fatality rate of approximately 50 percent in four epidemics: two in Sudan in the 1970s, one in Uganda in 2000, and another in Sudan in 2004 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Tai Forest virus has only been identified as the cause of illness in one person in the Ivory Coast, and that individual survived [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The exposure occurred when an ethologist performed a necropsy on a chimpanzee found dead in the Tai Forest, where marked reductions in the great ape population had been observed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Bundibugyo virus emerged in Uganda in 2007, causing an outbreak of Ebola virus disease with a lower case fatality rate (approximately 30 percent) than is typical for the Zaire and Sudan viruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Another epidemic with a case fatality rate of 22 percent among confirmed cases occurred in the northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Sequencing has shown that the agent is most closely related to the Tai Forest species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p>The fifth Ebola species, the Reston virus, differs markedly from the others, because it is apparently maintained in an animal reservoir in the Philippines and has not been found in Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>] (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Viral reservoirs'</a> below). The Ebola Reston virus was discovered when it caused an outbreak of lethal infection in macaques imported into the United States in 1989. This episode brought the filoviruses to worldwide attention through the publication of Richard Preston's book, <em>The Hot Zone</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Three more outbreaks occurred among nonhuman primates in quarantine facilities in the United States and Europe before the Philippine animal supplier ceased operations. None of the animal caretakers who were exposed to sick animals without protective equipment became ill, but several showed evidence of seroconversion consistent with asymptomatic infection.</p><p>Nothing further was heard of the Reston virus until 2008, when the investigation of an outbreak of disease in pigs in the Philippines unexpectedly revealed that some of the sick animals were infected both by an arterivirus (porcine reproductive and respiratory disease virus) and by Ebola Reston virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Serologic studies have shown that a small percentage of Philippine pig farmers have IgG antibodies against the agent without ever developing severe symptoms, providing additional evidence that Ebola Reston virus is able to cause mild or asymptomatic infection in humans. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H391090057\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The filoviruses were first recognized in 1967, when the inadvertent importation of infected monkeys from Uganda resulted in an explosive outbreak of severe illness among vaccine plant workers in Marburg, Germany who came into direct contact with the animals by killing them, removing their kidneys, or preparing primary cell cultures for polio vaccine production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The causative agent, designated Marburg virus, has caused a number of outbreaks in Africa, including one in Uganda that was recognized in the beginning of October 2012 and was contained within a few weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=marburg-virus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Marburg virus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The other genus, <em>Ebolavirus</em>, has resulted in outbreaks in Central Africa, the Sudan, and West Africa:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central Africa and the Sudan &ndash; Ebola virus was first recognized when two outbreaks occurred almost simultaneously in Zaire and in Sudan in 1976 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. An epidemic caused by the Zaire species subsequently caused several hundred cases in 1995 in Kikwit, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the Sudan virus infected more than 400 people in Gulu, Uganda in 2000. Several outbreaks have subsequently occurred in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. (See <a href=\"#H1056205621\" class=\"local\">'Outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>West Africa &ndash; The 2014-2016 Ebola epidemic, caused by the Zaire species of virus, was not only the first to occur in West Africa, but was far larger than all previous outbreaks combined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/13,14,31-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14,31-36</a>].

This has contributed to a reduction in chimpanzee and gorilla populations in Central Africa, and has also triggered some human epidemics due to handling <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> consumption of sick or dead animals by local villagers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/37,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,41</a>].

The initial case is believed to have been a two-year-old child who developed fever, vomiting, and black stools, without other evidence of hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The outbreak subsequently spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, Senegal, and Mali [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>]. Sequence analysis of viruses isolated from patients indicated that the epidemic resulted from sustained person-to-person transmission, without additional introductions from animal reservoirs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>]. </p><p>Nearly 29,000 probable, suspected, and laboratory-confirmed cases of Ebola virus disease were identified, with more than 11,000 deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. These cases included 881 infected healthcare workers, of whom approximately 60 percent died [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The magnitude of the outbreak, especially in Liberia and Sierra Leone, was probably underestimated, due in part to individuals with Ebola virus disease being cared for outside the hospital setting early in the epidemic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>In Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, there was widespread Ebola virus transmission, and the rate of new infections did not slow significantly until the spring of 2015. Extended periods of disease-free transmission were subsequently reported. In certain nearby countries (Senegal, Nigeria, Mali), introductions of Ebola virus resulted in short chains of person-to-person transmission, which were quickly terminated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/50-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-55</a>]. </p><p>The end of the epidemic was officially recognized in early 2016 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/48,56-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,56-58</a>]. However, sporadic cases continued to be detected, which were attributed to sexual transmission from survivors with persistent virus; such cases have now ceased to occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/59-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-63</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H406740544\" class=\"local\">'Convalescent period'</a> below.)</p><p>During the outbreak, cases of Ebola virus disease occurred in residents and healthcare workers who were exposed to the virus in West Africa and were then treated in hospitals in the United States and Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/64-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-67</a>]. As an example, on September 30, 2014, the first travel-associated case of Ebola was reported in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. An individual who was asymptomatic while traveling from Liberia to Dallas, Texas developed clinical findings consistent with Ebola virus disease approximately five days after arriving in the United States and subsequently died. Two nurses involved in his care developed Ebola virus disease but recovered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p>Measures that appear to have contributed to the control of the epidemic include the introduction of infection control precautions in hospitals, instructions to the population regarding safe funeral practices, and the use of Ebola treatment units and community care centers to help isolate patients with suspected or confirmed infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/70-72\" class=\"abstract_t\">70-72</a>]. More detailed discussions of how to prevent transmission of Ebola virus are found elsewhere.

The most recent was reported in May of 2017, apparently due to the Zaire species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. The presumed index case was a 39-year-old male who developed symptoms on April 22, 2017. Eight cases (three probable and five confirmed) and four deaths were reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>]. </p><p>Prior to that, an outbreak of Ebola virus disease was reported in August of 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,77</a>]. The index case was a pregnant woman who butchered an animal that had been killed by her husband.

Sequence analysis showed that the Zaire strain of Ebola virus that caused this outbreak was most closely related to one that caused the 1995 outbreak in Kikwit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p>The other six Congo outbreaks occurred from 1976 to 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Collectively, there were approximately 960 cases and 745 deaths.

While Marburg virus has been isolated directly from bats captured in Uganda [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>], only Ebola virus sequences, not infectious virus, have been detected in samples collected from bats in Central Africa, and none have been isolated in West Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/81,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">81,82</a>]. Nevertheless, data suggest that bats are at least one of the reservoir hosts of Ebola viruses in Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. The transmission pathway from bats to humans and the possible role of bats in the initiation of the West African outbreak have not been defined.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSMISSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epidemics of Ebola virus disease are generally thought to begin when an individual becomes infected through contact with the tissues or body fluids of an infected animal. Once the patient becomes ill or dies, the virus then spreads to others who come into direct contact with the infected individual&rsquo;s blood, skin, or other body fluids. Studies in laboratory primates have found that animals can be infected with Ebola virus through droplet inoculation of virus into the mouth or eyes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,85</a>], suggesting that human infection can result from the inadvertent transfer of virus to these sites from contaminated hands.</p><p>Prior to the epidemic in West Africa, outbreaks of Ebola virus disease were typically controlled within a period of a few weeks to a few months. This outcome was generally attributed to the fact that most outbreaks occurred in remote regions with low population density, where residents rarely traveled far from home. However, the West African epidemic showed that Ebola virus disease can spread rapidly and widely as a result of the extensive movement of infected individuals (including undetected travel across national borders), the spread of the disease to densely populated urban areas, the avoidance <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lack of adequate personal protective equipment, and the absence of dedicated medical isolation centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/86,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">86,87</a>].

As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a meta-analysis of Ebola virus transmission among household contacts that included nine studies, the secondary attack rates for those providing nursing care was 47.9 percent compared with 2.1 percent for those household members who had direct physical contact but did not provide nursing care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ritual washing of Ebola victims at funerals has played a significant role in the spread of infection in past outbreaks and contributed to the epidemic in West Africa. As an example, a single funeral ceremony in late 2014 in Guinea was linked to 85 subsequent cases of Ebola virus disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the early phase of the West African epidemic, several hundred African doctors and nurses who performed patient care without appropriate personal protection acquired Ebola virus disease.

(See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The West African epidemic was the largest filovirus outbreak on record. It started in the nation of Guinea in late 2013 and was confirmed by the World Health Organization in March 2014. The countries with widespread transmission included Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Ebola virus disease occurred in hundreds of healthcare workers who were infected while caring for patients. (See <a href=\"#H357230390\" class=\"local\">'2014-2016 outbreak in West Africa'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of patients with Ebola virus disease (eg, doctors and nurses infected in West Africa, returning travelers from the region) were treated in hospitals in the United States and Europe. (See <a href=\"#H357230390\" class=\"local\">'2014-2016 outbreak in West Africa'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The reservoir host of Ebola virus is not known. Evidence is accumulating that various bat species may serve as a source of infection for both humans and wild primates. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Viral reservoirs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Person-to-person transmission is associated with direct contact with body fluids from patients with Ebola virus disease or from cadavers of deceased patients. Transmission to healthcare workers may occur when appropriate personal protective equipment is not available or is not properly used, especially when caring for a severely ill patient. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Person-to-person'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infectious virus <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> viral RNA can persist for weeks to months in certain bodily fluids of convalescent patients; such fluids include semen, urine, and breast milk. However, the risk of transmission from persistent virus at these sites is not well established. (See <a href=\"#H406740544\" class=\"local\">'Convalescent period'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Human infection with Ebola virus can also occur through contact with wild animals (eg, hunting, butchering, and preparing meat from infected animals). (See <a href=\"#H450821472\" class=\"local\">'Transmission from animals'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Almost all data on the pathogenesis of Ebola virus disease have been obtained from laboratory experiments employing mice, guinea pigs, and nonhuman primates. Case reports and large-scale observational studies of patients in the West African epidemic have provided additional data on pathogenesis that have been consistent with findings in animal studies. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.) </p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-ebola-virus-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Feldmann H, Geisbert TW.
