Acquired von Willebrand syndrome (aVWS; acquired deficiency or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor [VWF]), however, is much less common, and the diagnosis is not often suspected in a bleeding patient. </p><p>aVWS is associated with a number of medical conditions, and bleeding symptoms in an individual with any of these diseases should raise suspicion and prompt an evaluation for aVWS. Evaluation and management may be complex, especially in those for whom the underlying disorder requires antithrombotic therapy, such as anticoagulation for a prosthetic heart valve or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> for essential thrombocythemia. </p><p>This topic reviews the pathophysiology, evaluation, diagnosis, and management of aVWS.

Dimeric subunits of VWF undergo multimerization, and the multimers are stored in (and released from) Weibel-Palade bodies in endothelial cells and alpha granules in platelets and megakaryocytes. The high molecular weight multimers are the most active in hemostasis, as discussed in more detail separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology and normal function of von Willebrand factor&quot;</a>). Several proteases can cleave VWF, including ADAMTS13 (and possibly other metalloproteinases), leukocyte-derived proteases, and plasmin.</p><p>VWF contributes significantly to primary hemostasis by binding to platelet receptors and vascular subendothelial structures at sites of endothelial injury, where it forms an adhesive bridge between platelets and the endothelial surface and forms adhesions between adjacent platelets, especially in areas of high shear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81908\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81908 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. High molecular weight VWF multimers are the most active form of VWF because they provide multiple binding sites that can interact with platelets and the subendothelium. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hemostasis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hemostasis&quot;, section on 'Formation of the platelet plug'</a>.)</p><p>VWF also acts as a protective carrier protein for coagulation factor VIII and thus contributes to fibrin clot formation by maintaining factor VIII levels. In individuals with severe VWF deficiency, factor VIII levels can be as low as those in patients with moderate hemophilia A [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biology-and-normal-function-of-von-willebrand-factor#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biology and normal function of von Willebrand factor&quot;, section on 'Carrier function for factor VIII'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3598497281\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanisms of reduced VWF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mechanisms of reduced VWF activity in aVWS include immune and non-immune mechanisms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F54202\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54202 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome/abstract/4-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-11</a>]. Analysis of the multimeric structure of the patient's VWF often shows a decrease in the high molecular weight multimers in both types of mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome/abstract/10,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12,13</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Antibody-mediated decrease</strong> &ndash; Immune-mediated reduction of VWF (eg, by autoantibodies to the VWF protein) may occur in the settings of monoclonal gammopathies, lymphoid neoplasms, and autoimmune diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome/abstract/10,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14,15</a>]. Not all cases of immune-mediated aVWS have detectable antibodies, however, and the absence of detectable autoantibodies does not eliminate the possibility of aVWS by this mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Some autoantibodies may have a higher affinity for the large VWF multimers, and it is possible that larger multimers may be more susceptible to antibody-mediated clearance. Certain autoantibodies can interfere with VWF function and lead to bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In a 1998 series of 25 patients with aVWS of different causes, those with a detectable autoantibody had a greater frequency of bleeding than those without an autoantibody (6 of 8 versus 1 of 16 [75 versus 6 percent]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4213051564\" class=\"local\">'Lymphoproliferative disorders'</a> below and <a href=\"#H4188762860\" class=\"local\">'SLE and other autoimmune disorders'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Shear stress-induced proteolysis</strong> &ndash; The multimeric structure of VWF makes the protein sensitive to changes in fluid flow and shear stress, and in the normal circulation, VWF tumbles and undergoes oscillatory force cycles every few milliseconds. In areas of high shear stress, VWF multimers become unfolded and elongated, and are more susceptible to cleavage by ADAMTS13. Patients who have normal ADAMTS13 activity will have proteolysis of VWF in these circumstances. High levels of shear stress can occur in the setting of vessel stenosis (eg, ventricular septal defect associated with certain congenital malformations, aortic stenosis, paravalvular leak after mitral valve replacement, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. Certain extracorporeal devices (eg, EMCO) and left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) can also produce extremely high shear stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3061961372\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular disease'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The levels of shear stress associated with these conditions (in Pascals [Pa]) have been reported to be as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Normal veins &ndash; &lt;1 Pa</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Normal arteries and arterioles &ndash; 1 to 7 Pa</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Stenotic vessels &ndash; 4 to 45 Pa</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Centrifugal flow LVAD &ndash; approximately 200 Pa</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Axial flow LVAD &ndash; 600 Pa</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, not all patients with the conditions listed above have clinically significant bleeding, and LVAD is also associated with a significant prothrombotic risk, suggesting that additional mechanisms may contribute to the hemostatic balance in these individuals. (See <a href=\"#H3061961372\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular disease'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2399771871\" class=\"local\">'Left ventricular assist device or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Adsorption onto cells or proteins</strong> &ndash; VWF can be adsorbed onto cells, which removes it from the circulation and probably leads to increased clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. This may be the mechanism of aVWS in patients with Wilms tumor, multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, and some cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), some reports have noted an inverse relationship between high platelet counts and the decrease of large VWF multimers, suggesting that adsorption of VWF onto platelets may cause reduced VWF levels, although other mechanisms of VWF loss such as platelet activation and proteolytic cleavage are just as likely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other proteases</strong> &ndash; Other proteases besides ADAMTS13 may contribute to VWF cleavage. As an example, states of excessive fibrinolysis such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), decompensated cirrhosis, and treatment with antifibrinolytic therapy have been associated with degradation of VWF, likely due to increased plasmin levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Some patients with essential thrombocythemia (ET) also show evidence of increased VWF proteolysis, possibly due to released metalloproteinases other than ADAMTS13 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Decreased synthesis</strong> &ndash; Although uncommon, acquired reductions in VWF synthesis can occur in certain conditions such as hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H548504700\" class=\"local\">'Hypothyroidism'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>In some conditions several mechanisms may coexist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3458049758\"><span class=\"h2\">Consequences of reduced VWF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major consequence of aVWS is an increased risk of bleeding. However, not all individuals with reduced VWF levels appear to have increased bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Patients who have VWF levels below 20 international units <span class=\"nowrap\">(IU)/dL</span> usually have increased bleeding, and those with levels of 20 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/dL</span> are at increased risk for bleeding, but there is no firm level that predicts bleeding. Other risk factors such as platelet dysfunction and medications may contribute to excessive bleeding in these patients. </p><p>The possible mechanisms of increased bleeding risk in aVWS include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Impaired platelet interactions</strong> &ndash; The most obvious and widely cited consequence of reduced VWF is impaired primary hemostasis due to reduced ability of platelets to interact with endothelial cells and other platelets. These reduced platelet interactions may cause mucosal bleeding or serious internal bleeding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Reduced levels of plasma factor VIII</strong> &ndash; VWF acts as a carrier protein for factor VIII and increases the half-life of factor VIII substantially. In severe aVWS, reduced plasma levels of factor VIII may contribute to impaired clot formation and bleeding into soft tissues (eg, muscle bleeding) or joints. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Angiodysplasia</strong> &ndash; VWF is thought to suppress angiogenesis, although a causal association between reduced VWF and increased angiogenesis remains to be demonstrated in patients with aVWS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. The increase in angiogenesis observed in some patients with aVWS may explain the common finding of bleeding from gastrointestinal angiodysplasia seen in some individuals with accompanying aortic stenosis (Heyde syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3082633714\" class=\"local\">'Aortic stenosis'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The potential mechanisms by which VWF controls angiogenesis may include changes in integrin-mediated adhesion and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGF) signalling, which in turn may alter several stages of blood vessel development and maturation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome/abstract/33,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,35</a>]. The likelihood of angiodysplasia in patients with von Willebrand disease has been estimated to be approximately 12 percent, although some reports suggest a lower frequency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Antithrombotic therapies</strong> &ndash; As described below, some individuals with aVWS may also be receiving antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants, which may further increase bleeding risk. (See <a href=\"#H893307940\" class=\"local\">'Patients who require antithrombotic therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2456594978\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>aVWS is less common than congenital von Willebrand disease (VWD). In a 1993 international survey sent to 300 medical centers (4503 patients with VWD) asking for the distribution of VWD cases between inherited and acquired forms, only 1.2 percent were acquired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Other sources have quoted slightly higher ratios (approximately 5 percent in the Mayo Clinic experience) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome/abstract/6,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,38</a>]. </p><p>The true prevalence of aVWS is unknown, since many cases may be clinically silent or mild and may remain undiagnosed. Over 700 cases have been reported in the literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Under-reporting is likely because testing is not routinely performed for individuals who are not bleeding. An estimated prevalence of up to 0.04 percent (1 in 2500) has been quoted based on a review of the Mayo Clinic database [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p>The prevalence of aVWS in certain populations may be much higher. Examples include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymphoproliferative disorders &ndash; Unknown.

The initial description of aVWS in 1968 was in a 13-year-old boy with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Adults</strong> &ndash; Common underlying disorders in adults with aVWS include autoimmune and lymphoproliferative disorders and cardiac conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In an international survey from 1993, all the adults with aVWS had a lymphoproliferative, myeloproliferative, or autoimmune disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. However, the association between aortic stenosis and aVWS had not been well established at the time and was probably under-reported. Also the number of cases due to left ventricular assist devices or other devices that alter blood flow and cause high shear stress may be increasing and may comprise a larger number of cases of aVWS as these devices are used more frequently. </p><p/><p>Additional rare causes of aVWS such as hypothyroidism, amyloidosis, pesticide ingestion, glycogen storage disease, and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome were noted in a 2002 review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2894615269\"><span class=\"h2\">Hematologic disorders</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4213051564\"><span class=\"h3\">Lymphoproliferative disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lymphoproliferative disorders and plasma cell dyscrasias associated with aVWS include monoclonal gammopathy (MGUS), multiple myeloma (MM), Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia (WM), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome/abstract/11,43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,43-45</a>].

In a 2003 report from a single institution that included 22 individuals with aVWS, 12 had a paraproteinemia, including six with MGUS, four with WM, one with MM, and one with NHL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The international registry report also evaluated underlying causes of aVWS in the available literature, and lymphoproliferative disorders accounted for approximately one-third; this lower frequency is likely due to reporting bias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The likelihood of developing aVWS in an individual with a lymphoproliferative disorder is unknown, but given the high prevalence of the lymphoproliferative disorders, aVWS is probably a relatively uncommon complication.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1473629499\"><span class=\"h3\">Myeloproliferative neoplasms including ET</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>aVWS has been seen in all of the myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs); it is most commonly seen in association with essential thrombocythemia (ET).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Essential thrombocythemia</strong> <strong>(ET)</strong> &ndash; In a 2015 series of 170 consecutive patients with ET who had laboratory testing, aVWS was diagnosed in 34 (20 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Features that correlated with aVWS in this study included younger age at the time of ET diagnosis (defined as &lt;56 years); greater frequency of bleeding symptoms; and higher red blood cell, monocyte, and platelet counts.

The presence of VWD in other family members is strongly suggestive of inherited disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3869464210\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of aVWS includes inherited von Willebrand disease (VWD) and other inherited and acquired bleeding disorders. It should be noted that some of the conditions associated with aVWS are also associated with higher risks of other bleeding disorders.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inherited VWD</strong> &ndash; Inherited VWD is the most common inherited bleeding disorder. Like aVWS, patients may have bleeding or bruising of variable severity, or they may be asymptomatic. Like aVWS, reduced VWF levels and function are seen on laboratory testing, and several patterns of VWF multimers may be seen on multimer analysis. Unlike aVWS, in inherited VWD other family members are likely to be affected and to have similar laboratory abnormalities (except in cases of de novo mutations or uncertain parentage). Unlike aVWS, inherited VWD is due to genetic variations and thus does not respond to immunosuppressive therapies or treatments directed at reducing shear stress. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-von-willebrand-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of von Willebrand disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other inherited bleeding disorders</strong> &ndash; Other inherited bleeding disorders include hemophilia (inherited deficiency of factor VIII [hemophilia A], factor IX [hemophilia B], or factor XI [hemophilia C]), rare deficiencies of other coagulation factors, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), and platelet disorders. Like aVWS, these conditions may not present until adulthood. Unlike aVWS, these disorders are associated with different laboratory abnormalities of coagulation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> platelets rather than abnormal VWF levels or function.

Autoantibodies to factor VIII are the most common acquired inhibitor. Like aVWS, acquired factor inhibitors may be seen in individuals with increased autoantibody production, such as SLE, other autoimmune disorders, and certain malignancies. Unlike aVWS, other acquired factor inhibitors are generally associated with a more severe prolongation of the aPTT or a prolongation of the PT (depending on the factor involved), a reduction of the involved specific factor level, usually evidence of a factor inhibitor on mixing studies, and normal levels of VWF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-inhibitors-of-coagulation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired inhibitors of coagulation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acquired platelet defects</strong> &ndash; Acquired platelet defects may occur in the setting of uremia, liver disease, and a number of medications. Like aVWS, these defects may cause petechiae and mucosal bleeding with a normal platelet count. Unlike aVWS, these defects do not alter VWF levels or function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-and-acquired-disorders-of-platelet-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital and acquired disorders of platelet function&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Antithrombotic therapies</strong> &ndash; Bleeding in a patient with any of the above conditions may be exacerbated by an antithrombotic agent (anticoagulant or anti-platelet agent). Like aVWS, patients receiving one of these agents may present with mucosal bleeding or soft tissue bleeding. Unlike aVWS, the antithrombotic therapies have predictable effects on coagulation and platelet testing, they do not affect VWF level or function, and the primary intervention for bleeding is to reverse <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> stop the drug.

This may include testing the levels of additional coagulation factors in the intrinsic pathway (factors IX and XI) when the presence of bleeding and prolongation of the activated aPTT is out of proportion to any observed decrease in the factor VIII level. Depending on the severity of bleeding, platelet function screening may also be undertaken.

In many cases a thorough history and physical examination will be sufficient to identify one of the causative conditions described above. For those without a diagnosed associated condition, limited laboratory testing may include review of the CBC and blood smear for findings associated with hematologic disorders, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) to detect monoclonal gammopathy, with subsequent testing guided by the results. &#160; </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If an associated condition is not identified, it may be appropriate to revisit the family history <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> test family members for inherited von Willebrand disease (VWD).

Plasma-derived and recombinant VWF products are available. It is important to obtain levels of VWF:RCo and factor VIII immediately before and following infusion in order to determine the half-life of the infused products. Post-infusion levels are measured at 4, 8, and 12 hours with the first infusion to obtain half-life information, with less frequent testing performed subsequently (every twelve hours or once daily) depending on the patient's clinical status. In general, the goal is to maintain the activity of factor VIII and of VWF (generally measured as ristocetin cofactor activity [VWF:RCo]) between 50 to 100 percent for 3 to 14 days for more serious bleeding or major surgery. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A dose of VWF concentrate of 40 to 60 IU of VWF:RCo per kg of body weight is given initially to attempt to reach a plasma level of 50 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/dL</span>. Subsequent doses will depend on the response of the patient. Subsequent doses of 20 to 40 IU of per kg of body weight every 12 hours usually maintains the plasma concentration at 50 to 100 percent in a patient without a shortened VWF half-life. Patients with aVWS may require higher and more frequent doses (eg, 50 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/kg)</span> to maintain desired VWF levels. The dose given is also dependent upon the site and the degree of bleeding, as shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F75956\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75956 \">table 2</a>). Continuous infusion of factor has been used in a few patients whose factor levels cannot be maintained with intermittent infusions and who continue to bleed; the doses have varied between 2 and 15 IU per kg per hour [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome/abstract/77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">77,78</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Additional information about available VWF products and their administration is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of von Willebrand disease&quot;, section on 'VWF replacement therapy'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>DDAVP</strong> &ndash; For some bleeding, treatment with DDAVP (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a>) may be effective, and DDAVP has a theoretical advantage over VWF concentrates by causing a transient release of ultrahigh molecular weight, very prothrombotic VWF multimers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. DDAVP is often administered in cases in which VWF concentrates are not immediately available and DDAVP is available, and in patients who have demonstrated a VWF response to DDAVP in the non-bleeding setting (see <a href=\"#H1365633396\" class=\"local\">'Post-diagnostic testing'</a> above). DDAVP should not be used (or should be used with great caution) in patients with a high risk of thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The efficacy of DDAVP depends on the cause of aVWS. In a study that compared the efficacy of DDAVP in 25 individuals with aVWS due to different underlying conditions, DDAVP was effective in correcting VWF levels in 15 of 16 patients without an autoantibody to VWF and in only 4 of 8 with an autoantibody to VWF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">DDAVP is given every 12 to 24 hours; it can be administered intranasally, subcutaneously, or intravenously (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F110532\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110532 \">table 3</a>). If intranasal DDAVP is used, it is important to use the formulation for bleeding rather than the form for enuresis; the latter provides an ineffective, much lower dose and is not appropriate for bleeding patients. Tachyphylaxis occurs with DDAVP after the initial dose and during the initial three to five days of administration; for this reason and because of side effects, it is not generally used beyond three to five days in a given treatment session. DDAVP can cause hyponatremia, which can be severe. Serum sodium levels should be monitored with repeated doses and free water intake should be limited. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of von Willebrand disease&quot;, section on 'Desmopressin (DDAVP)'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>IVIG</strong> &ndash; Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG) may be effective in some cases of aVWS, especially those due to anti-VWF autoantibodies; this often applies to patients with associated diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), monoclonal gammopathies (MGUS), or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome/abstract/10,79,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,79,80</a>].

The benefits of IVIG in individuals with MGUS were mostly limited to those with IgG MGUS (rather than IgM). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Dosing of IVIG is similar to that used in other autoimmune disorders (eg, 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> intravenously once daily for two days).

Available agents include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tranexamic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tranexamic acid</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aminocaproic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aminocaproic acid</a>. Topical agents such as Gelfoam or Surgicel soaked in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thrombin-topical-human-and-bovine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topical thrombin</a> can be used for nasal or oral bleeding. The antifibrinolytic and topical medications are frequently used in conjunction with other therapies for aVWS. Administration is similar to other bleeding conditions.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-von-willebrand-disease#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of von Willebrand disease&quot;, section on 'Recombinant factor VIIa'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Treatment of the underlying condition</strong> &ndash; If possible, the underlying condition responsible for the aVWS should be treated, because conditions that lead to consumption or reduced half-life of VWF will also shorten the half-life of VWF concentrates and make them less effective. However, for many of the conditions, this is not immediately possible, and treatment may take days to weeks to become effective. Thus, for clinically important bleeding, treatment of the underlying condition is important but must be accompanied by other therapies. The following may be appropriate:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Surgical correction for congenital heart defects or aortic stenosis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cytoreductive therapy or plateletpheresis for myeloproliferative neoplasms with very high platelet counts (eg, over 1 million).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Immunosuppressive therapy or IVIG for conditions with antibodies to VWF such as SLE, MGUS, or CLL. Occasionally, plasmapheresis has been used in cases with serious bleeding to rapidly, though transiently, reduce antibody levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Immunosuppressive therapy</strong> &ndash; As mentioned, immunosuppressive therapy may be useful for reducing autoantibody production in individuals with disorders associated with autoantibodies to VWF. This may include glucocorticoids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, or other immune modifying medications, including the monoclonal antibody <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, which targets B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome/abstract/79,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">79,85</a>]. A 2016 case report described effective use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a> in two patients with aVWS, one due to MGUS and one to smoldering myeloma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Both had bleeding that did not respond to other therapies such as VWF concentrates and DDAVP, and both had a sustained response to lenalidomide, even after the dose was reduced or the drug discontinued. Consultation with a specialist in rheumatologic disorders or hematologic malignancies may be indicated. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Reversal of anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy</strong> &ndash; Individuals with aVWS who develop clinically important bleeding while they are being treated with an anticoagulant or an antiplatelet agent may require reduction or reversal of anticoagulation. For those receiving antiplatelet agents, platelet transfusion may be appropriate for serious bleeding.

In some cases, prophylaxis with VWF concentrates may be effective (typical dose, 40 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/kg</span> intravenously two to three times per week).

A 2015 report described the use of thalidomide in eight individuals with LVAD-associated aVWS and bleeding from gastrointestinal angiodysplasias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. The starting dose was 50 mg twice daily (for those with relative contraindications, 50 mg once every other day), and this was increased or decreased according to toxicities. All treated patients had cessation of bleeding (five patients) or reduction in bleeding (two patients); one died of sepsis within one week of starting the drug. We would use this approach if other measures were ineffective. Contraindications to these medications must be taken into account. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4045532543\"><span class=\"h2\">Bleeding prophylaxis and perioperative management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The correlation between VWF levels and clinical bleeding is weak. Thus, decisions about prophylaxis and perioperative management should not be based solely on laboratory values but should also incorporate clinical features for each patient. </p><p>Individuals with aVWS who require surgery should have a plan for prophylaxis and treatment of bleeding available to all clinicians involved in the patient's care. For elective surgery, delaying the procedure until the patient receives treatment of the underlying disorder causing aVWS may be the best approach. If this is not possible, hemostatic therapies may be required, with the choice of agent and dosing dependent on the severity of the aVWS and the bleeding risk of the procedure.</p><p>In unusual cases, especially those in which definitive therapy for the underlying cause of aVWS is not undertaken, patients may require long-term prophylaxis against bleeding. An example is aortic stenosis with angiodysplasia (Heyde syndrome) in a patient who does not undergo aortic valve surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-von-willebrand-syndrome/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In such a patient, one might consider administering VWF concentrates two or three times weekly, following clinically for evidence of a change in the quantity of gastrointestinal blood loss.</p><p>Specific prophylactic strategies for surgery follow:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DDAVP can often be used successfully for minor procedures, as long as the patient has demonstrated a VWF response to a DDAVP test dose several days earlier (see <a href=\"#H1365633396\" class=\"local\">'Post-diagnostic testing'</a> above). This should not be done in the one to two days before the procedure because there will be insufficient time for VWF stores to be replenished. The first perioperative dose of DDAVP is administered approximately one hour before the procedure, and subsequent doses can be given 6 to 12 hours after surgery and then every 24 hours.

It is prudent to measure the response to VWF concentrates, especially the half-life of the infused concentrate, the day before surgery if possible. The schedule and dosing is similar to that described above (see <a href=\"#H222500770\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of acute bleeding'</a> above), keeping in mind the possible use of continuous infusion. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antifibrinolytic therapies may be especially useful for dental procedures and other procedures involving sites with high intrinsic fibrinolytic activity.

Individuals who are not bleeding can be treated with anticoagulants judiciously. If bleeding occurs, the risks and benefits of discontinuing anticoagulation are individualized according to the severity of bleeding and thromboembolic risk. Antithrombotic therapy should be discontinued for any serious or life-threatening bleeding; treatment with VWF concentrates may be appropriate; and consideration should be given to removal of the LVAD or EMCO if possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H679164708\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Mechanisms include production of autoantibodies to VWF, high shear that causes cleavage of VWF (especially the most hemostatically active high molecular weight multimers), adsorption of VWF to cells, and decreased protein production. (See <a href=\"#H1953356673\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The true prevalence of aVWS is unknown, but it is likely to be 20- to 100-fold less common than congenital von Willebrand disease (VWD). However, the prevalence in certain disease populations is quite high, as noted above. (See <a href=\"#H2456594978\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Major causes of aVWS include lymphoproliferative disorders, myeloproliferative disorders, autoimmune disorders, cardiovascular conditions associated with vessel stenosis or high flow, Wilms tumor, hypothyroidism, and certain medications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F54202\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54202 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2344655791\" class=\"local\">'Associated diseases'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>aVWS may be suspected in a patient with a recognized associated underlying condition or one with new-onset unexplained bleeding. These individuals should have a complete blood count (CBC) with platelet count and screening coagulation testing. For those in whom the history and preliminary laboratory testing suggest aVWS, additional diagnostic testing includes VWF:RCo, VWF:Ag, and factor VIII levels. (See <a href=\"#H101230588\" class=\"local\">'Typical presentations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1205520081\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of aVWS includes inherited VWD and other inherited bleeding disorders; acquired coagulation factor inhibitors and platelet defects; and effects of antithrombotic therapies. (See <a href=\"#H3869464210\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If an underlying cause has not been diagnosed, the patient should have a limited evaluation for possible hematologic disorders (history and physical examination, blood smear review, serum protein electrophoresis [SPEP]), and testing for thyroid disease. Those who are not expected to have the underlying condition corrected soon may have a DDAVP test dose. (See <a href=\"#H1365633396\" class=\"local\">'Post-diagnostic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of acute bleeding in aVWS may include VWF concentrates, DDAVP, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG), antifibrinolytic and topical therapies, and treatment of the underlying condition that caused the aVWS. Individuals with autoantibodies to VWF may also receive longer term benefit from immunosuppressive therapy. Antithrombotic therapies may need to be discontinued in actively bleeding patients. Bypassing agents are rarely used. (See <a href=\"#H222500770\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of acute bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrointestinal angiodysplasia may occur in aVWS; a role for VWF in angiogenesis has been proposed. Local or systemic therapies may be indicated depending on the number and anatomy of the lesions. (See <a href=\"#H2790612699\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of gastrointestinal angiodysplasias'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prophylaxis against bleeding and perioperative management may involve DDAVP, VWF concentrates, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> IVIG, depending on the bleeding risk for the individual patient. (See <a href=\"#H4045532543\" class=\"local\">'Bleeding prophylaxis and perioperative management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some individuals with aVWS may require antiplatelet therapy (eg, those with essential thrombocythemia [ET]) or an anticoagulant (eg, those with cardiovascular conditions). By itself aVWS is not a contraindication to these antithrombotic therapies, but close consultation with appropriate specialists regarding the timing of therapy, need for intensive monitoring, and available reversal strategies is advised.
