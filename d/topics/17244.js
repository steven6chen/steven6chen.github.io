The thyroid gland is in the middle of the neck (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F66834\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66834 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Thyroid nodules are common and are not usually harmful to a person's health. But sometimes, thyroid nodules are caused by a serious condition, such as cancer.</p><p>The thyroid gland makes a hormone called &quot;thyroid hormone.&quot; Most thyroid nodules do not change the amount of thyroid hormone in the body. But some cause the thyroid gland to make too much thyroid hormone. This can cause symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30633504\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a thyroid nodule?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people do not have any symptoms. They might find out that they have a thyroid nodule when their doctor or nurse feels it during a routine exam. Or a doctor might find nodules on an imaging test that was done for another condition. (Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.)</p><p>Other people have symptoms. For example, they might feel or see a lump in their neck. Or they have symptoms from having too much thyroid hormone, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling worried, upset, or having trouble sleeping</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling weak or tired </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Losing weight without trying</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having a fast heartbeat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having frequent bowel movements</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30633511\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor will want to make sure that the thyroid nodule is not a threat to your health. Tests usually include blood tests and an imaging test of the thyroid called an ultrasound. Sometimes, people need more tests. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fine needle aspiration &ndash; For this test, a doctor uses a thin needle to remove a small sample of tissue from the thyroid nodule. Then another doctor looks at the tissue under a microscope. In some cases, the tissue is sent for other tests. These tests can help doctors decide which nodules should be removed by surgery and which nodules can be watched.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thyroid scan &ndash; People get this test only if they have too much thyroid hormone in the body. For this test, a person gets a pill or a shot with a small amount of a radioactive substance. Then, a special camera takes a picture of the thyroid gland. This test is not safe for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30633518\"><span class=\"h1\">How are thyroid nodules treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thyroid nodules are treated in different ways, depending on their cause and how much thyroid hormone is in the body. Different treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Watching and waiting &ndash; Doctors don't always treat thyroid nodules right away. A doctor might watch a thyroid nodule if it is small and doesn't look serious. But he or she will follow it closely to see if it grows bigger or needs to be treated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines &ndash; Doctors can shrink thyroid nodules using thyroid hormone medicines. If you take thyroid hormone medicines, your doctor or nurse will check your thyroid hormone levels on a regular basis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radioactive iodine &ndash; Radioactive iodine comes in a pill or liquid that you swallow. It has a small amount of radiation and can destroy a lot of the thyroid gland. It is used only to treat nodules that make too much thyroid hormone. It is not safe for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to remove the thyroid nodule</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A procedure to drain fluid from the thyroid nodule, if it is filled with fluid</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30633525\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want to get pregnant, talk with your doctor or nurse. Women who are pregnant should not be treated with radioactive iodine. That's because radioactive iodine can cause serious harm to a baby. If a woman is treated with radioactive iodine, she needs to wait at least 6 months before trying to get pregnant. That way, her doctor can make sure that her nodule is no longer making too much thyroid hormone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30633532\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperthyroidism-overactive-thyroid-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypothyroidism-underactive-thyroid-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroid-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Thyroid cancer (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroid-nodules-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Thyroid nodules (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperthyroidism-overactive-thyroid-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypothyroidism-underactive-thyroid-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithyroid-drugs-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Antithyroid drugs (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
