Patients in palliative care range from fully functional (especially if newly diagnosed with an incurable illness) to extremely limited (particularly at the end of life). Palliative services, including setting patient-centered achievable goals for medical care and aggressive symptom management, should be routinely offered alongside curative and disease-modifying treatments for patients with serious illnesses.</p><p>Medically-assisted nutrition and hydration should be considered medical interventions rather than a basic provision of comfort. Promoting early discussions with the patient and family about the goals of care and treatment choices, including the expected benefits and burdens of artificial nutrition and hydration based upon the best available evidence, is ethically appropriate, respects family and patient autonomy, and facilitates informed decision making.</p><p>This topic will address the role of artificial nutrition <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hydration specifically as it applies to patients in palliative care who are in the last days or weeks of life. The issues involving the cessation of hydration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nutrition are most relevant to patients at the end of life, where there is little evidence that nutrition or hydration offers any benefit.</p><p>The role of artificial nutrition in patients not at the end of life is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-role-of-parenteral-and-enteral-oral-nutritional-support-in-patients-with-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The role of parenteral and enteral/oral nutritional support in patients with cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-parenteral-nutrition\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition support in critically ill patients: Parenteral nutrition&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, the ethical and legal issues surrounding withholding and withdrawing of other forms of medical treatment at the end of life are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethical-issues-in-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ethical issues in palliative care&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=legal-aspects-in-palliative-and-end-of-life-care-in-the-united-states#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Legal aspects in palliative and end of life care in the United States&quot;, section on 'Medical interventions that can be stopped'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H529921019\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following definitions will be used in addressing both interventions:</p><p><strong>Artificial nutrition</strong> involves non-oral enteral or parenteral delivery of nutrients. Enteral approaches include nasogastric (NG), percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy jejunostomy (PEG-J), or gastrojejunostomy tubes. Parenteral delivery can involve peripheral intravenous access or central venous access. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-enteral-nutrition\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition support in critically ill patients: Enteral nutrition&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nasogastric-and-nasoenteric-tubes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nasogastric and nasoenteric tubes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-parenteral-nutrition\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition support in critically ill patients: Parenteral nutrition&quot;</a>.)</p><p><strong>Artificial hydration</strong> involves the provision of water or electrolyte solutions by any route other than the mouth. This can be achieved by intravenous, subcutaneous (hypodermoclysis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stopping-nutrition-and-hydration-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], dermal (dermoclysis), and rectal (proctoclysis) administration.</p><p><strong>Voluntary stopping of eating and drinking (VSED)</strong> includes the decision to stop normal eating and drinking or artificially administered nutrition and hydration. The voluntary cessation of intake is a medically acceptable step that patients or their families (on behalf of patients who are no longer competent) may choose as a response of last resort for patients at the end of life facing intolerable suffering. (See <a href=\"#H2443404\" class=\"local\">'Voluntary stopping of eating and drinking'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H691580470\"><span class=\"h1\">FLUID DEFICITS AT THE END OF LIFE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fluid homeostasis is the maintenance of a relatively constant and stable composition of body fluids. It is achieved in normal individuals by matching daily water intake to fluid losses. The average amount of water lost (and consumed) per day in the average adult is about 2500 mL. The most important means by which the body loses water is through the kidney. Hormonally-controlled mechanisms regulate water balance by controlling the rate of urinary excretion of water and electrolytes. Other sources of fluid loss include the GI tract, lungs, and skin (insensible water loss), which account for approximately 800 to 850 mL of water per day. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintenance-and-replacement-fluid-therapy-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintenance and replacement fluid therapy in adults&quot;, section on 'Water balance'</a>.)</p><p>Fluid deficits in terminally ill patients are frequently multifactorial in etiology. However, regardless of the cause, the end result is total body water depletion and decreased renal function. There are two broad categories of fluid deficit disorders, dehydration and hypovolemia, which may present separately or together (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-disorders-of-water-balance-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-and-sodium-balance-hypovolemia-and-edema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of disorders of water balance (hyponatremia and hypernatremia) and sodium balance (hypovolemia and edema)&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dehydration, which results from total body water depletion</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypovolemia results from loss of both salt and water mainly from the extracellular (intravascular) space</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H691582715\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The dying process is characterized by diminished oral intake, progressive fluid deficits, and progressive accumulation of drugs (including opioids) and their metabolites, which can cause new symptoms or exacerbate existing ones (eg, fatigue, dizziness, myoclonus, sedation, and hallucinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stopping-nutrition-and-hydration-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]). This in turn leads to a further decline in the individual's ability to obtain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> drink fluids. During this process, patients may have diminished awareness, which may decrease their perception of thirst and hunger as they naturally progress toward coma and death.</p><p>While clinicians commonly associate several signs and symptoms with dehydration (eg, hypernatremia, thirst, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, fatigue and irritability) or hypovolemia (eg, diminished skin turgor, orthostatic hypotension, and dizziness), they may not be highly specific in terminally ill patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stopping-nutrition-and-hydration-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/4-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-9</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A cross-sectional study of 88 terminally ill cancer patients in an inpatient palliative care program found that the sensation of thirst was frequent, but was associated with not only dehydration and hyperosmolality, but also with several other features of terminal illness, including overall poor general condition, stomatitis, oral breathing, and the administration of opioids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stopping-nutrition-and-hydration-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A cross-sectional survey of 52 inpatient palliative care patients found no association between thirst and commonly used objective measures (eg, fluid intake, plasma osmolality, or serum sodium and urea measurements) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stopping-nutrition-and-hydration-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast, a study of 68 cancer patients who were observed during the last 48 hours of their lives showed that state of consciousness was inversely correlated with serum sodium and urine osmolality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stopping-nutrition-and-hydration-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Studies of thirst in dying patients conclude that there is little relationship between artificial hydration and thirst [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stopping-nutrition-and-hydration-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/7,8,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,10,11</a>].

At the same time, there are culturally divergent approaches to end-of-life decision making worldwide that influence choices about the use of artificial nutrition and hydration in terminally ill patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stopping-nutrition-and-hydration-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>Some families may view nutrition and hydration as a source of support and a sign of respect and caring, rather than a medical intervention, even when provided by artificial means. Clinicians should recognize that for such families, the decision to continue nutrition and hydration may not be viewed solely as a medical decision.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H691583294\"><span class=\"h2\">Defining goals of care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major goal of artificial nutrition should be to provide nourishment to patients whose quality of life or life expectancy can be improved. Unfortunately, goals such as these may not be realistic for patients at the end of life. </p><p>The administration of artificial nutrition <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hydration has also been used in an effort to prevent or reverse distressing symptoms (such as difficulty swallowing) in patients at the end of life. However, decisions about artificial nutrition and hydration should be handled separately from decisions about symptom management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=swallowing-disorders-and-aspiration-in-palliative-care-assessment-and-strategies-for-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Swallowing disorders and aspiration in palliative care: Assessment and strategies for management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Challenging treatment choices such as whether to start artificial nutrition <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hydration arise commonly in patients in the terminal phase of a serious illness, and high-quality discussions about what is important to them promote good decision-making and patient-centered care. Understanding the patient&rsquo;s values, preferences, and care goals in the context of a serious illness allows the clinician to align the care provided with what is most important to the patient. Discussing goals of care is a unique skill that should be separated conceptually from talking about prognosis or delivering bad news. While discussions about goals of care may involve some of the same principles as other difficult communication tasks, these discussions demand a different framework. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=discussing-goals-of-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Discussing goals of care&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H691577442\"><span class=\"h2\">Artificial nutrition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there are data to support the use of artificial nutrition in cases where patients desire to prolong life at earlier stages of a serious illness, there is a lack of well-designed studies to assess the benefit of artificial nutrition at the end of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stopping-nutrition-and-hydration-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Coupled with the potential for harm, we do not advocate the routine use of enteral or parenteral nutritional support in patients receiving palliative care.</p><p>Artificial nutrition appears to be of benefit to some patients with chronic illnesses, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stopping-nutrition-and-hydration-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] and those in a permanent vegetative state (PVS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stopping-nutrition-and-hydration-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In these populations, nutrition can extend survival by months to years. In addition, patients with cancer who are unable to eat due to cancer- or treatment-related complications (eg, patients with head and neck cancers, those undergoing intensive radiation therapy, those undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant, and those with gastrointestinal obstruction at their initial presentation), may benefit from parenteral nutrition, particularly when they are newly diagnosed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stopping-nutrition-and-hydration-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastrostomy-tubes-uses-patient-selection-and-efficacy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastrostomy tubes: Uses, patient selection, and efficacy in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-enteral-nutrition#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition support in critically ill patients: Enteral nutrition&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-parenteral-nutrition#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition support in critically ill patients: Parenteral nutrition&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a>.)</p><p>Beyond these clinical settings, studies indicate that artificial nutrition has no effect on prolonging life or improving functional status in the setting of many advanced illnesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stopping-nutrition-and-hydration-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Representative findings in the literature include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with advanced cancer often have clinical evidence of muscle wasting, known as cancer cachexia. While patients who are not in the terminal phase of cancer may benefit from nutritional support and other medical therapies for cancer cachexia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stopping-nutrition-and-hydration-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], low-quality evidence indicates that the administration of enteral or parenteral nutrition in the last days to weeks of life rarely changes the course of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stopping-nutrition-and-hydration-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. In a 2006 review of the literature on the role of artificial nutrition in patients with terminally ill cancer, the authors find little evidence to support its use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stopping-nutrition-and-hydration-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, there have been no randomized trials to help inform the assessment of the risks and benefits more clearly in this population.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Preclinical work suggests that the lack of benefit with parenteral nutrition in patients with cancer cachexia may be related to the release of cytokines that decrease protein synthesis and increase protein degradation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stopping-nutrition-and-hydration-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Similar mechanisms relating to cachexia may exist in other diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stopping-nutrition-and-hydration-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Although high-quality data are lacking, multiple observational [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stopping-nutrition-and-hydration-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/25-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-28</a>] and retrospective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stopping-nutrition-and-hydration-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>] studies consistently demonstrate the lack of benefit to artificial nutrition for these patients. While one might expect pressure sores to be reduced (in light of the importance of good nutritional status for wound healing), it is likely that immobility and incontinence undermine the potential benefit of tube feeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stopping-nutrition-and-hydration-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

However, we do not advocate the routine administration of artificial hydration as a means to maintain intravascular volume for patients at or near the end of life. Multiple studies demonstrate routine hydration generally does not improve outcomes for patients near the end of life (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F90308\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90308 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>The limited value of artificial hydration was most convincingly shown in a 2013 randomized trial that included 129 patients with advanced cancer receiving hospice care, who were randomly assigned to receive parenteral hydration (1 L of normal saline over four hours daily) or placebo (100 mL per day) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stopping-nutrition-and-hydration-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The primary objective of this study was to prevent the onset of delirium. The main results were:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There was no difference between treatment and control groups in delirium scores or dehydration symptoms (a composite score of fatigue, myoclonus, sedation, and hallucinations), at day four or day seven.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival (median, 21 versus 15 days for patients undergoing hydration or placebo, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients in both groups noted improvement in symptoms of dehydration at day four, suggesting these benefits may be more related to either the increased frequency of visits and assessments by research nurses or a placebo effect rather than the provision of fluids.</p><p/><p>While this study is the best thus far to show that hydration had little impact on symptoms or survival for patients at the end of life, these results should be interpreted cautiously, as some patients may find a potential six-day increase in survival at the end of life meaningful. In addition, it should be noted that this trial excluded patients with severe dehydration (eg, those presenting with hemodynamic instability or altered mentation) and patients with a diagnosis other than end-stage cancer. Therefore, it is not clear if we can extrapolate these results to other populations.</p><p>However, patients and their families have strongly held beliefs about assisted hydration, and these beliefs inform their interactions with health care professionals. In a separate report from this trial, interviews were conducted among patients on the hydration arm (n = 85) and their caregivers (n = 84) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stopping-nutrition-and-hydration-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The main finding was that among this group, artificial hydration was viewed as a means to enhance comfort, quality of life, and dignity by reducing symptoms (eg, fatigue) and increasing alertness. Although these findings must be interpreted cautiously, since the views of patients who did not receive hydration (and their family members) were not ascertained, they emphasize the importance of taking the patient&rsquo;s specific diagnosis, wishes, and hopes into consideration when discussions about the role of artificial hydration arise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stopping-nutrition-and-hydration-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H691583494\"><span class=\"h3\">Impact of palliative care location</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The administration of artificial hydration may depend on where the patient is living out his or her final weeks of life. The vast majority of patients with advanced cancer who die in acute care hospitals receive hydration until shortly before death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stopping-nutrition-and-hydration-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/2,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,35</a>], while most patients who die in hospice or at home receive no fluids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stopping-nutrition-and-hydration-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/4,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,42</a>].</p><p>This finding is at least partly related to reimbursement issues. For example, in the United States, without a need for IV therapy, utilization rules from third party insurers make it difficult to justify billing solely for inpatient hydration; in addition, the per diem hospice funding mechanism makes the administration of parenteral fluids outside of an inpatient facility difficult to finance.

The main results were:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Compared with an even smaller number of patients who chose physician-assisted death (n = 55), those choosing to cease oral intake were significantly older (74 versus 64 years, respectively) and were less likely to have been evaluated by a mental health professional (9 versus 45 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Among 102 patients who ceased eating or drinking and were followed until death, the quality of the dying experience, as rated by nurses, was very good (8 on a scale of 0 to 9). Although they were perceived to have had a similar level of pain and overall quality of death compared with those who chose physician-assisted death, the nurses perceived them as having suffered less. The topic of physician-assisted death is discussed separately.

In a comparison of six European countries (Belgium, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland), in which a total 20,480 of deaths were reviewed, the percentage of deaths that were preceded by a decision to forgo artificial nutrition and hydration (ANH) varied from 2.6 percent in Italy to 10.9 percent in the Netherlands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stopping-nutrition-and-hydration-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In a national lookback study conducted in the Netherlands, clinicians received a questionnaire about end of life decisions for 6600 patients in three age groups: 17 to 64, 65 to 79, and 80 and older. Treatment of some sort was foregone for 37 percent of patients and withholding of artificial nutrition and hydration was the most frequently withheld treatment in all age groups. Withholding artificial <span class=\"nowrap\">hydration/nutrition</span> was significantly higher (OR 2.04) for the group aged 65 to 79 when compared to the youngest patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stopping-nutrition-and-hydration-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p>Although VSED is seen as a choice that is almost entirely under the patient&rsquo;s control, in practice, clinician participation is critical in terms of both initial assessment and ongoing management. A key aspect of the initial assessment is to ensure that the patient has decision-making capacity, the decision is not influenced by mental illness, the patient is fully informed of the risks and alternatives, and the choice is voluntary. Patients should understand that VSED may be difficult, suffering may worsen, and thirst may be difficult to manage. Patients embarking on VSED will need palliative care to manage the associated thirst, and substantial caregiver emotional support to respond to watching the progressive disability.

These include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitor drug dosages, particularly pain medications, because dehydration may be accompanied by reduced consciousness and reduced drug elimination.</p><p/><p>If the patient is able, continue or encourage oral intake if it is compatible with the overall goals of care and comfort. Efforts to encourage oral intake should include hand-feeding, providing sufficient time to feed the patient; selecting food that has appropriate temperature, taste, and consistency (using thickeners as needed); offering foods with strong flavors; using techniques such as placing the food well into the mouth; varying the size and frequency of the meals; promoting good cough after each swallow to reduce aspiration; and avoiding distractions while eating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stopping-nutrition-and-hydration-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>If the effort to eat and drink becomes too draining or is not welcome, the patient should not be pressured to make this effort. To alleviate symptoms of dry mouth and thirst, mouth care should be administered, including oral cleaning, ice chips, popsicles, and the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-saliva-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">artificial saliva</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stopping-nutrition-and-hydration-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. To moisten the lips, petroleum jelly, water-based lubricants, or lip moisturizers can be applied. For patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), an &ldquo;ICU bundle&rdquo; of oral swab wipes, sterile ice-cold water sprays, and a lip moisturizer have been shown to decrease thirst intensity, thirst distress, and dry mouth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stopping-nutrition-and-hydration-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].

Families who consider nutrition and hydration to have symbolic value that extends beyond the bounds of medical care should have their point of view respected so long as it does not conflict with the patient&rsquo;s previously expressed wishes. In general, families and loved ones appreciate an explanation of what is happening with their loved one as it relates to the dying process, and find reassurance that symptoms can be palliated. The family should be helped to understand that artificial nutrition and hydration is a medical treatment that is often not indicated when the patient is dying and will not improve the patient&rsquo;s condition. Furthermore, iatrogenic overhydration can lead to pain and dyspnea from fluid retention. Giving the family a realistic estimate of the time until death can prepare them to handle the ensuing time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stopping-nutrition-and-hydration-at-the-end-of-life/abstract/50,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,58</a>].

Some patients may cease to request fluids on being reminded of their goals and prior decisions; efforts to intensify mouth care and manage delirium may blunt the discomfort of thirst. However, if the patient repeatedly requests to drink, caregivers may find it difficult not to provide fluids even if there was an initial agreement. This is a difficult balance. Although it would seem unethical to withhold oral fluids from a confused thirsty patient who repeatedly requests to drink, on the other hand, patients may be upset when they drink fluids, the delirium clears, and they find that their plans for the dying process have been thwarted. A formal ethics consultation may be needed in such difficult cases. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &ldquo;The Basics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beyond the Basics.&rdquo; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients.

(See <a href=\"#H549792351\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluid deficits in terminally ill patients are frequently multifactorial in etiology. However, regardless of the cause, the end result is total body water depletion and decreased renal function. (See <a href=\"#H691580470\" class=\"local\">'Fluid deficits at the end of life'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major goal of artificial nutrition should be to provide nourishment to patients whose quality of life or life expectancy can be improved. In addition, the administration of fluids has been used in an effort to prevent or reverse distressing symptoms in this population. These goals suggest that decisions about the use of artificial nutrition and the use of artificial hydration may arise separately and the merits of these interventions may need to be evaluated separately. (See <a href=\"#H691583294\" class=\"local\">'Defining goals of care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients at the end of life, we suggest not providing artificial nutrition (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H691577442\" class=\"local\">'Artificial nutrition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients at the end of life, we suggest not providing artificial hydration, particularly those with end-stage cancer (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). However, decisions regarding artificial hydration should take into account the patient&rsquo;s values and preferences as some patients may find any gain in survival as clinically meaningful. (See <a href=\"#H691578713\" class=\"local\">'Artificial hydration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Voluntary stopping of eating and drinking (VSED) is a medically acceptable option that patients or their families may choose. Such voluntary cessation is reported to consistently occur among a small minority of patients in many countries in North America and Europe. At the same time, clinicians should be aware that some religions, particularly Catholicism, may view VSED as an act to intentionally shorten life that is forbidden. (See <a href=\"#H2443404\" class=\"local\">'Voluntary stopping of eating and drinking'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A key aspect of initial assessment for a patient who asks about VSED is to ensure that the patient has decision-making capacity, the decision is not influenced by mental illness, the patient is fully informed of the risks and alternatives, and the choice is voluntary. Patients should understand that VSED may be difficult, suffering may worsen, and thirst may be difficult to manage. Patients embarking on VSED will need palliative care to manage the associated thirst, and substantial caregiver emotional support.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who wish to forgo artificial nutrition and hydration at the end of life should be encouraged to complete advance directives that comply with the specific requirements of their state. (See <a href=\"#H549792365\" class=\"local\">'Withholding and withdrawal of artificial nutrition and hydration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The approach to decision making about withdrawing or withholding artificial nutrition <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hydration in a terminally ill patient should take into account the views and preferences of the patient and family and the individualized goals of care. (See <a href=\"#H691583195\" class=\"local\">'Approach to medical decision making'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When a patient voluntarily stops eating and drinking or artificial nutrition and hydration are withdrawn, clinicians should be attentive to comfort. Many terminally ill patients or families decline nutritional intervention and rehydration when the benefits and risks are thoroughly and respectfully explained. (See <a href=\"#H549792393\" class=\"local\">'Practical strategies for managing patients who have stopped nutrition and hydration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If a patient at the end of life or his or her family requests a trial of rehydration after artificial hydration is withdrawn, it should be provided, so long as they recognize that symptoms may not respond to fluids and that hydration is associated with certain risks (eg, peripheral or pulmonary edema). If symptoms do not respond to this trial, rehydration should be discontinued.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The issues are more complex in patients undergoing VSED who become delirious and repeatedly request to drink despite their earlier decisions to forego food and fluids. (See <a href=\"#H2346126173\" class=\"local\">'Patients who have chosen VSED'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Families who consider nutrition and hydration to have symbolic value that extends beyond the bounds of medical care should have their point of view respected so long as it does not conflict with the patient&rsquo;s previously expressed wishes. (See <a href=\"#H549792393\" class=\"local\">'Practical strategies for managing patients who have stopped nutrition and hydration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4637953\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The author is employed by the National Institutes of Health Department of Bioethics.
