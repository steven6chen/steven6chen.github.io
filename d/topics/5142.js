The diagnosis of SSc and related disorders is based primarily upon the presence of characteristic clinical findings, and supported by specific serologic abnormalities. The various cutaneous and visceral manifestations of SSc are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>SSc is a heterogenous disease, but two distinct clinical subsets are traditionally recognized based on the extent of skin involvement: limited cutaneous SSc (lcSSc) and diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc). Patients with lcSSc typically have skin involvement distal to the elbows and knees, and may display features of the CREST syndrome (<strong>C</strong>alcinosis cutis, <strong>R</strong>aynaud phenomenon, <strong>E</strong>sophageal dysmotility, <strong>S</strong>clerodactyly, and <strong>T</strong>elangiectasia). Patients with dcSSc generally have skin involvement extending to the proximal limbs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> trunk. The classification of scleroderma disorders is discussed in detail separately.

Several classification systems for SSc have been developed for research purposes. Although the items generally included in classification criteria reflect those used for the clinical diagnosis, there are other findings used in clinical practice that inform the diagnosis. Rare patients who do not fulfill the classification criteria may be diagnosed with SSc, and, conversely, other patients who do fulfill the criteria may still have an alternative diagnosis. Limitations in previous classification criteria prompted a major international effort to develop newer systems that better reflect advances in assessment and understanding of the disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H283480108\"><span class=\"h3\">2013 Classification criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The 2013 Classification Criteria for Systemic Sclerosis were developed by a joint committee of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) to identify patients with SSc for inclusion in clinical studies, and to be more sensitive and specific than previous criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F91166%7ERHEUM%2F91165\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91166 graphicRef91165 \">table 3A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. This system addressed some of the shortcomings of previously used classification systems by capturing a broader spectrum of SSc patients, and also incorporated several diagnostic advances, particularly specific autoantibodies and nailfold capillaroscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/10,22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,22-25</a>].</p><p>The 2013 criteria incorporate disease manifestations of the three hallmarks of SSc: fibrosis of the skin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> internal organs, production of specific autoantibodies, and evidence of vasculopathy. Skin thickening of the fingers extending proximal to the metacarpophalangeal joints is sufficient for the patient to be classified as having SSc. If that is not present, seven additive items with varying weights for each should be used: skin thickening of the fingers, fingertip lesions, telangiectasia, abnormal nailfold capillaries, ILD or pulmonary arterial hypertension, RP, and SSc-related autoantibodies.</p><p>The 2013 criteria performed much better in correctly classifying SSc patients among a validation sample of 268 patients with SSc and 137 control individuals than the 1980 and 2001 criteria. The sensitivity and specificity for the 2013 criteria were 0.91 and 0.92, respectively. By comparison, the sensitivity and specificity were 0.75 and 0.72 for the 1980 criteria and 0.75 and 0.78 for the 2001 criteria, respectively. The 2013 criteria have yet to be validated in ethnic groups that are not common in North America and in Europe.</p><p>It must be noted that strict adherence to these criteria will still exclude some patients in whom a clinical diagnosis of SSc would likely be made.

Key features (or &quot;red flags&quot;) that should raise suspicion for early SSc include RP, puffy swollen digits, and the presence of a positive ANA. The prevalence of these proposed diagnostic features was evaluated in a cohort of 469 patients with RP. Almost 90 percent of ANA-positive patients with RP and puffy swollen digits also had scleroderma-specific autoantibodies <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a scleroderma pattern on nailfold capillaroscopy, and fulfilled the preliminary criteria for early SSc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Validation of the predictive value of these preliminary criteria is still needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of systemic sclerosis (SSc) is related to the predominant clinical features of the particular patient. In some cases, the differential includes conditions with scleroderma-like skin changes, whereas in others, the differential of Raynaud phenomenon (RP) or interstitial lung disease (ILD) or pulmonary hypertension may need to be considered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Causes of scleroderma-like skin changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Indurated skin (scleroderma) may be a manifestation of conditions other than SSc. Indurated skin may result from exposures to drugs, toxins, or harmful environmental factors. Some endocrine disorders (eg, diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism), renal disease, and infiltrative disorders can also cause scleroderma-like skin changes.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Scleredema &ndash; Scleredema is characterized by prominent symmetrical skin thickening predominantly on the trunk, particularly the shoulders and upper back. The face may also be affected, while the fingers are spared. In severe cases, mobility of the shoulders and chest is markedly impaired. Patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus may develop a type of scleredema called scleredema of Buschke (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cutaneous-manifestations-of-internal-malignancy#H28414868\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cutaneous manifestations of internal malignancy&quot;, section on 'Scleredema'</a>). RP, nailfold microvascular changes, and autoantibodies are not present in these patients, and ILD and other forms of internal organ involvement are rare.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Scleromyxedema &ndash; Scleromyxedema (papular mucinosis) is characterized by waxy, yellow-red papules on the head, neck, arms, and upper trunk, commonly occurring over thickened and indurated skin. Middle-aged adults are most commonly affected. The presence of a monoclonal protein, often IgG lambda, detected by immunofixation on samples of serum <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> urine supports the diagnosis of scleromyxedema. Skin biopsy is frequently diagnostic. Scleromyxedema may be associated with, and be the presenting features of, immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis and multiple myeloma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cutaneous-manifestations-of-internal-malignancy#H28414818\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cutaneous manifestations of internal malignancy&quot;, section on 'Scleromyxedema'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overlap syndromes &ndash; Typical scleroderma skin changes occur in some patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), inflammatory arthritis, and inflammatory muscle diseases. An &quot;overlap syndrome&quot; is present if there is clear-cut SSc together with sufficient clinical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> laboratory features to support a concurrent diagnosis of another defined connective tissue disease. In some cases, a diagnosis of mixed connective tissue disease is made, but this may reflect a temporary state. Many patients who are given the diagnosis of mixed connective tissue disease 'differentiate' over time by evolving into SSc, SLE, or dermatomyositis, while some retain features of multiple diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=undifferentiated-systemic-rheumatic-connective-tissue-diseases-and-overlap-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Undifferentiated systemic rheumatic (connective tissue) diseases and overlap syndromes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-diagnosis-of-mixed-connective-tissue-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and diagnosis of mixed connective tissue disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endocrine disorders &ndash; Diabetes mellitus and myxedema due to hypothyroidism can be accompanied by skin induration. Endocrine disorders may also occur in some patients with monoclonal gammopathies, for example, in the POEMS syndrome (<strong>P</strong>olyneuropathy, <strong>O</strong>rganomegaly, <strong>E</strong>ndocrinopathy, <strong>M</strong>onoclonal gammopathy, and <strong>S</strong>kin changes). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=poems-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;POEMS syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Sclerodactyly due to diabetes mellitus (&quot;diabetic cheiroarthropathy&quot;) occurs in individuals with longstanding Type I diabetes. It is characterized by thickening and waxiness of the skin, mostly marked on the dorsa of the fingers. Diabetic cheiroarthropathy is often associated with limited joint mobility and flexion contractures of the proximal interphalangeal joints. RP, ischemic ulceration, calcinosis cutis, and tapering of the digits are absent, and autoantibodies are not detected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=musculoskeletal-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Musculoskeletal complications in diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Diabetic sclerodactyly'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Myxedema is seen in hypothyroidism and is characterized by thickening and coarseness of the skin (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism&quot;, section on 'Skin'</a>). The increased incidence of hypothyroidism in SSc complicates the differential diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis &ndash; Among patients with advanced renal failure (dialysis-dependent or estimated glomerular filtration rate of less than 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min),</span> the administration of gadolinium containing contrast media for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been associated with nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (previously called nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy). Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis is characterized by thickening and hardening of the skin overlying the extremities and trunk. On histologic examination, there is marked expansion and fibrosis of the dermis with accumulation of CD34-positive fibroblasts. The clinical appearance of the affected limbs resembles eosinophilic fasciitis, but is distinguished by involvement of hands and feet, which are typically spared in eosinophilic fasciitis. Internal organ fibrosis may also occur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nephrogenic-systemic-fibrosis-nephrogenic-fibrosing-dermopathy-in-advanced-renal-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis/nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy in advanced renal failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amyloidosis &ndash; Amyloid infiltration of the skin may produce thickening and stiffness. This is characteristic of AL amyloid, due to a plasma cell disorder. Skin biopsy reveals accumulation of amyloid with characteristic staining properties, and polarizing microscopic examination of Congo red-stained skin or subcutaneous fat reveals apple-green birefringence. Immunofixation of serum or urine reveals a monoclonal component. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-amyloidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of amyloidosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eosinophilic fasciitis &ndash; Eosinophilic fasciitis (diffuse fasciitis with eosinophilia) leads to adherence of skin to underlying thickened fascia. Skin changes are prominent proximal to the wrists and ankles and usually spare the hands and feet. The disorder is associated with transient peripheral blood eosinophilia and a variable degree of inflammatory cell infiltration in the fascia. Skin changes suggestive of eosinophilic fasciitis are an orange peel (peau d'orange) appearance and the groove sign (visible collapse of the superficial veins when the limb is elevated). In order to observe the characteristic changes in the fascia, a surgical excisional biopsy of skin, including subcutaneous tissue and fascia, is necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eosinophilic-fasciitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eosinophilic fasciitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic graft-versus-host disease &ndash; Both localized and generalized scleroderma-like skin changes can occur in chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). This disorder typically follows allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation but may also occur following transfusions in immunosuppressed hosts. Autoantibodies, particularly antinucleolar and antimitochondrial antibodies, may be present. RP is generally absent. Characteristic findings on skin biopsy may help in differentiating chronic GVHD from scleroderma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-grading-of-chronic-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and grading of chronic graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drug-induced scleroderma &ndash; Use of some drugs has been linked to the development of scleroderma or scleroderma-like disorders.

Exposures to organic solvents, petroleum distillates, a contaminant of L-tryptophan, and adulterated cooking oil have also been related to diseases with scleroderma-like skin thickening. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for and possible causes of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma)&quot;, section on 'Noninfectious environmental factors'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Raynaud phenomenon</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RP occurs in over 90 percent of patients with SSc but does not occur in the other disorders associated with scleroderma-like skin changes discussed above (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Causes of scleroderma-like skin changes'</a> above). On the other hand, cold-induced digital vasospasm associated with characteristic color changes may occur in isolation (primary RP, also called Raynaud disease), in other disease states, and in response to drugs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> environmental exposures (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-raynaud-phenomenon\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the Raynaud phenomenon&quot;</a>). Primary RP occurs in up to 5 percent of the general population and more commonly in women; in these individuals, it generally develops in the first three decades of life, is frequently familial, and is not associated with ischemic digital ulcers or infarction.</p><p>RP is not a feature of localized forms of scleroderma.
