Standard approaches to ADT include bilateral orchiectomy or medical orchiectomy using a gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist, which may be given alone or in combination with an antiandrogen (combined androgen blockade). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-systemic-therapy-for-castration-sensitive-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial systemic therapy for castration-sensitive prostate cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Despite initial response rates of 80 to 90 percent, nearly all men eventually develop progressive disease following ADT; this is referred to as castration-resistant prostate cancer. Contemporary research in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer has led to the development of multiple agents that improved overall survival in phase III trials (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F85716\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85716 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Insights into the mechanisms by which androgens stimulate growth of prostate cancer cells is leading to the development of new treatments with clinically significant activity in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer.

In addition to androgen production by the adrenal gland and testis, several of the enzymes involved in the synthesis of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, including cytochrome P450 17-alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (CYP17), are highly expressed in tumor tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/castration-resistant-prostate-cancer-treatments-targeting-the-androgen-pathway/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Collectively, these findings changed the perspective on prostate cancer from what has long been considered an &quot;endocrine&quot; disease to one that is dependent on <span class=\"nowrap\">&quot;autocrine/paracrine&quot;</span> signaling for tumor progression and survival. This understanding has led to the development of drugs that act by inhibiting the enzymes responsible for androgen production, as well as agents that inhibit the androgen receptor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1409964\"><span class=\"h3\">Androgen synthesis inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=abiraterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Abiraterone</a> was developed through screening chemical derivatives of a parent structure of pregnenolone. The structural changes in abiraterone cause potent and irreversible inhibition of CYP17 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/castration-resistant-prostate-cancer-treatments-targeting-the-androgen-pathway/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. In preclinical studies, abiraterone was 10 times more potent than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketoconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketoconazole</a> as an inhibitor of CYP17 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/castration-resistant-prostate-cancer-treatments-targeting-the-androgen-pathway/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1409980\" class=\"local\">'Abiraterone'</a> below.)</p><p>Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketoconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketoconazole</a> is a more potent inhibitor of the side chain cleavage enzyme, which plays a critical role in adrenal steroidogenesis, patients treated with either of these agents are at risk for adrenal insufficiency and require steroid replacement therapy. The use of ketoconazole is further limited by the potential for drug-drug interactions, particularly with statins and antidepressants. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alternative-endocrine-therapies-for-castration-resistant-prostate-cancer#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Alternative endocrine therapies for castration-resistant prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Ketoconazole'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1385299623\"><span class=\"h3\">Androgen receptor antagonists</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some metastatic and primary prostate tumors retain activation of the androgen receptor in processes that are entirely independent of the androgen ligand. Several mechanisms, including up-regulation of androgen receptor expression through amplification of the androgen receptor gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/castration-resistant-prostate-cancer-treatments-targeting-the-androgen-pathway/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>], increased sensitivity of the androgen receptor via overexpression of nuclear coactivators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/castration-resistant-prostate-cancer-treatments-targeting-the-androgen-pathway/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and splice variant mutations of the receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/castration-resistant-prostate-cancer-treatments-targeting-the-androgen-pathway/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>], have been proposed and may coexist. Importantly, these data suggest that progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer in some patients may not be effectively treated by a focus solely on ligand-directed therapy.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=enzalutamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Enzalutamide</a>, a small molecule antagonist of the androgen receptor, has important clinical activity and a role in the management of patients with castration-resistant disease. (See <a href=\"#H1385299855\" class=\"local\">'Enzalutamide'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H617152555\"><span class=\"h2\">Resistance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although both androgen synthesis inhibitors and androgen receptor antagonists can significantly alter the natural history of castration-resistant prostate cancer, progressive disease and resistance to these agents will eventually develop in most cases. The mechanisms for resistance are not fully understood and are the subject of ongoing research.</p><p>One possible mechanism to explain the lack of activity of these agents in approximately one-third of patients and the presence of resistance in almost all of those who do respond is the presence of variants in the androgen receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/castration-resistant-prostate-cancer-treatments-targeting-the-androgen-pathway/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. The androgen receptor isoform splice variant 7 (AR-V7) lacks the binding site for androgen while retaining the activating site that stimulates tumor growth.</p><p>The most extensive data on the importance of the AR-V7 come from a single-institution study of 202 men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who were starting therapy with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enzalutamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enzalutamide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abiraterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abiraterone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/castration-resistant-prostate-cancer-treatments-targeting-the-androgen-pathway/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. All patients were assessed for the presence or absence of circulating tumor cells (CTCs), and those with CTCs present were assessed for the presence or absence of AR-V7 in those cells. </p><p>Responses to hormonal therapy were observed in 40 of 53 (75 percent) of those patients without CTCs, 59 of 113 (52 percent) of those with CTCs but without AR-V7, and 5 of 36 (14 percent) of those with CTCs that contained AR-V7. Furthermore, the duration of progression-free survival for these groups decreased with the presence of AR-V7 (11.3, 6.2, and 2.1 months for the three groups, respectively). Overall survival was significantly shorter for those with AR-V7 (28.7, 29.5, and 11.2 months, respectively).</p><p>Although the AR-V7 splice variant predicts resistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enzalutamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enzalutamide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abiraterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abiraterone</a>, preliminary evidence suggests that it is not associated with resistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docetaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docetaxel</a> chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/castration-resistant-prostate-cancer-treatments-targeting-the-androgen-pathway/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Although a standard validated assay methodology has not been developed, nor is one widely available at this point, one is expected. The optimal use of AR-V7 testing is likely to be in the abiraterone- or enzalutamide-resistant setting, in which consideration is being given to the use of a second androgen receptor-targeted drug versus proceeding with chemotherapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1409980\"><span class=\"h1\">ABIRATERONE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=abiraterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Abiraterone</a> is an orally administered small molecule that irreversibly inhibits the products of the cytochrome P450 17-alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (<em>CYP17</em>) gene (including both 17,20-lyase and 17-alpha-hydroxylase).

CYP17, the target of abiraterone, regulates the conversion of pregnenolone and related steroids into androgens and is relatively specific for androgen production. However, there is inhibition of 17-alpha hydroxylase with decreased cortisol and a compensatory rise in adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which is mediated by a hypothalamic response to partial adrenal inhibition.</p><p>The increased ACTH release can cause increased adrenal mineralocorticoid production, which can lead to hypertension and hypokalemia. When <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abiraterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abiraterone</a> is given without concomitant glucocorticoids, patients typically do not experience clinical adrenal insufficiency since cortisol production is preserved. The effects of mineralocorticoid excess can be attenuated by coadministration with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, which reduces ACTH-mediated stimulation of the adrenal glands.</p><p>In the phase III trial in men who had received prior <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docetaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docetaxel</a>, the incidence of severe (grade 3 or 4) adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment was similar in those treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abiraterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abiraterone</a> and placebo (10 and 13 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/castration-resistant-prostate-cancer-treatments-targeting-the-androgen-pathway/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Side effects that were more common with abiraterone included fluid retention and hypokalemia (33 versus 24, and 18 versus 9 percent, respectively). Nonspecific cardiac abnormalities, abnormal liver function tests, and hypertension may also be more common in patients treated with abiraterone (16 versus 12, 11 versus 9, and 11 versus 8 percent, respectively).</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=abiraterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Abiraterone</a> should be administered with 10 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> daily, although the safety of lower doses of prednisone during long-term therapy is under investigation. Monthly potassium and blood pressure monitoring are essential to the proper management of patients on abiraterone. Because the hypertension is mediated by an excess of mineralocorticoids, specific mineralocorticoid antagonists, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eplerenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eplerenone</a>, may be useful; however, standard antihypertensive therapies are also of benefit.</p><p>Side effects attributable to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> are limited.
