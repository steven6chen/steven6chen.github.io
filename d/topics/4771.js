Cystine stones are found in 1 to 2 percent of stone formers, although they represent a higher percentage of stones in children (approximately 5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Cystinuria is a subject of study of the <a href=\"http://www.rarekidneystones.org/&amp;token=3P39bFY6QkFxXEfCK67hxqSjWs8veZQApZ5sRjw5GseLKpoecAxO8PWh+qN4i5Ly&amp;TOPIC_ID=7362\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Rare Kidney Stone Consortium</a>, an organization funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) with international collaboration focused upon research and education aimed at improving care for these patients.</p><p>Cystinuria is a different disorder from cystinosis, which is characterized by intracellular cystine accumulation leading to the Fanconi syndrome and progressive renal failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystinosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystinosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H178545215\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS, GENETICS, AND CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cystine is a homodimer of the amino acid cysteine. Patients with cystinuria have impairment of renal cystine transport, with decreased proximal tubular reabsorption of filtered cystine resulting in increased urinary cystine excretion and cystine nephrolithiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. The cystine transporter also promotes the reabsorption of dibasic amino acids, including ornithine, arginine, and lysine, but these compounds are soluble so that an increase in their urinary excretion does not lead to stones. Intestinal cystine transport is also diminished, but the result is of uncertain clinical significance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H346007738\"><span class=\"h2\">Classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Previously, cystinuria was classified according to the amount of cystine excreted by the parents of the affected child. In that phenotypic classification system, patients were classified as type I if their parents excreted normal amounts of cystine and types II or III if parental cystine excretion was either greatly (II) or moderately (III) increased. However, with the identification of the genes responsible for this disorder (specifically, <em>SLC3A1</em> and <em>SLC7A9</em>), a genotypic classification of cystinuria was introduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. Neither the genotypic nor the phenotypic classification appears to be relevant with respect to the clinical course in patients with cystinuria, as is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Genotype-phenotype correlation with stone risk'</a> below.)</p><p>Almost all cases of cystinuria are accounted for by mutations in two genes. The protein products of the two genes associate with each other in the apical membrane of the proximal tubule and in the intestine. The genotypic classification scheme, based upon which gene is affected, is summarized here:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Defects in <em>SLC3A1</em> &minus; This gene encodes rBAT, a protein required for normal trafficking of the amino acid transporter to its appropriate location in the apical membrane of affected epithelia. While this protein is not itself a solute carrier, when mutated, its failure to move the amino acid transporter to the correct locations leads to impairment of cystine and dibasic amino acid transport. Patients who are homozygous for this mutation are referred to as having <strong>type A</strong> cystinuria. In most cases, patients with type A cystinuria also have what was previously called the type I phenotype, meaning that their parents have normal cystine excretion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Defects in <em>SLC7A9</em> &minus; This gene encodes an amino acid transporter, b<sup>0,+</sup>AT. When this protein is defective, its appearance at the apical membrane, assuming rBAT is normal, does not lead to normal amino acid reabsorption. Homozygotes are classified as having <strong>type B</strong> cystinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In most cases, patients with type B cystinuria have parents with elevated levels of urinary cystine (but who rarely have stones). These patients were previously called type II or type III cystinuria in the older classification; together these two phenotypes were also known as &quot;nontype I.&quot; The genetic basis for separating the previous type II and type III patients is not apparent. Since the parents of patients with type B cystinuria have increased levels of cystine excretion, this genotype should be considered an autosomal dominant disorder with incomplete penetrance for nephrolithiasis. Heterozygotes may sometimes form stones if urine volume is low or if animal protein intake is high.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H178545747\"><span class=\"h2\">SLC3A1 defects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>SLC3A1</em> is located on chromosome 2p16.3-p21 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>] and encodes a glycoprotein, rBAT, which forms a heterodimer with the gene product of <em>SLC7A9</em>. The heterodimer mediates sodium-independent transport of cystine and dibasic acids (ornithine, arginine, and lysine) in the apical membrane of the proximal tubule and small intestine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. rBAT is the heavy chain subunit of the dimer and appears to target the transporter to the brush border membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The severity of the defect in protein function, and therefore in cystine handling, varies, in part, with the type of mutation that is present (point mutation, gene deletion, etc) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Most known mutations result in abnormalities of heterodimer folding or trafficking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The majority of patients with what was previously classified as the type I phenotype have inherited mutations in both alleles of the <em>SLC3A1</em> gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], and a large number of different mutations in this gene have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. The correlation between <em>SLC3A1</em> and the type 1 phenotype of cystinuria was illustrated in a study of 164 probands from the International Cystinuria Consortium, of whom 97 were typed by urine excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 37 patients who had the type I phenotype, 34 carried at least one <em>SLC3A1</em> mutation, and 29 had two mutated <em>SLC3A1</em> alleles (genotype AA).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A rare, in-frame duplication of <em>SLC3A1</em> was associated with nontype I cystinuria. However, with this solitary exception, all patients with cystinuria who had <em>SLC3A1</em> mutations displayed the type I phenotype.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H178545754\"><span class=\"h2\">SLC7A9 defects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <em>SLC7A9</em> gene is located on chromosome 19q12-13.1 and encodes b<sup>0,+</sup>AT, the amino acid transporting subunit of the heteromeric complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/9,12,18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,12,18-20</a>]. Many disease-causing mutations have been reported in this gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/1,17,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,17,21</a>].</p><p>Most patients with the type B genotype for cystinuria have inherited defects in both alleles of this gene accounting for the phenotypes previously called type II and III, or nontype 1. However, patients with mutations in <em>SLC7A9</em> can also have the type I phenotype or a mixed-type phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. The following studies illustrate the range of findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 43 nontype I probands, 41 had mutations in <em>SLC7A9</em>, and 34 had two mutated <em>SLC7A9</em> alleles (genotype BB) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Mixed-type probands (n = 14), who had only one parent with elevated cystine excretion, carried mutations in either <em>SLC7A9</em> or <em>SLC3A1</em>, with two <em>SLC7A9</em> abnormalities being the most representative genotype.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study examining genotype-phenotype correlations found that the same mutation in the <em>SLC7A9</em> gene was responsible for both type II and type III phenotype in four different patients, and two different missense mutations in the <em>SLC7A9</em> gene were linked to type I phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H211342984\"><span class=\"h2\">Mixed heterozygotes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People who are heterozygotes for mutations in both <em>SLC3A1</em> and <em>SLC7A9</em> do not usually form cystine stones. Patients may have inherited mutations in both genes, but they will only form stones if they have mutations in both copies of at least one of these genes. However, some studies suggest that mutations in a single allele of either <em>SLC3A1</em> or <em>SLC7A9</em> may lead to cystine stone formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H178546152\"><span class=\"h2\">Other genetic defects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Known defects in <em>SLC3A1</em> and <em>SLC7A9</em> do <strong>not</strong> explain all cases of cystinuria (all but 9 percent of patients in one study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], suggesting other, as yet, unidentified genetic defects may contribute. However, investigations using a candidate-gene approach have not yet been successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Very rarely, cystine stone formation can occur in patients who have only one mutant <em>SLC3A1</em> allele when another gene, called prolyl endopeptidase-like (<em>PREPL</em>), is also defective:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with the hypotonia-cystinuria syndrome have one mutant <em>SLC3A1</em> allele and mutation in a second gene called <em>PREPL</em>.

However, patients with cystinuria may present with their first stone at older ages. The median age of onset of stones was 12 years in a cohort of over 200 patients, but onset of stone formation may also occur in infancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] and even late adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/17,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,24</a>], highlighting the need for stone analysis in all adults presenting with nephrolithiasis. For unclear reasons, in some studies, males appear to be more severely affected than females. Cystinuria should also be suspected in patients with large branched (staghorn) calculi, filling the collecting system and requiring surgical management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/17,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,25</a>].

In one study, for example, 16 of 76 cystine stone formers had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup> (21 percent), including three patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or a renal transplant; reduced eGFR was more common among patients who had staghorn calculi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Similar findings were seen in a French cohort of 314 patients above the age of 16 years, among whom 84 had chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 3, 4, or 5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In addition, 88 patients had hypertension, which was significantly associated with risk for CKD. The higher CKD risk is possibly related to the need for multiple urological procedures to remove stones beginning at a young age. Such procedures, including shock wave lithotripsy, have been associated with decreased kidney function. Alternative hypotheses suggest that the lower eGFR in these patients may be due to intratubular obstruction by cystine crystals. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-complications-of-extracorporeal-shock-wave-lithotripsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal complications of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Renal pathology'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Genotype-phenotype correlation with stone risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although data are conflicting, the clinical manifestations of type A and B cystinuria appear to be similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/6,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,15</a>], and different genotypes do not reliably predict the clinical severity of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Of note, not all individuals with genotypically proven cystinuria develop stones, indicating that other factors, perhaps environmental or related to risk-modifying genes, may contribute to the risk for stone formation in these patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H193492902\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiologic imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with other types of stones, cystine stones are well visualized with noncontrast computed tomography (CT).

Urinary cystine excretion should be quantified in a 24-hour urine collection; however, in younger children, a 24-hour urine collection may not be practical, in which case a spot urine cystine-to-creatinine ratio can be performed as an alternative.

The degree of supersaturation may be expressed as the ratio between the actual concentration and the solubility limit, as shown here:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Measured cystine concentration<br/> &#160;Supersaturation of cystine &#160;= &#160;-------------------------------------------<br/> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Estimated cystine solubility</p></div></div><p>Cystine crystals will dissolve when the supersaturation is below 1, while values above 1 are associated with an increased likelihood of stone formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Although the ideal saturation level has not been defined, we aim for a supersaturation level of 0.6 in a 24-hour urine specimen. This allows for variation in saturation over the course of the day, including the inevitable increase in supersaturation overnight when urine volume drops [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Achieving this degree of reduction in cystine supersaturation can prevent new stone formation and cause dissolution of preexisting stones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/3,35,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,35,39,40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6937161\"><span class=\"h2\">General approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two main approaches for reducing the urinary supersaturation of cystine include conservative measures, which should be prescribed to all affected patients, and thiol-containing drugs. A trial of conservative measures is usually pursued before thiol-containing drugs are prescribed, unless the urine cystine concentration is sufficiently high that conservative measures are not likely to lower the supersaturation of cystine to below 1. These issues are discussed in detail in the following sections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial therapy with conservative measures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is possible to reduce the supersaturation of cystine by increasing fluid intake (which decreases the cystine concentration), by restricting sodium and protein intake (which reduces cystine excretion and, therefore, cystine concentration), and by urinary alkalinization (which increases the solubility of cystine). These three conservative measures are complementary and should be attempted in all patients with cystinuria.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">High fluid intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Knowledge of the rate of cystine excretion can be used to estimate the optimal urine output to achieve a urine cystine concentration of less than 243 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. If, for example, cystine excretion is 750 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (3.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/day),</span> then a urine output of at least 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/day</span> will be needed to keep the urine cystine supersaturation less than 1 at a urine pH above 7. A higher volume is advisable to keep supersaturation low throughout the day. (See <a href=\"#H252939269\" class=\"local\">'Urinary cystine excretion'</a> above.)</p><p>The patient should be provided with specific instructions regarding fluid intake and daily urine output goals and instructed to drink at night as well as during the day to achieve this goal since high urine outputs during the day may not prevent stone formation if volume drops and supersaturation increases markedly overnight. No specific fluids are prohibited, though limiting soda beverages to one can per day may be judicious as they contain little potential base and undesirable caloric loads.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H252939369\"><span class=\"h3\">Sodium and protein restriction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with cystinuria should be advised to moderately restrict sodium to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/day</span>. We also suggest a moderate protein intake (0.8 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day) as this provides adequate nutrition and should be tolerated by most patients.</p><p>Short-term studies have demonstrated reductions in cystine excretion with sodium restriction, although the mechanism by which this occurs is incompletely understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>], since the cystine transporter is not sodium dependent. Animal protein restriction also decreases cystine excretion, probably by decreasing the intake of methionine, the precursor of cystine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In addition, limiting animal protein intake may aid urinary alkalinization, which increases the solubility of cystine. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Urinary alkalinization'</a> below.)</p><p>Lowering sodium intake to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/day</span> can markedly reduce cystine excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>], but adherence to such a diet is difficult. Since there is a linear relationship between sodium and cystine excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], a dietary sodium intake of 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/day</span> is more reasonable and achievable by most people avoiding processed foods.</p><p>There are no long-term studies demonstrating a benefit from moderate sodium and protein restriction on prevention of cystine stones. However, the risks of moderate sodium and protein restriction are few, and the efficacy of these interventions on cystine excretion in a given patient can be easily assessed with 24-hour urine studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Urinary alkalinization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cystine solubility increases by up to threefold in an alkaline urine but only if the urine pH is greater than 7 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This degree of urinary alkalinization may require up to 3 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/kg</span> per day of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-citrate-tablet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium citrate</a> or potassium bicarbonate, taken in three or four divided doses as needed to achieve round-the-clock alkalinization. We begin with doses of 20 mEq three times daily and adjust based upon the urine pH. We recommend patients to perform home urine pH testing; testing once per day, at various times, for one month can provide a good sense of whether round-the-clock alkalinization is being achieved. Inexpensive urine pH testing paper can be purchased via the internet, avoiding the more expensive test strips used in clinical laboratories. To maintain an alkaline urine pH overnight, the last dose of potassium citrate or potassium bicarbonate should be taken at bedtime.</p><p>In selected cases, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetazolamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetazolamide</a>, which can increase urine pH by causing bicarbonaturia, has been used as an adjunct therapy to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-citrate-tablet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium citrate</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. However, we do not recommend this option, as the chronic metabolic acidosis induced by such carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may adversely affect bone mineral density, cause hypocitraturia, and increase the risk of developing calcium phosphate stones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].</p><p>Sodium citrate or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> should be avoided since the sodium load can enhance calcium and cystine excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. However, sodium salts may be appropriate if hyperkalemia prevents use of potassium. Raising the urine pH lowers the solubility of calcium phosphate, increasing the risk of forming calcium phosphate stones. However, this effect is mitigated by increased urine citrate excretion and higher urine volumes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-recurrent-calcium-stones-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of recurrent calcium stones in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Adherence with alkali therapy may be difficult since both alkali and water loading can lead to abdominal bloating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients who fail or are likely to be resistant to conservative therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cystine is the homodimer formed from the linkage of two cysteine molecules by a disulfide bond. Thiol-containing drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tiopronin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tiopronin</a>, D-penicillamine) have sulfhydryl groups that can reduce this disulfide bond, producing mixed drug-cysteine disulfides that are more soluble than the homodimer cystine.</p><p>A thiol-containing drug may be used in conjunction with conservative measures if, after a three-month trial, these measures are ineffective or are limited by inadequate compliance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Failure of conservative measures is defined by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Failure to lower the urine cystine concentration to below 243 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> and to raise the urine pH to above 7 in a 24-hour urine (or, if the measurement is available, failure to lower the urinary supersaturation of cystine to below 1)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistence of cystine crystals visualized by urinalysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F56834\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56834 \">picture 1</a>), indicating that the urine is supersaturated with cystine</p><p/><p>A thiol-containing drug may also be used with conservative measures as first-line therapy in patients who have a urinary cystine excretion that is so high that conservative measures are unlikely to be sufficient. As an example, a patient who excretes 1000 mg of cystine per day would require more than 4 liters of urine output per day to achieve a urine cystine concentration below 243 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span>. This degree of urine output is unrealistic in most patients, and, thus, a thiol-containing drug could be used as first-line therapy, particularly in patients with a history of larger stones or more urologic interventions. These agents are always used in <strong>conjunction</strong> with fluid and alkali therapy (not as sole therapy). In addition, the ability of thiol drugs to quickly solubilize cystine may be greater in alkaline as compared with acidic urine, highlighting the need for combination therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>In patients who require a thiol-containing drug, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tiopronin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tiopronin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillamine</a> are similarly efficacious in reducing cystine excretion and stone recurrences. We prefer to use tiopronin as the first-line thiol drug given its lower incidence of adverse effects. In patients who cannot tolerate either tiopronin or D-penicillamine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=captopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">captopril</a> is an option, but it is less effective in reducing urine cystine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2872941056\"><span class=\"h3\">Tiopronin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tiopronin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tiopronin</a> (2-mercaptopropionylglycine) forms a soluble tiopronin-cysteine complex. In uncontrolled trials, tiopronin was similar in efficacy to D-penicillamine. Tiopronin reduces cystine excretion and stone recurrences in up to 70 percent of patients at doses of 400 to 1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> in three divided doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/42,48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,48,49</a>].

However, we prefer tiopronin as the first-line thiol drug because the incidence of these side effects is lower than with D-penicillamine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/3,17,51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,17,51-53</a>]. In our experience, patients who have been unable to tolerate D-penicillamine may be able to take tiopronin, and it can be used as a long-term preventive therapy if well tolerated.</p><p>The incidence of side effects may be minimized by starting with lower doses (ie, 200 to 300 mg three times per day) and gradually increasing the dose, a strategy that has been successfully implemented in children with cystinuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Optimal monitoring strategies for adverse effects are not well defined.

The number of stone episodes fell from 0.93 to 0.20 per patient per year during treatment, and fewer urological procedures were required.

Optimally, the supersaturation of cystine, as well as calcium phosphate and calcium oxalate, should be measured in order to determine the risk of stone formation. Patients treated for cystinuria may occasionally continue to form stones despite a supersaturation of cystine that is below 1 in a 24-hour urine specimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Diurnal variation in cystine excretion and urine flow may explain the nephrolithiasis in such cases. Measuring daytime and nighttime cystine excretion separately may be helpful to evaluate for transient nighttime supersaturation, which may occur despite apparently effective solubilizing therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>We initially monitor every three to six months until the patient is stable on therapy, then approximately every six months. Monitoring can probably be decreased to yearly if there has been no evidence of stone formation for several years on a constant regimen.</p><p>If thiol-containing drugs are used, it is useful to estimate the amount of cystine that is probably present as a soluble mixed disulfide and how much is present as unbound cysteine or cystine. However, measurement of urinary cystine is usually imprecise in the presence of thiol drugs. Colorimetric assays are unable to distinguish cystine from the thiol drug-bound cysteine complexes; thus, the amount of cystine reported is greater than the unbound cystine that is available for stone formation. In contrast to colorimetric assays, chromatographic methods can distinguish cystine and cysteine from thiol drug, but sample preparation may disrupt the drug-cysteine bond and give misleading results. On the other hand, urinary cystine may crystallize during the collection period, especially if urine pH is low, leading to artefactually low measured cystine levels (since the precipitated cystine might not be measured).</p><p>To address this problem and improve monitoring of therapy, an assay to quantify urinary cystine levels in the presence or absence of thiol-containing drugs has been developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/42,63,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,63,67</a>]. Known as the cystine capacity assay, it can also directly assess the level of cystine supersaturation. In addition, it can be used to assess changes in urinary cystine and cystine supersaturation in response to dietary modifications and medical therapy with thiol-containing drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/33,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,68</a>].

An alternative cystine assay that can differentiate between cystine and drug-cysteine complexes is high-performance liquid chromatography, which is infrequently available as a commercial test.</p><p>In addition to collecting 24-hour urine specimens, urine microscopy should be regularly examined for cystine crystals, which would indicate that supersaturation is present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F56834\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56834 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H252939768\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiologic monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The preferred imaging test is noncontrast computed tomography (CT) for diagnosis in symptomatic patients because stone visualization is excellent. Follow-up in asymptomatic patients is more problematic. Renal ultrasound may serve as a useful radiation-free screening test but is insensitive for detection of smaller stones. In some cases, abdominal radiography of the kidneys, ureter, and bladder (KUB) may be useful to follow previously present radiopaque stones. No studies have assessed the ideal monitoring strategy.

Cystine stones are found in 1 to 2 percent of all stone formers and approximately 5 percent of children who form stones. Affected patients have defects in an amino acid transporter, leading to decreased reabsorption and, therefore, high urinary excretion of the relatively insoluble cystine. Cystinuria is <strong>not</strong> the same as cystinosis. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with cystinuria are typically homozygous for inactivating mutations in either <em>SLC3A1</em> or <em>SLC7A9</em>. The protein products of these two genes heterodimerize to form the amino acid transporter. Heterozygous carriers of <em>SLC3A1</em> mutations usually have normal urinary cystine concentrations; heterozygotes for <em>SLC7A9</em> have elevated urinary cystine but seldom high enough to produce nephrolithiasis. (See <a href=\"#H178545215\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis, genetics, and classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with cystinuria present with nephrolithiasis and should also be suspected in someone presenting with their first stone during childhood or adolescence. Although the median age at presentation is 12 years, stones disease may occasionally present in infancy or late adulthood. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As with other types of stones, cystine stones can be visualized with noncontrast computed tomography (CT). Although cystine stones are usually discrete, cystinuria should also be suspected in patients with large branched (staghorn) calculi. (See <a href=\"#H193492902\" class=\"local\">'Radiologic imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a patient with nephrolithiasis and suspected cystinuria, the diagnosis can be made from stone analysis, a positive family history, or identification of pathognomonic hexagonal cystine crystals on urinalysis (seen on initial urinalysis in approximately 25 percent of patients) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F56834\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56834 \">picture 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H193492926\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic confirmation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients, especially younger individuals, who do not have a stone available for analysis and in whom cystine crystals are not visualized in the urine can be screened for urine cystine using the cyanide-nitroprusside test. A positive cyanide-nitroprusside screen indicates a urinary cystine concentration &gt;75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span>. A negative test generally excludes the diagnosis of cystinuria. (See <a href=\"#H193492994\" class=\"local\">'Cyanide-nitroprusside screen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with confirmed cystine stones, urinary cystine crystals, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a positive cyanide-nitroprusside screen should have quantitative testing of urinary cystine excretion. The normal rate of cystine excretion is 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (0.13 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/day);</span> by comparison, patients with cystinuria generally excrete more than 400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> (1.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/day)</span>. (See <a href=\"#H252939269\" class=\"local\">'Urinary cystine excretion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The aim of medical therapy is to maintain the cystine concentration in the urine below its solubility level. The limit of solubility can be conservatively estimated as approximately 243 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> provided the urine pH is 7 or higher. A urine cystine concentration below this level will usually prevent cystine crystallization and may lead to dissolution of existing crystals. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In all patients with cystinuria, we recommend increased fluid intake, modest reductions in sodium and animal protein intake, and urinary alkalinization (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). It is possible to reduce the likelihood of cystine crystallization by increasing fluid intake (which decreases the cystine concentration), by restricting sodium and protein intake (which modestly reduces cystine excretion and, therefore, cystine concentration), and by urinary alkalinization (which increases the solubility of cystine). (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Initial therapy with conservative measures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If conservative measures are unable to adequately reduce the urinary cystine concentration, or stones recur, we recommend adding a thiol-containing drug, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tiopronin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tiopronin</a> or D-penicillamine (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Patients with extremely high cystine excretion rates may require such agents as part of initial therapy. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Patients who fail or are likely to be resistant to conservative therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who require a thiol-containing drug, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tiopronin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tiopronin</a> given the apparent lower incidence of side effects compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillamine</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Typically, tiopronin is given in doses of 400 to 1200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> administered in three divided doses. (See <a href=\"#H2872941056\" class=\"local\">'Tiopronin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The response to and adherence with therapy should be monitored by obtaining a 24-hour urine collection to assess the urine volume and to measure cystine, urine pH, creatinine, sodium, and calcium. In patients on thiol-binding drugs, an assay that does not disrupt the cysteine-thiol bond and reports free (unbound) cystine is required. Optimally, the supersaturation of cystine, as well as calcium phosphate and calcium oxalate, should be calculated in order to determine the risk of stone formation. We initially monitor every three to six months until the patient is stable on therapy, then approximately every 6 to 12 months. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring response to therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We monitor patients with cystinuria radiographically with a noncontrast CT or renal ultrasound annually or more frequently if symptoms develop. (See <a href=\"#H252939768\" class=\"local\">'Radiologic monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H297646794\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Elaine Worcester, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystine-stones/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Chillar&oacute;n J, Font-Llitj&oacute;s M, Fort J, et al.
