Autologous HCT uses hematopoietic progenitor cells derived from the individual with the disorder. By contrast, allogeneic HCT uses hematopoietic progenitor cells collected from someone other than the individual with the disorder. Autologous and allogeneic HCT are used increasingly to treat a variety of hematologic neoplasms, nonmalignant marrow disorders, and inborn errors of metabolism. Worldwide, there are more than 40,000 HCTs performed each year.</p><p>Coupled with the increased volume of HCT has been a steady improvement in allogeneic transplant outcomes, related largely to refinement in human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matching, improved supportive care, and advances in infectious disease therapy. As a result, there are a growing number of long-term survivors of HCT, and the transplant community has recognized the importance of providing specialized care to these individuals. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipient-in-the-immediate-post-transplant-period#H599725\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the hematopoietic cell transplant recipient in the immediate post-transplant period&quot;, section on 'Estimating mortality risk'</a>.)</p><p>The quality of life among patients who have undergone autologous HCT is generally excellent. Similarly, the majority of long-term survivors of allogeneic HCT are employed and in reasonably good health, with acceptable objective and subjective function. However, the HCT process exposes these patients to highly toxic therapy and puts them at risk for several long-term complications not routinely seen after conventional doses of chemotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiotherapy. In addition, allogeneic transplant recipients are subject to the long-term consequences of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which may require specialized care for many years, even when quiescent or resolved. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quality-of-life-following-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Quality of life following hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-grading-of-chronic-graft-versus-host-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and grading of chronic graft-versus-host disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic review will provide an overview to the care of the HCT survivor, focusing on issues that require attention at approximately one year from HCT onwards. Specific care of the early complications of transplantation, the clinical care of acute and chronic GVHD, and the long-term disease-specific follow-up are discussed elsewhere, as is a more in-depth discussion of secondary malignancies after HCT.

HCT can be broadly divided into subtypes based upon the hematopoietic cell donor, the source of hematopoietic progenitor cells, and the preparative regimen. Each of these factors influences efficacy and the short- and long-term toxicities associated with the procedure.</p><p>The hematopoietic cell donor may be (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=donor-selection-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Donor selection for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Autologous</strong> &ndash; Autologous HCT refers to when hematopoietic progenitor cells are collected from the patient prior to the administration of high-dose chemotherapy designed to target an underlying malignancy. The reinfusion of the patient's hematopoietic progenitor cells rescues the patient from long-lasting, usually irreversible, profound pancytopenia. Autologous HCT is usually not associated with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Syngeneic</strong> &ndash; Syngeneic HCT refers to the use of hematopoietic progenitor cells that come from an identical twin. Syngeneic donors offer the advantage of providing a graft that is free of tumor cells and is only associated with a minimal risk of GVHD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Allogeneic</strong> &ndash; Allogeneic HCT refers to the use of hematopoietic progenitor cells collected from a relative (which can be human leukocyte antigen [HLA]-identical, -haploidentical, or -mismatched) or an unrelated donor (volunteer or umbilical cord donor). These grafts are free of tumor, but may be associated with potentially detrimental GVHD as well as a potentially beneficial graft-versus-tumor effect. The period of pancytopenia immediately following HCT is longer than for autologous HCT, and immunosuppressive agents are commonly used for prophylaxis against and treatment of GVHD. The combination of these two factors and others results in a higher rate of complications than after autologous or syngeneic HCT, especially infectious complications.</p><p/><p>The source of the hematopoietic progenitor cells may be (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sources-of-hematopoietic-stem-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sources of hematopoietic stem cells&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Peripheral blood</strong> &ndash; Peripheral blood progenitor cells can be collected using hematopoietic growth factors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Umbilical cord blood</strong> &ndash; Unrelated umbilical cord blood can be administered in single or double units and is associated with a lower risk of GVHD than anticipated for allogeneic peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bone marrow</strong> &ndash; Bone marrow progenitor cells are harvested directly from the pelvic bones. Bone marrow recovery is slower than with peripheral blood progenitor cells, but the rate of chronic GVHD may be lower with bone marrow transplantation.</p><p/><p>Preparative regimens for HCT have been termed myeloablative, reduced intensity, and nonmyeloablative. While full agreement has not been achieved, generally accepted definitions of these three types of regimens are as follows (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparative-regimens-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preparative regimens for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Myeloablative regimens</strong> &ndash; A myeloablative regimen consists of a single agent or combination of agents, typically chemotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation therapy, expected to destroy the hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow and results in profound pancytopenia that is long-lasting, usually irreversible, and in most instances fatal, unless hematopoiesis is restored by infusion of hematopoietic stem cells. Examples include total-body irradiation (TBI) &ge;5 Gy in a single dose or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a> &gt;8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> orally.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nonmyeloablative regimens</strong> &ndash; A nonmyeloablative regimen is one that will cause minimal cytopenia (but significant lymphopenia) by itself and does not require stem cell support. Examples include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludarabine</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> with or without antithymocyte globulin or TBI &le;2 Gy with or without a purine analog. Following the administration of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells, the engrafting donor T-cells will eventually eliminate host hematopoietic cells, allowing the establishment of donor hematopoiesis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Reduced-intensity regimens</strong> &ndash; Reduced-intensity regimens are an intermediate category of preparative regimens that do not fit the definition of myeloablative or nonmyeloablative. Such regimens cause cytopenias, which may be prolonged and result in significant morbidity and mortality, and require hematopoietic stem cell support. Regimens generally considered as reduced-intensity include &le;9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a> or &le;140 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melphalan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">melphalan</a>.</p><p/><p>While it was initially postulated that long-term transplant-related toxicities would be less after reduced-intensity or nonmyeloablative HCT, the long-term follow-up of most patients undergoing these types of HCT is short, and preliminary data suggest that long-term complications may be equivalent regardless of conditioning intensity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H622013943\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF CARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) survivors are at risk of developing therapy-related complications that may present years after treatment (eg, second malignancies, cardiac disease, radiation-induced hypothyroidism). These complications have surfaced as significant causes of increased mortality, and screening for some of these entities is advised in the hope that early detection may lead to better management. As such, HCT survivors should be assessed periodically to monitor for potential complications.</p><p>Comprehensive joint consensus guidelines from the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT), the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR), and the American Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation (ASBMT) were published in 2006 and updated in 2012, and recommend appropriate screening studies to monitor for the long-term complications of HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-survivorship/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Our approach is in general agreement with these guidelines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F59471\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59471 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H622014148\"><span class=\"h2\">Individualized care plan</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individualization of care plans is crucial for HCT survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-survivorship/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Preventive health measures should be emphasized, since it is known that both cancer and HCT survivors do not have better patterns of preventive health behavior when compared with non-cancer patients despite having higher levels of engagement with healthcare providers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-survivorship/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. In addition, when compared with their siblings, long-term HCT survivors are more likely to have trouble maintaining health insurance coverage and are more likely to have chronic medical conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-survivorship/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>Long-term care provided through a multispecialty clinic that can cater to the individual needs of the long-term HCT patient is optimal. Unfortunately, this multispecialty clinic model may not be practical in centers with low HCT patient volume. In the absence of a multispecialty clinic, centers should develop a plan for screening patients for the long-term complications of transplantation based upon the individual patient history, considering factors such as (see <a href=\"#H83240218\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pretransplant chemotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiotherapy for malignancy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Donor type (autologous versus allogeneic)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transplant conditioning therapy (preparative regimen)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early complications of transplantation (acute graft-versus-host disease [GVHD], infections)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age and gender of the patient</p><p/><p>While the emergence of chronic health conditions cannot be altered with screening practices alone, it is hoped that the severity and consequences of the resulting conditions can be altered. This issue remains relevant in the long term, since over 10 percent of the two-year survivors in one report subsequently died of non-relapse-related causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-survivorship/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Despite this, it is estimated that five-year survivors of HCT may have long-term survival that approaches survival rates in age-matched populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-survivorship/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H172320119\"><span class=\"h3\">Autologous HCT survivor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Long-term toxicities of autologous HCT include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment-related <span class=\"nowrap\">myelodysplasia/secondary</span> leukemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondary solid tumors</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary toxicity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection</p><p/><p>A retrospective analysis of 309 patients who underwent autologous HCT for relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma reported that non-relapse mortality surpassed relapse as the main cause of death beginning approximately eight years post-HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-survivorship/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The most common causes of non-relapse mortality in these patients were respiratory failure (31 percent), infection (13 percent), cardiac toxicity (15 percent), and secondary malignancy (15 percent). While the overall mortality rate became closer to that of the general population as the length of time from HCT increased, it did not return to normal even after 15 years of follow-up. The most common cause of non-relapse mortality in the first two years was respiratory failure and infection. After two years, secondary malignancies accounted for the most common cause of non-relapse mortality.</p><p>The importance of nonmalignant late toxicity was demonstrated in another large retrospective analysis that reported a cumulative incidence of nonmalignant late effects of 45 percent at five years after autologous HCT, with 2.5 percent of patients having three or more late effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-survivorship/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H172320127\"><span class=\"h3\">Allogeneic HCT survivor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common long-term toxicities of allogeneic HCT include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic GVHD</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infections</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment-related <span class=\"nowrap\">myelodysplasia/secondary</span> leukemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondary solid tumors</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary toxicity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac disease</p><p/><p>A cohort analysis of 1479 patients who had survived at least two years after allogeneic HCT with a median follow-up of 9.5 years reported that relapse of the primary disease was the most common cause of death, accounting for 29 percent of all deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-survivorship/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The majority of deaths due to relapse occurred between the second and fifth year of follow-up (67 percent). The most common causes of non-relapse mortality were chronic GVHD (22 percent), late infection in the absence of chronic GVHD (11 percent), subsequent malignancy (7 percent), pulmonary complications (5 percent), cardiac toxicity (2 percent), and other treatment-related events (8 percent). Non-transplant-related causes of death were implicated in 3 percent.</p><p>Multiple nonmalignant late toxicities are common in the allogeneic HCT survivor. As an example, another large retrospective analysis reported a cumulative incidence of nonmalignant late effects of 79 percent at five years after allogeneic HCT, with 26 percent of patients having three or more late effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-survivorship/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. HCT survivors with at least three late effects were more likely to have limitations in their physical and social functioning.</p><p>Importantly, the care of a patient after allogeneic HCT differs depending upon whether the patient has evidence of chronic GVHD. Chronic GVHD and its treatment place the patient at increased risk of infectious, ocular, dermatologic, hepatic, gastrointestinal, and pulmonary complications. Such complications can still occur, but are less common in patients without GVHD.

HCT survivors are at risk for cardiovascular, respiratory, endocrine, and other systemic ailments, as well as second malignancies. These risks are described in the following sections.</p><p>In a single-institution case-control study, adult HCT survivors (median follow-up 7.1 years) had higher rates of hospitalization and all-cause mortality compared with non-HCT cancer survivors and the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-survivorship/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The nearly 1800 HCT survivors had more hospitalizations or deaths with infections, more respiratory complications, and increased risk for digestive, skin, and musculoskeletal complications compared with non-HCT cancer survivors; rates of circulatory complications and second cancers were similar.</p><p>A multicenter cohort study of nearly 1000 HCT survivors, with a median time since HCT of eight years, revealed an increased risk of frailty compared with matched siblings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-survivorship/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. These young adult survivors of HCT (mean age, 43 years) had an 8.4 percent prevalence of frailty, and were more likely to be frail than control siblings (hazard ratio 8.4, 95% CI 2.0-34.5), as assessed by three or more of the following: clinically underweight, exhaustion, low energy expenditure, slow walking speed, and muscle weakness. Frailty was associated with worse outcomes, with an all-cause mortality rate of 39 percent at 10 years, compared with 15 percent among those survivors without frailty. The prevalence of frailty among these HCT survivors approached that of the general population of older adults (estimated at 10 percent prevalence at age &ge;65).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H94492366\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiovascular disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Survivors of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) have a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease when compared with their non-transplant siblings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-survivorship/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

While it has been postulated that cardiac outcomes would be better after reduced-intensity or nonmyeloablative HCT, preliminary data suggest that long-term cardiovascular health is equivalent regardless of conditioning intensity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-survivorship/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>The rate of cardiovascular death in patients who survived at least two years following HCT at one institution was greater (adjusted incidence rate difference 3.6 per 1000 person-years, 95% CI 1.7-5.5) than in a matched non-transplant population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-survivorship/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In this study, the incidence of ischemic heart disease, cardiomyopathy, heart failure (HF), stroke, rhythm disturbance dyslipidemia, diabetes, and renal disease was also greater in transplant survivors and was not affected by whether the graft was allogeneic or autologous; hypertension was more common in allogeneic graft recipients.

A single-center retrospective study of 1885 HCT survivors followed for a median of 5.9 years reported a 10-year cumulative incidence of new-onset hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia in 22, 10, and 31 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-survivorship/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. When compared with autologous HCT, allogeneic HCT was associated with the earlier development of these risk factors and an increased likelihood of developing multiple risk factors. Other factors associated with an increased incidence of cardiac risk factors were grade II to IV acute GVHD and the use of total-body irradiation (TBI) in the preparative regimen.</p><p>Screening and counseling techniques similar to those used for other at-risk populations have been applied to HCT survivors with the goal of decreasing mortality from cardiovascular disease after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-survivorship/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Cardiac risk factors should be minimized (eg, smoking, obesity, hyperlipidemia, hypertension). Routine post-HCT care should incorporate regular measurement and control of blood pressure, nutritional counseling and obesity control, counseling for smoking cessation, and control of diabetes. Some transplant centers perform annual electrocardiography to screen for asymptomatic coronary disease and refer those with several cardiac risk factors for echocardiography or exercise stress testing.</p><p>While most cases of HF following HCT occur within the first four years, HF may present more than eight years after HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-survivorship/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Risk factors for the development of HF in long-term survivors of HCT include a history of anthracycline exposure and the presence of comorbidities such as hypertension, renal insufficiency, and chronic lung disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-survivorship/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Risk does not appear to be related to specific conditioning (preparative) regimens. The risk of anthracycline-related cardiomyopathy increases with the cumulative dose and time from exposure.

As such, a set of pulmonary function tests should be obtained two to four months after allogeneic HCT to establish a new baseline, and again at one year. Residual airflow obstruction and diminished oxygen diffusion capacity may be markers of ongoing inflammatory lung processes. Patients with abnormal findings on post-HCT pulmonary function testing should be considered for annual pulmonary function testing.

Care should be taken to limit the number of imaging studies in this population, particularly in younger individuals, given concerns about radiation exposure and the risk for second malignancies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-related-risks-of-imaging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation-related risks of imaging&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An aggressive, invasive diagnostic approach is usually justified early in the evaluation of pulmonary problems after HCT. Opportunistic infections are common and specific treatments are available, but there are no sensitive noninvasive methods to diagnose opportunistic infections, and chest radiographs may be completely normal early in the disease. Patients with dyspnea and normal chest radiographs should undergo full pulmonary function testing with arterial blood gas analysis. CT of the chest is more sensitive than the plain chest radiograph and can be used as a guide to further invasive diagnostic procedures. Documentation of a restrictive pattern on pulmonary function testing should prompt a chest CT scan to look for subtle interstitial disease. Among patients with respiratory symptoms, echocardiography should be performed in patients with normal pulmonary function tests and a normal chest CT to look for cardiac dysfunction or evidence of pulmonary hypertension.

As such, a significant percentage of HCT survivors return to their local <span class=\"nowrap\">hematologist/oncologist</span> or primary care clinician for long-term care.</p><p>Transplant survivors may have specific needs in multiple areas, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiology and vascular medicine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory medicine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nephrology</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endocrinology (including bone and <span class=\"nowrap\">sexual/reproductive</span> health)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral medicine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ophthalmology</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dermatology</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infectious disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nutrition</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise physiology</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognitive and psychosocial health</p><p/><p>Guidelines have been established for appropriate screening studies to monitor for long-term complications of HCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-survivorship/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>], but these guidelines and long-term problems associated with HCT may not be familiar to clinicians who are not transplantation specialists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-survivorship/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. This is particularly important because some transplant centers &quot;discharge&quot; patients several months after transplantation to the care of the referring <span class=\"nowrap\">hematologist/oncologist</span> or primary care clinician. For centers in which patients have been discharged and the long-term care is done elsewhere, it is important to ensure that all long-term complications of HCT are reported to both the transplant team and current medical provider. When patients are discharged from direct care in a transplant center, responsibilities for follow-up of the individual test results should be clearly delineated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-approach-to-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-survivorship/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. A comprehensive survivorship care plan that outlines potential late and long-term effects, future screening, and monitoring tests should be devised, and the plan should be clearly communicated to the patient, the referring <span class=\"nowrap\">hematology/oncology</span> specialists, and the primary care provider. As part of the plan, it is crucial to report long-term adverse events back to the transplant center to help shape future long-term follow-up plans and to aid in the planning strategies to prevent these adverse outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

HCT can be broadly divided into subtypes based upon the hematopoietic cell donor, the source of hematopoietic progenitor cells, and the preparative regimen. Each of these factors influences efficacy and the short- and long-term toxicities associated with the procedure. (See <a href=\"#H83240218\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HCT survivors are at risk of developing therapy-related complications that may present years after treatment. These complications have surfaced as significant causes of increased mortality, and screening for some of these entities is advised in the hope that early detection may lead to better management. Our approach to the ongoing evaluation of the long-term HCT survivor is in general agreement with published guidelines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F59471\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59471 \">table 1</a>). Performance and interpretation of the recommended tests often involve consultation with subspecialists.

It is important for all providers to share findings, especially abnormal results of screening tests, and delineate responsibilities for follow-up and management. (See <a href=\"#H27546050\" class=\"local\">'Coordination of care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common long-term complications of autologous HCT are decreased lung function, infection, cardiovascular disease, and secondary malignancies.
