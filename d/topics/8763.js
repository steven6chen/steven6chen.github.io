Occasionally, the dialysis procedure does not remove sufficient solute or fluid, eventually causing uremia and volume overload.</p><p>This topic reviews factors that contribute to inadequate solute removal among peritoneal dialysis patients and provides an approach to the management of such patients.</p><p>The discussion assumes that solute removal was initially adequate and that solute removal has become impaired over time. A review of the factors that must be considered at the initiation of dialysis is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-a-modality-for-chronic-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choosing a modality for chronic peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The management of peritoneal dialysis patients with ultrafiltration failure and volume overload is discussed elsewhere.

Total solute clearance refers to the clearance provided by both dialysis and the small amount remaining of native kidney function (termed residual renal function). The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine are commonly used as markers for total solute clearance in peritoneal dialysis patients. A progressive increase in the BUN suggests that solute clearance has decreased, although progressive increases may also be caused by increased production of BUN. (See <a href=\"#H3274656167\" class=\"local\">'Causes of increased BUN'</a> below.)</p><p>Two metrics are commonly used to measure solute clearance by peritoneal dialysis. These include the weekly <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> and the creatinine clearance normalized to body surface area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inadequate-solute-clearance-in-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. We use the <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea,</span> which is consistent with the 2006 Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) guidelines, the 2005 European Best Practices Guidelines (EBPG), and the 2006 International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) <span class=\"nowrap\">guidelines/recommendations</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inadequate-solute-clearance-in-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>The daily peritoneal urea clearance (Kt) is the product of the total 24-hour peritoneal drain volume and the ratio of the urea concentration in the pooled drained dialysate to that in the plasma <span class=\"nowrap\">(D/P</span> urea). The volume of distribution of urea (Vurea) is approximately equal to body water (ie, 60 percent of ideal body weight in kg in men and 55 percent of ideal body weight in kg in women).</p><p>We use a 24-hour urea clearance to determine residual renal function. The 24-hour urea clearance is calculated as follows:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">[Urine urea <span class=\"nowrap\">(mg/dL)</span> x urine volume <span class=\"nowrap\">(mL)]/plasma</span> urea <span class=\"nowrap\">(mg/dL)</span> = urea clearance (in <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span></p></div></div><p/><p>Urea clearance in <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> x 1400 <span class=\"nowrap\">min/day</span> provides the urea clearance per day.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2243061102\"><span class=\"h2\">Solute transport rate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The solute transport rate is the rate at which solute moves from the blood compartment to the dialysate compartment during peritoneal dialysis (and conversely from dialysate to blood). The solute transport rate varies from patient to patient and may change over time in individual patients.</p><p>The solute transport rate is determined by a peritoneal equilibration test (PET). (See <a href=\"#H1483505816\" class=\"local\">'Peritoneal equilibration test'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peritoneal-equilibration-test\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peritoneal equilibration test&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3175591602\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrafiltration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrafiltration refers to the transport of water from blood to dialysate. The driving force for ultrafiltration is the glucose (or other osmotic or oncotic agent) present in dialysate. The ultrafiltration coefficient reflects the amount of ultrafiltration volume removed per gram of glucose absorbed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1483505816\"><span class=\"h2\">Peritoneal equilibration test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The PET is a highly reproducible procedure that characterizes solute transport and ultrafiltration across the peritoneal membrane. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peritoneal-equilibration-test\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peritoneal equilibration test&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The PET is performed in all patients early after initiation of peritoneal dialysis to classify membrane function so that the dialysis prescription can be optimized to specific membrane characteristics. This initial test provides a baseline for comparison if the rates of solute transport and ultrafiltration change over time. The PET is used as a diagnostic test to identify reasons for reduced solute clearance.</p><p>Based upon the results of the PET, patients are classified into four transport categories. Each classification is discussed in depth elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peritoneal-equilibration-test#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peritoneal equilibration test&quot;, section on 'Peritoneal membrane function classification'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>High transporter (or fast transporter) &ndash;</strong> High transporters achieve the most rapid equilibration between blood and dialysate and thus quickly lose the osmotic gradient required for ultrafiltration. High transporters remove solute well and tend to have adequate <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> but may have difficulty removing fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inadequate-solute-clearance-in-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Low transporter (or slow transporter) &ndash;</strong> Low transporters are characterized by slower and less complete equilibration. Low transporters remove fluid easily but may have difficulty removing solute (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> may be low) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inadequate-solute-clearance-in-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Average transporter &ndash;</strong> Average transporters have values that are intermediate between high and low transporters.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ROUTINE MONITORING FOR ADEQUATE CLEARANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We routinely monitor all peritoneal dialysis patients to make sure the dialysis procedure is working adequately. The optimal frequency of monitoring is not known. We do the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We assess volume status and uremic symptoms and perform laboratory evaluation monthly. Laboratory evaluation for dialysis adequacy includes measurement of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, and electrolytes. (As part of routine care of the dialysis patient, we also routinely follow calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone, complete blood count [CBC], iron, total iron-binding capacity [TIBC], and ferritin, but these measurements are not directly used to monitor for dialysis adequacy.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We measure residual renal function every other month. The patient submits a 24-hour urine collection, and urea clearance is determined from the urine volume, urine urea concentration, and the plasma urea concentration. The calculation of residual renal function and a representative example are provided elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescribing and assessing adequate peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We measure the total solute clearance (peritoneal dialysis <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> + residual renal function) every four months and in the setting of progressively increasing BUN. The patient submits a 24-hour urine collection and a 24-hour collection of total dialysis effluent (ie, total drain volume). We measure the total dialysate volume, dialysate urea concentration, and plasma urea concentration. The daily peritoneal urea clearance (Kt) is the product of the total 24-hour peritoneal drain volume and the ratio of the urea concentration in the pooled drained dialysate to that in the plasma <span class=\"nowrap\">(D/P</span> urea). The calculation of <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> and a representative example are provided elsewhere.(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis#H649141675\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescribing and assessing adequate peritoneal dialysis&quot;, section on 'Frequency of monitoring'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We perform a peritoneal equilibration test (PET) if the <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> is decreased from baseline. It is unusual for the <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> to change from baseline without an intervening event such as peritonitis. (See <a href=\"#H232213634\" class=\"local\">'Measure solute clearance'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We review the prescription with the patient to ensure compliance with the peritoneal dialysis prescription. We review the volume of drains to make sure that drains are complete and the catheter is working properly.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2988350979\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major clinical findings associated with inadequate dialysis are volume overload, a progressively increasing blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and, occasionally, uremic symptoms.</p><p>Because we follow laboratory values closely, a progressive increase in the BUN is usually detected before the onset of uremic symptoms. However, changes in BUN do not always reflect inadequate dialysis and must be carefully evaluated for cause. (See <a href=\"#H3274656167\" class=\"local\">'Causes of increased BUN'</a> below.)</p><p>Occasionally, patients who are not closely monitored with laboratory tests may present with uremic symptoms. Such patients may require hemodialysis while the evaluation of peritoneal dialysis is ongoing.

When patients markedly increase dietary protein intake above this amount, the BUN often increases despite good clearances.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypercatabolism </strong>&ndash; A hypercatabolic state can raise the BUN despite good clearances. Hypercatabolic states include acute illness (such as infection), increased tissue breakdown, metabolic acidosis, hyperthyroidism, or glucocorticoid use.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Gastrointestinal bleeding </strong>&ndash; Severe gastrointestinal bleeding can increase the BUN. Severe bleeding is usually obvious based on history. Occult bleeding is not sufficient to cause an increased BUN. (See <a href=\"#H2915583985\" class=\"local\">'Approach to patients with increasing BUN'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1315367869\"><span class=\"h3\">Decreased clearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Decreased solute clearance is due to the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Noncompliance with the dialysis </strong>&ndash; Noncompliance with the dialysis regimen is a common cause of reduced solute clearance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Loss of residual renal function </strong>&ndash; If residual renal clearance is contributing to total solute clearance, a significant decrease in renal function will decrease total solute clearance. This is reflected by a decrease in the 24-hour urea clearance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Low peritoneal dialysis solute clearance</strong> &ndash; Occasionally, peritoneal dialysis is performed correctly by the patient (ie, according to the prescription) but the solute transport rate has changed since dialysis was first started. Changes in the solute transport rate are reflected in the peritoneal equilibration test (PET). The PET is most useful if a baseline test is available for comparison. (See <a href=\"#H1483505816\" class=\"local\">'Peritoneal equilibration test'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peritoneal-equilibration-test#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peritoneal equilibration test&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis of causes of inadequate ultrafiltration and solute clearance'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Both a decrease and increase in the solute transport rate can reduce clearance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If the solute transport rate has declined from baseline, the peritoneal dialysis solute clearance decreases. The solute transport rate is determined by the membrane surface area and the intrinsic transport capacity of the membrane. Decreased solute transport rate is almost always due to a loss of contact surface area rather than a change in the intrinsic transport capacity, although occasionally both are present, as in late stages of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=encapsulating-peritoneal-sclerosis-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis in peritoneal dialysis patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Adhesions are a common cause of decreased surface area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inadequate-solute-clearance-in-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Adhesions are caused by blood, inflammation, and infection, often related to repeated episodes of severe peritonitis or abdominal surgery, particularly in the setting of bowel pathology.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Occasionally, an <strong>increase</strong> in the solute transport rate from a previously established baseline causes decreased solute removal. This appears counterintuitive since one expects more solute movement from blood to dialysate as diffusion rates increase. However, peritoneal dialysis solute clearance is determined by the final drain volume (instilled volume plus net ultrafiltration volume) and the concentration of the solute in the final drain volume. The drain volume is determined by the solute transport rate: If the solute transport rate is high, the osmotic gradient, which favors ultrafiltration, rapidly dissipates due to glucose absorption from dialysate into blood. As a result, if the dwell time is too long, much or all of the ultrafiltrated fluid, and, at times, even some of the initial instilled volume, may be <span class=\"nowrap\">reabsorbed/absorbed</span> from the peritoneal cavity into postcapillary venules and lymphatics, resulting in low drain volumes and correspondingly low total solute clearance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The rate of transport may transiently increase during an episode of peritonitis due to inflammation-related increases in perfusion of existing capillaries, which increases the capillary surface area. In such cases, the transport rate usually returns to baseline once peritonitis resolves.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In some patients, transport status slowly increases over time. This is thought to be due to angiogenesis resulting in an increase in the number of capillaries per unit space (capillary density), which also increases capillary surface area.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2915583985\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to patients with increasing BUN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation of peritoneal dialysis patients with increasing blood urea nitrogen (BUN) involves the assessment of production and clearance of solute and the assessment of compliance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F116429\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116429 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2215686807\"><span class=\"h3\">Exclude increased production</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We interview patients to assess compliance with diet. Protein intake above the recommended amount (ie, 1.2 to 1.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day</span> of high-biological-value protein) will increase total solute and BUN production. We review dietary restrictions in order to increase compliance.</p><p>We review medications to see if the patient has been started on glucocorticoids as glucocorticoids will increased BUN production. We exclude other causes of hypercatabolism, including infection, tissue breakdown, metabolic acidosis, and hyperthyroidism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-hyperthyroidism-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-hyperthyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of hyperthyroidism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=non-access-related-infections-in-chronic-dialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Non-access-related infections in chronic dialysis patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Treatment of the underlying cause for hypercatabolism will generally lower the BUN to the expected values.</p><p>We inquire as to a history of gastrointestinal bleeding. Severe gastrointestinal bleeding can increase the BUN independent of an increase in total solute production. Generally, the bleeding is obvious and not occult. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-suspected-small-bowel-bleeding-formerly-obscure-gastrointestinal-bleeding#H5874272\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of suspected small bowel bleeding (formerly obscure gastrointestinal bleeding)&quot;, section on 'Hemodynamically stable patients'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-occult-gastrointestinal-bleeding#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of occult gastrointestinal bleeding&quot;, section on 'Evaluation of a positive fecal occult blood test'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H379674962\"><span class=\"h3\">Assess compliance with peritoneal dialysis regimen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We ask patients whether they are compliant with the peritoneal dialysis prescription. We also estimate compliance with the prescription by assessing the patient's inventory of dialysis supplies. This is done by the nurse during home visits or by the person who delivers the patient's dialysis supplies.</p><p>It is difficult to accurately measure compliance as it may not be reflected in the <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span>. Among patients who are noncompliant with dialysis, the calculated <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> may be adequate because the patient has done the dialysis prescription exactly as prescribed on the day that <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> submits the 24-hour dialysate collection for testing but does not do the entire prescription on other days. In this case, the calculated weekly total solute clearance <span class=\"nowrap\">(Kt/Vurea)</span> is an overestimate of amount of dialysis being performed.</p><p>Among patients on automated peritoneal dialysis <span class=\"nowrap\">(APD)/continuous</span> cycler peritoneal dialysis (CCPD), software may be available within the cycler that records the patient's daily dwells and drains so the number of actual treatments performed is available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H232213634\"><span class=\"h3\">Measure solute clearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among patients with progressively increasing BUN, we measure the total solute clearance (peritoneal dialysis <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> + 24-hour urea clearance) as described above. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Routine monitoring for adequate clearance'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis#H1128862652\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescribing and assessing adequate peritoneal dialysis&quot;, section on 'Solute clearance'</a>.)</p><p>Patients who appear to be compliant with peritoneal dialysis and have reduced total solute clearance from their usual baseline require further evaluation and often a change in the peritoneal dialysis prescription in order to increase clearance. Our approach depends on whether the <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> or 24-hour urea clearance has declined.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1528758388\"><span class=\"h4\">Reduced residual renal function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is common for residual renal function to decline at some point after starting dialysis. This is reflected by a decrease in the 24-hour urea clearance. Among such patients, although the total solute clearance is decreased, the <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> is unchanged.</p><p>For such patients, we increase the dialysis dose, usually by increasing the volume of exchanges or the number of exchanges. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-peritoneal-dialysis#H1128862652\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescribing and assessing adequate peritoneal dialysis&quot;, section on 'Solute clearance'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1217319498\"><span class=\"h4\">Reduced peritoneal dialysis solute clearance (Kt/Vurea)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Occasionally, the residual renal function is unchanged but the peritoneal dialysis solute clearance has declined, as reflected in the <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span>. We perform a PET in such patients to re-evaluate solute transport characteristics of the peritoneal membrane. We adjust the dialysis prescription based on the results of the PET [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inadequate-solute-clearance-in-peritoneal-dialysis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-a-modality-for-chronic-peritoneal-dialysis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choosing a modality for chronic peritoneal dialysis&quot;, section on 'Dialysis prescription'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2333563938\"><span class=\"h5\">Low transporters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We initially try to provide more dialysis by increasing the volume of inflow dialysate per exchange. We do not increase the number of exchanges, since this decreases the actual time of contact between dialysate and peritoneal membrane and may decrease the dialysate to plasma ratio <span class=\"nowrap\">(D/P</span> urea), which determines the <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span>. An exception is patients on APD who do all exchanges at night; among such patients, if increasing the instilled volume per exchange is not tolerated or ineffective, then adding a midday exchange may help to achieve target clearance.</p><p>If these measures do not sufficiently improve solute clearances, then transfer of the patient to hemodialysis may be necessary. Occasionally, we combine hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis in order to achieve clearance targets, but this is uncommon. In our experience, adequate solute clearance can usually be achieved if the center is willing to individualize the patient's prescription and the patient is willing to do what is needed to reach target (such as doing a midday exchange if on APD). An exception is very large patients who have no residual renal function who may not easily reach peritoneal dialysis <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> targets.</p><p>There are no pharmacologic therapies that improve peritoneal transport and solute clearances. If the change in transport is due to loss of surface area contact due to multiple adhesions, laparoscopic lysis of adhesions by surgeons who are trained in this technique may restore contact surface area, although this is rarely done in practice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1335880939\"><span class=\"h5\">High transporters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the solute transport rate has increased, we increase the instilled volume per exchange and decrease the dwell time. Increasing the instilled volume slows the rate at which equilibrium is reached and increases the drain volume, which increases net solute clearance. Shortening the dwell time decreases the amount of time available for fluid absorption by lymphatics and postcapillary venules. Shortening the dwell time generally entails adding more exchanges per day (often achieved by adding a midday exchange).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32333769\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goals of peritoneal dialysis are to remove solute and fluid. If the dialysis procedure does not remove sufficient solute or fluid, uremia and volume overload may result. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peritoneal dialysis patients are closely monitored for volume status and appearance of uremic symptoms. We perform regularly scheduled laboratory evaluation and routinely measure total solute clearance, which is the sum of residual renal function (determined by 24-hour urea clearance) and peritoneal dialysis solute clearance (determined by the <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea)</span>. Our approach and frequency of monitoring are defined. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Routine monitoring for adequate clearance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine are markers for solute clearance. Increasing BUN may be due to increased production or decreased clearance of solute or to gastrointestinal bleeding. Our approach to the evaluation of progressively increasing BUN is defined above.

These are distinguished by analysis of individual components of the measured total solute clearance (ie, either peritoneal dialysis <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/Vurea</span> or 24-hour urea clearance). The peritoneal dialysis dose must be increased if residual renal function decreases.
