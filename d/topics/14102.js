The number of women of childbearing age who have received heart transplants has risen due partly to some overall increase in heart transplantation in adults and to survival of pediatric heart transplant recipients to childbearing age. Pregnancy after cardiac transplantation is associated with risks to the prospective mother and fetus and with concerns regarding maternal longevity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/2-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-7</a>]. </p><p>The maternal and fetal risks associated with pregnancy after cardiac transplantation and recommendations for management of these patients during pregnancy will be reviewed here. The indications and complications of cardiac transplantation are discussed separately.

As recommended by the American Society of Transplantation (AST) consensus conference on reproductive issues, preconception counseling should be introduced during the pretransplant evaluation (or earlier) and should be followed up throughout the post-transplant process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Transplant recipients need to know what to expect in terms of their own outcome and that for their potential children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>The reason for the mother's cardiac transplant should be investigated and discussed in terms of risk of recurrence of the underlying cardiac disease in mother or offspring. As an example, women who have received cardiac allografts because of severe peripartum cardiomyopathy are theoretically at risk for recurrent problems in future pregnancies (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peripartum-cardiomyopathy-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peripartum cardiomyopathy: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>). Another example is the risk of cardiac defects (concordant or discordant with the mother) in offspring of women with congenital or <span class=\"nowrap\">familial/genetic</span> types of heart disease (eg, 20 to 50 percent of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy cases may be familial).

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-after-cardiac-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis after cardiac transplantation&quot;</a>.) </p><p><br/>Contraception (including during the first year post-transplant) is important as fertility is not affected by immunosuppressive medications. Long-acting highly effective reversible options for contraception include the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etonogestrel-implant-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etonogestrel implant</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=copper-intrauterine-device-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">copper intrauterine device</a> (IUD), and levonorgestrel-releasing IUD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Nulliparity and immunosuppression are not contraindications to IUD use and the IUD is not associated with an increased risk of pelvic infection, except in the first 20 days after insertion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etonogestrel-contraceptive-implant\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etonogestrel contraceptive implant&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrauterine-contraception-candidates-and-device-selection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrauterine contraception: Candidates and device selection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrauterine-contraception-insertion-and-removal#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrauterine contraception: Insertion and removal&quot;, section on 'Sexually transmitted infections'</a>.)</p><p>Estrogen-progestin contraceptives are another effective option, but should be avoided in patients with contraindications to estrogen therapy (eg, increased risk of venous or arterial thrombosis, uncontrolled hypertension). Immunosuppressant drug blood levels should be monitored carefully when starting estrogen-progestin contraception due to inhibition of the cytochrome P450 3A4 pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

However, several of these changes may lead to clinical problems in the cardiac transplant recipient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. As an example, pregnancy-associated sodium retention may increase edema and thus exacerbate edema associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> use.

The heart rate is higher than in normals because of the loss of vagal neural input, which has a negative chronotropic effect. There may be partial reinnervation of cardiac sympathetic nerves following cardiac transplantation, but sinus tachycardia is common.

The process of chronic rejection of the allograft is also not affected by pregnancy-related changes in the maternal immune system; thus immunosuppressive agents must be continued and adjusted to maintain prepregnancy drug levels.

The treatment of hypertension is not affected by pregnancy, with the exception of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), which should be avoided because of teratogenic effects and aldosterone antagonists.

Fortunately, high risk lesions are rare in the heart transplant recipient, so such prophylaxis is rarely necessary. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-the-prevention-of-bacterial-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimicrobial prophylaxis for the prevention of bacterial endocarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intramuscular or intravenous opiates are used to relieve pain and apprehension. Lumbar epidural anesthesia is effective in controlling labor pain and is recommended because it lowers pain-induced elevations of sympathetic activity. Epidural anesthesia has been used successfully in cardiac transplant recipients for both vaginal and cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/5,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Stress dose steroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who received greater than 20 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> per day for more than three weeks in the six months prior to surgery should be assumed to have suppression of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-use-of-glucocorticoids#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic use of glucocorticoids&quot;, section on 'HPA axis suppression'</a>). These individuals should receive peripartum stress glucocorticoid coverage.</p><p>One approach is to provide high doses of glucocorticoids starting at the time of active labor. A continuous infusion of 10 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> per hour, or the equivalent amount of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a>, eliminates the possibility of glucocorticoid deficiency. The glucocorticoid dose can be halved the day after delivery and the maintenance dose usually can be resumed on the second postpartum day. An alternative regimen is described in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F73698\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73698 \">table 2</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Maternal monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pregnant mother should have continuous electrocardiographic monitoring during delivery to evaluate for arrhythmias and serial electrocardiograms to evaluate for ischemia, in addition to routine assessment of vital signs (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ventricular-arrhythmias-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ventricular arrhythmias during pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=supraventricular-arrhythmias-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Supraventricular arrhythmias during pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arrhythmias-following-cardiac-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arrhythmias following cardiac transplantation&quot;</a>). Coronary vasculopathy is common in the transplanted heart, while the clinical signs and symptoms of ischemia are greatly attenuated owing to denervation of the allograft. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-and-risk-factors-for-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of and risk factors for cardiac allograft vasculopathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and prognosis of cardiac allograft vasculopathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of cardiac allograft vasculopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Invasive cardiovascular monitoring is not routinely required.

The risks of maternal compromise increase substantially immediately postpartum. Cardiac output increases to 80 percent above prelabor values due to significant autotransfusion associated with uterine involution. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-cardiovascular-and-hemodynamic-changes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Cardiovascular and hemodynamic changes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Drug toxicity is more likely postpartum. Careful attention to immunosuppressive drug levels, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> in particular, is warranted as maternal intravascular volume and glomerular hyperfiltration return to normal.</p><p>Serial electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and isoenzymes are helpful during this high risk period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Cardiac biopsy is indicated if acute rejection is suspected.</p><p>Breastfeeding is generally discouraged because of passage of immunosuppressive drugs, particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>, to the baby [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Continuing immunosuppressive therapy is vital for the mother and should be carefully maintained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The American Society of Transplantation (AST) consensus opinion was that breastfeeding need not be viewed as absolutely contraindicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) guidelines note that it is uncertain whether the risks of infant drug exposure outweigh the benefits and they do not recommend that heart transplant recipients breastfeed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A discussion with the baby's pediatrician regarding the risks versus benefits of breastfeeding, taking into account individual circumstances, is worthwhile. Psychologic support is also important because postpartum depression can be exaggerated by chronic steroid use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family planning and pregnancy including risks, alternatives, and timing should be discussed with all women of childbearing age undergoing cardiac transplantation as many transplant recipients are fertile.
