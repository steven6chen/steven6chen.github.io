These studies help to determine the appropriate therapy and the patient's prognosis.</p><p>A general review of the initial laboratory studies, imaging studies, staging, and prognosis of NHL will be presented here. Of note, the appropriate pretreatment evaluation differs by histologic subtype. As such, details regarding the pretreatment evaluation of many NHL histologies are presented separately as part of the discussion of their initial treatment. The clinical presentation and basic diagnostic tests are presented separately as well.

Specific examples are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1150653623\"><span class=\"h2\">CBC and peripheral smear</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients should have a complete blood count (CBC) with white blood cell differential and an evaluation of their peripheral smear. Abnormalities of the CBC are seen in approximately 60 percent of patients at the time of initial evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-staging-and-response-assessment-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In one study, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia were noted in 42, 16, and 6 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-staging-and-response-assessment-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. There appears to be a strong correlation between cytopenias and involvement of the bone marrow (BM) with NHL; BM involvement was identified by BM biopsy in 100, 69, 63, and 13 percent of patients with neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, anemia, or a normal CBC, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-staging-and-response-assessment-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The presence of malignant cells in the peripheral blood is generally indicative of extensive marrow involvement and is seen in approximately 10 percent of all patients with NHL at diagnosis. It is most frequently seen in indolent lymphomas, occurring in 33 and 100 percent of patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), respectively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F65023\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65023 \">picture 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-staging-and-response-assessment-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Flow cytometry of the peripheral blood can confirm the presence of circulating lymphoma cells.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Practically all patients with NHL should undergo a BM aspiration and biopsy prior to the initiation of treatment as part of their staging evaluation. A potential exception is for patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with evidence of advanced-stage disease on imaging with positron emission tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET)/computed</span> tomography (CT). It remains controversial whether patients require bilateral or unilateral BM biopsies. Overall, morphologic BM involvement occurs in 30 to 50 percent of all patients with NHL, most commonly in the indolent histologies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-staging-and-response-assessment-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Depending upon the subtype of NHL, evaluation of the BM may include special stains, flow cytometry, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> genetics. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Initial evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>The role of BM aspiration and biopsy in the staging of DLBCL is evolving [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-staging-and-response-assessment-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. We perform unilateral BM biopsies as part of the initial staging assessment of most patients with DLBCL. A 2014 meta-analysis that included data from 654 patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL estimated the sensitivity and specificity of <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> for detection of BM involvement to be 88.7 and 99.8 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-staging-and-response-assessment-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Approximately 3 percent of patients with a negative <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> had evidence of disease on BM biopsy. In contrast, 12 percent of patients with a negative BM biopsy had evidence of disease on <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span>. These results suggest that a negative <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> cannot rule out the presence of low-volume, diffuse disease in the BM. As such, BM biopsy is an important part of the evaluation of the patient without evidence of bone involvement by PET. In contrast, BM biopsy may not necessary if the PET indicates bone or marrow involvement.</p><p>BM aspiration and biopsy is an important part of staging of other NHL histologies. In a study of 176 patients with NHL, among the 57 patients with indolent disease, 12 and 44 percent had unilateral and bilateral BM involvement, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-staging-and-response-assessment-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Among the 112 patients with aggressive histologies, involvement was unilateral or bilateral in 5 and 8 percent, respectively.</p><p>Although bilateral biopsies increase the diagnostic yield by as much as 26 percent, this difference may not be therapeutically important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-staging-and-response-assessment-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. As an example, one study reported that the second BM biopsy resulted in a change of disease stage in only 6 and 2.5 percent of those with indolent or aggressive NHL, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-staging-and-response-assessment-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Thus, performing bilateral biopsies had a limited effect on upstaging most patients with either indolent or aggressive histologies from stage <span class=\"nowrap\">I/II</span> to stage IV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-staging-and-response-assessment-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This issue may be obviated to some extent by obtaining a longer BM biopsy specimen.

Although clinical evidence of renal involvement with lymphoma is only seen in 2 to 14 percent of all patients, an elevated serum creatinine is reported in 26 to 56 percent. Of importance, an elevated BUN or creatinine level may indicate bilateral ureteral obstruction secondary to massive enlargement of retroperitoneal nodes. This testing is also important as a guide to treatment, since many chemotherapeutic agents are nephrotoxic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> excreted through the kidney (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F54722\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54722 \">table 1</a>).

High levels require attention before chemotherapy can be safely given, especially when there is the possibility of a rapid reduction in tumor mass following chemotherapy (ie, tumor lysis syndrome).

In addition, FDG uptake may be abnormally increased in the spleen or marrow following stimulation with chemotherapy or growth factors (eg, G-CSF). In such situations, a complete molecular response may be inferred if uptake at sites of initial involvement is less than surrounding normal tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-staging-and-response-assessment-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Different Deauville score cutoffs may be used in clinical trials that incorporate PET scanning into treatment planning.

In contrast, studies designed to evaluate treatment deescalation may choose a lower cutoff (eg, Deauville score 2).</p><p>The &#8710;SUVmax is an alternative semi-quantitative method of evaluating PET response in lymphoma. However, calculation of &#8710;SUVmax requires baseline images with an institution specific dose calibrator.

In DLBCL, <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> is highly specific and more sensitive than BM biopsy for the detection of BM involvement at the time of diagnosis, but may miss diffuse, low-volume (10 to 20 percent of marrow) BM involvement. In a meta-analysis that included data from seven studies with a total of 654 patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL, PET had moderate sensitivity (88.7 percent) and high specificity (99.8 percent) for the detection of BM involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-staging-and-response-assessment-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Approximately 3 percent of patients with involvement on BM biopsy had a negative PET scan, while 13 percent with involvement on PET scan had a negative BM biopsy. Thus, for patients with DLBCL, normal BM on PET scan cannot rule out the presence of BM involvement, but FDG uptake in the BM on PET scan is highly specific for lymphomatous BM involvement.

A number of metrics have been developed to quantify performance status; among them, the Karnofsky performance status (KPS) and the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status are the most commonly used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58785%7EHEME%2F72901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58785 graphicRef72901 \">table 8A-B</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h1\">STAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Lugano classification is the current staging system used for patients with NHL. The Lugano classification is based on the Ann Arbor staging system, which was originally developed for Hodgkin lymphoma in 1974 and modified in 1988 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-staging-and-response-assessment-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/86,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">86,87</a>]. This staging system focuses on the number of tumor sites (nodal and extranodal) and their location (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97479\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97479 \">table 9</a>). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage I refers to NHL involving a single lymph node region (stage I) or a single extralymphatic organ or site (stage IE) without nodal involvement. A single lymph node region can include one node or a group of adjacent nodes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F55422\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55422 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage II refers to two or more involved lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm (stage II) or with localized involvement of an extralymphatic organ or site (stage IIE).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage III refers to lymph node involvement on both sides of the diaphragm (stage III).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage IV refers to the presence of diffuse or disseminated involvement of one or more extralymphatic organs (eg, liver, bone marrow, lung), with or without associated lymph node involvement.</p><p/><p>The subscript &quot;E&quot; is used if limited extranodal extension is documented; more extensive extranodal disease is designated stage IV. Disease involving the spleen is considered nodal, rather than extranodal. The subscript &quot;X&quot; had been used in the Ann Arbor staging system to designate the presence of bulky disease. Instead of using the designation &quot;X,&quot; the Lugano classification requires a recording of the largest tumor diameter. For treatment purposes, criteria for bulky disease vary by histology and no cutoff has been validated using modern treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-staging-and-response-assessment-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/6,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,31</a>]. However, cutoffs of 6 cm and 6 to 10 cm have been used for follicular lymphoma and diffuse large B cell lymphoma, respectively.</p><p>Unlike Hodgkin lymphoma, systemic &quot;B&quot; symptoms (fever, sweats, weight loss) are no longer incorporated into the staging system for NHL. This is primarily because these systemic symptoms have not been independent prognostic factors in patients with NHL. </p><p>Since NHLs most frequently disseminate hematogenously, this staging system has proven to be much less useful than for Hodgkin lymphoma, which disseminates principally by contiguous lymphatic extension. As an example, only 10 percent of patients with follicular lymphoma have localized disease at diagnosis (ie, stage I), and the majority of patients with aggressive lymphomas have advanced stage disease (ie, stage <span class=\"nowrap\">III/IV)</span> at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-staging-and-response-assessment-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. It is generally accepted that there is little therapeutic benefit in distinguishing between stages III and IV disease in NHL, since treatment options are nearly identical.</p><p>Thus, staging is undertaken in NHLs to identify the small numbers of patients with &quot;early stage disease&quot; who can be treated with local therapy or combined modality treatment, and to stratify within histologic subtypes in order to determine prognosis and assess the impact of treatment.

In a minority of patients, a paradoxical &quot;tumor flare&quot; may be observed within the first weeks of treatment that actually represents a response to therapy. This self-limited response may be manifest as increased size of lymph nodes, lymphocytosis, bone pain, or an increase in serum paraproteins (eg, increased serum IgM and serum viscosity in Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia). In time, many of these responses will convert to partial or complete responses. Because lymphomas may respond more slowly to these agents than to conventional chemotherapy, caution is justified before judging a treatment as ineffective and discontinuing therapy. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H334141054\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple studies have demonstrated that prognosis of NHL is far more dependent upon histopathology, being only secondarily influenced by clinical parameters including age, presence of extranodal disease, performance status, and stage <span class=\"nowrap\">(I/II</span> versus <span class=\"nowrap\">III/IV)</span>. Since stage usually depends only upon the location and number of disease sites, it is not a true measure of tumor burden, which is clearly an important prognostic determinant in NHL, and may also affect the overall treatment program employed (eg, use of adjuvant radiotherapy to sites of bulky disease).</p><p>The determination of prognosis for each of the NHL variants is known to be related to the multiple differences in tumor cell biology (eg, cytogenetics, immunophenotype, growth fraction, cytokine production) found within each of the specific disease variants.
