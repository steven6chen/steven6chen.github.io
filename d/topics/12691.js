They include conditions that cause acute illness with severe thyroid pain (eg, subacute thyroiditis and infectious thyroiditis) and conditions in which there is no clinically evident inflammation and the illness is manifested primarily by thyroid dysfunction or goiter (eg, painless thyroiditis and fibrous [Riedel's] thyroiditis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-thyroiditis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>This topic review provides an overview of the different types of thyroiditis. These disorders can be categorized in several ways: according to their known or suspected etiology, their pathology, or their clinical features. The approach we use is to categorize thyroiditis according to whether it is associated with thyroid pain and tenderness because the presence or absence of those findings dominates the major diagnostic considerations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F79384\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79384 \">table 1</a>). The diagnosis and management of several of the individual disorders, ie, subacute thyroiditis (or subacute granulomatous thyroiditis), painless thyroiditis, and postpartum thyroiditis, are discussed in more detail elsewhere, as is chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's thyroiditis). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subacute-thyroiditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subacute thyroiditis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=painless-thyroiditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Painless thyroiditis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-hashimotos-thyroiditis-chronic-autoimmune-thyroiditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (chronic autoimmune thyroiditis)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-thyroiditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum thyroiditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NOMENCLATURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is some controversy concerning the nomenclature used to categorize the different forms of thyroiditis. However, most thyroidologists use the term subacute thyroiditis to apply to a specific disease called subacute granulomatous thyroiditis. Infectious thyroiditis is also called suppurative thyroiditis, and painless thyroiditis is also known as silent thyroiditis and lymphocytic thyroiditis with spontaneously resolving hyperthyroidism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">THYROIDITIS WITH THYROID PAIN AND TENDERNESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Causes of this pattern of thyroiditis include subacute, infectious, traumatic, and radiation thyroiditis. Painful Hashimoto's thyroiditis is very rare and, in some circumstances, has been treated surgically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-thyroiditis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Subacute thyroiditis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the hyperthyroid phase, subacute thyroiditis (subacute granulomatous thyroiditis) is characterized by neck pain; a tender, diffuse goiter; and elevated thyroxine (T4) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> triiodothyronine (T3). The classic pattern of changes in thyroid function in patients with subacute is hyperthyroidism, followed by hypothyroidism, and then recovery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F75131\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75131 \">figure 1</a>). Hyperthyroidism, when it occurs, is due to damage to thyroid follicular cells and breakdown of stored thyroglobulin, leading to unregulated release of T4 and T3. Since ongoing synthesis of the thyroid hormones is inhibited due to thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression and thyroid radioiodine uptake is low during the hyperthyroid phase (in contrast to Graves' hyperthyroidism), the hyperthyroidism lasts only until the stores of T4 and T3 are depleted, usually two to six weeks. Hypothyroidism is also usually transient but can occasionally be permanent.</p><p>Other names for this disorder include subacute nonsuppurative thyroiditis, de Quervain's thyroiditis, or subacute granulomatous thyroiditis. It is presumed to be caused by a viral infection or postviral inflammatory process because many patients have a history of an upper respiratory infection preceding the onset of thyroiditis, and clusters of cases have occurred in association with epidemics of Coxsackievirus or other viral infections. There is a strong association with HLA-B35. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subacute-thyroiditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subacute thyroiditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Infectious thyroiditis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infectious thyroiditis may be either acute or chronic. Acute infections, with abscess formation, may be caused by gram-positive or gram-negative organisms, which reach the thyroid either via hematogenous spread, usually in an immunocompromised patient or via a fistula from the piriform sinus adjacent to the larynx [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-thyroiditis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The latter is probably the most common cause of suppurative thyroiditis, and it usually occurs in children. The organisms most commonly reported to cause acute infectious thyroiditis are Staphylococcus and Streptococcus, but many other pathogens have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-thyroiditis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Other infections of the thyroid, including mycobacterial, fungal, and Pneumocystis infections, are more chronic, and these infections occur most frequently in immunocompromised patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-thyroiditis/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].</p><p>Acute infectious thyroiditis is characterized by the sudden onset of neck pain and tenderness that is usually unilateral and is accompanied by fever, chills, and other symptoms and signs of infection. Most patients have a unilateral neck mass, which may be fluctuant. Acute neck pain and tenderness and a thyroid mass may also be caused by hemorrhage into a thyroid nodule and subacute thyroiditis. Thyroid function in patients with acute infectious thyroiditis is usually normal, but thyrotoxicosis may be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-thyroiditis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Thyroid ultrasound can differentiate between subacute thyroiditis (diffuse heterogeneity and low intensity vascular flow) and infectious thyroiditis (abscess), as can fine-needle aspiration biopsy (multinucleated giant cell granulomas in subacute thyroiditis versus fluid collection with microbes on bacteriologic examination and culture in infectious thyroiditis).</p><p>A patient who has a painful tender thyroid mass should be evaluated immediately with clinical examination, ultrasonography, and needle aspiration of the mass, followed by drainage and antibiotic therapy according to the results of studies of the fluid obtained from the neck mass or of blood or other cultures. Ultrasonography or other imaging studies should be performed to confirm the presence of a single abscess and to confirm the diagnosis. In most instances, rapid diagnosis and treatment is required. Intravenous antibiotics are generally preferred over oral antibiotics as initial treatment for acute bacterial thyroiditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-thyroiditis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Infrequently, surgical drainage or removal is required in patients who do not respond to percutaneous drainage and systemic antibiotic therapy.</p><p>Patients with more chronic thyroid infections often have bilateral disease. Thyroid pain and tenderness are less prominent than with acute infections, and some patients have hypothyroidism. The essential steps in evaluation are aspiration biopsy of the thyroid to identify the causative organism and radiologic studies to identify fistulae or tracts contributing to the disease process and to confirm the diagnosis. Otolaryngology consult and relevant head and neck examination may also be helpful in this regard.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation thyroiditis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An occasional patient with hyperthyroidism caused by Graves' disease, who is treated with radioiodine, develops thyroid pain and tenderness 5 to 10 days later, due to radiation-induced injury and necrosis of thyroid follicular cells and associated inflammation. The neck pain and tenderness are usually mild and subside spontaneously in a few days to one week. There also may be transient exacerbation of the hyperthyroidism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radioiodine-in-the-treatment-of-hyperthyroidism#H30632421\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radioiodine in the treatment of hyperthyroidism&quot;, section on 'Adverse effects'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Palpation or trauma-induced thyroiditis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vigorous palpation of the thyroid gland during physical examination, manipulation of the gland during thyroid biopsy or neck surgery, especially parathyroid surgery, or even trauma (ie, from an automobile seat belt) can cause thyroiditis, manifested by transient neck pain and tenderness and transient hyperthyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-thyroiditis/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">THYROIDITIS WITHOUT PAIN AND TENDERNESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Causes of this pattern of thyroiditis include painless, postpartum, drug-induced, and fibrous thyroiditis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Painless thyroiditis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Painless thyroiditis is characterized primarily by transient hyperthyroidism, followed sometimes by hypothyroidism, and then recovery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F75131\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75131 \">figure 1</a>). It is also known as silent thyroiditis and lymphocytic thyroiditis with spontaneously resolving hyperthyroidism.</p><p>Painless thyroiditis accounts for 1 to 5 percent of cases of hyperthyroidism. It is considered a variant form of chronic autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto's thyroiditis), suggesting that it is part of the spectrum of thyroid autoimmune disease. It can also be caused by administration of interferon alfa, interleukin-2, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> administration, although the pathogenesis of these disorders may be different. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Drug-induced thyroiditis'</a> below.)</p><p>Painless thyroiditis should be considered as the cause of hyperthyroidism in any woman (who is not postpartum) or man who has had symptoms for less than two months and has a small diffuse goiter or no thyroid enlargement. The key clinical findings are mild hyperthyroidism of short duration, little or no thyroid enlargement, and no Graves' ophthalmopathy or pretibial myxedema. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=painless-thyroiditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Painless thyroiditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Postpartum thyroiditis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postpartum thyroiditis is similar clinically and pathogenetically to painless thyroiditis except that, by definition, it occurs in women within one year after parturition (or after spontaneous or induced abortion). Based upon biochemical studies, it occurs after approximately 8 to 10 percent of pregnancies, although the number of women with clinically evident thyroid disease is lower. In clinically hyperthyroid women, it must be distinguished from postpartum exacerbations of Graves' disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-thyroiditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum thyroiditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Postpartum thyroiditis differs from painless thyroiditis in that more patients have elevated levels of serum antithyroid antibody (ie, antithyroglobulin or antithyroid peroxidase antibodies) concentrations, the concentrations are higher, and the likelihood of permanent thyroid disease later is greater. This apparent difference may reflect the greater ease of studying postpartum women prospectively than women in the general population. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=painless-thyroiditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Painless thyroiditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Drug-induced thyroiditis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients receiving interferon alfa, interleukin-2, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a>, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, or checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy may develop thyroiditis without pain. Its occurrence in patients receiving these drugs does not seem coincidental, and the evidence of a causal association is best for interferon alfa and tyrosine kinase inhibitors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Interferon alfa</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thyroid disorders are common in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, particularly women. In addition, many patients with HCV infection develop thyroid disease during interferon alfa therapy.</p><p>The most common interferon alfa-associated thyroid abnormality is the development of de novo antithyroid antibodies without clinical disease (5 to 15 percent). Approximately 5 to 10 percent of patients develop clinical thyroid disease, including painless thyroiditis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, or Graves' disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-thyroiditis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of interferon therapy in liver disease and the induction of autoimmunity&quot;</a>.)</p><p>These changes usually appear after three months of therapy but can occur as long as interferon alfa is given. The risk of any form of thyroid dysfunction is greater in those patients who have increased serum antithyroid antibody concentrations before initiation of interferon alfa, a finding that suggests that it in some way exacerbates underlying thyroid autoimmune disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-interferon-therapy-in-liver-disease-and-the-induction-of-autoimmunity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of interferon therapy in liver disease and the induction of autoimmunity&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-side-effects-of-peginterferon-and-ribavirin-used-for-treatment-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the side effects of peginterferon and ribavirin used for treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Interleukin-2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with metastatic cancer and leukemia are sometimes treated with interleukin-2, usually in combination with other cytokines or anticancer drugs. In several studies, a syndrome mimicking painless thyroiditis occurred in approximately 2 percent of the patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-thyroiditis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Amiodarone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amiodarone</a> is an antiarrhythmic drug that contains 37 percent iodine. As a result, it can affect thyroid function in several different ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Amiodarone</a> can cause hyperthyroidism. There are two types of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT).

In a retrospective study of patients with Graves' hyperthyroidism and painless thyroiditis, the odds of lithium exposure were higher in patients with painless thyroiditis as compared with those with Graves' disease (odds of exposure 4.7, 95% CI 1.3-17.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-thyroiditis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

In euthyroid patients with intact thyroid glands, these agents have been associated with the development of hypothyroidism and an elevated TSH in approximately 50 to 70 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-thyroiditis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Hypothyroidism has been most frequently reported with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sunitinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sunitinib</a>, but it appears to be a class effect and probably can occur with any tyrosine kinase inhibitor.

It is probably a primary fibrosing disorder and has been reported in patients who also had mediastinal and retroperitoneal fibrosis.</p><p>Affected patients have neck discomfort or tightness, sometimes dysphagia or hoarseness, and a diffuse, although occasionally asymmetric, goiter that is very hard, fixed, and often not clearly separable from the adjacent tissues. Most patients are euthyroid, but a few are hypothyroid, and serum antithyroid antibody concentrations are often high. The diagnosis is established by thyroid biopsy.
