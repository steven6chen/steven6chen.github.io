Despite this, because of concerns related to the real and perceived invasiveness of surgical intervention, there is hesitation and apprehension by patients, families, and physicians that may delay referral for definitive surgical therapy. In this review, the term &quot;minimally invasive&quot; valve surgery (MIVS) refers specifically to a set of techniques using direct, thorascopic, or robotic approaches developed specifically for cardiac surgical interventions with a smaller incision than with the traditional median sternotomy approach. These techniques, introduced in the 1990s, aim to reduce morbidity and enhance patient recovery and satisfaction by replacing the traditional median sternotomy with smaller alternative nonsternotomy incisions. </p><p>This topic will discuss minimally invasive aortic and mitral valve surgery. Although MIVS procedures share common rationale and approaches, their specific uses in aortic and mitral valve surgery are discussed separately.</p><p>Transcatheter approaches for aortic, pulmonic, and mitral valve disease are not included in the category of minimally invasive surgery. These transcatheter approaches obviate the need for both open incision and cardiopulmonary bypass and are reviewed elsewhere.

This is even more critical for mitral valve repair since the likelihood of successful repair (versus replacement) varies significantly with both individual surgeon and institutional volumes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimally-invasive-aortic-and-mitral-valve-surgery/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Performing these procedures through minimally invasive valve surgery (MIVS) is even more challenging and also requires single lung ventilation for portions of the procedure. Many cardiac surgeons perform low numbers of valve operations as reflected by a report based on the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) database that documented a median of five mitral valve surgical interventions performed per year per surgeon. It is also notable that only 70 percent of low-risk patients undergo repair even in the current era (2007 to 2010) based upon data from the STS database [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimally-invasive-aortic-and-mitral-valve-surgery/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Finally, Maze atrial fibrillation ablation procedures (with left atrial appendage amputation) are commonly indicated in patients with MV pathology and are more challenging through nonsternotomy approaches. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-ablation-to-prevent-recurrent-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical ablation to prevent recurrent atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2552109848\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient selection and evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A detailed patient assessment is required prior to aortic or mitral valve surgery to assess potential risks and benefits of available approaches and choose the optimum surgical approach. Although minimally invasive aortic valve surgery procedures are becoming more standardized and common, patients are still highly screened and selected. In contemporary series by leading centers, nearly 30 percent of patients undergoing aortic valve surgery undergo this procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimally-invasive-aortic-and-mitral-valve-surgery/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], and in large national registries, only 20 percent of patients are approached by these techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimally-invasive-aortic-and-mitral-valve-surgery/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], although the incidence is rising.</p><p>Routine imaging (contrast enhanced computed tomography angiography or magnetic resonance angiography) is critical in the selection of incisions for potential MIVS to better assess precise location of the aorta, degree of calcification, distance from the planned incision to the valve and annulus, degree of aortic valve and subvalvular calcification, and to assess peripheral arteries to help plan precise aortic cannulation and cross clamping sites. </p><p>The following are typical exclusions (although some experienced surgical teams will perform MIVS in selected patients with one or more of these characteristics):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Need for concomitant coronary revascularization (although isolated non-left <span class=\"nowrap\">main/left</span> anterior descending coronary artery disease can be treated with percutaneous coronary intervention).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of complex ascending aortic pathology (eg, acute dissection).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complex aortic or mitral valve pathology (acute bacterial endocarditis, bicuspid valve, heavy calcification extending onto the mitral valve, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> left ventricular outflow track).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obesity or funnel chest limiting access or visibility.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior right thoracotomy, radiation, pulmonary hypertension, or severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease if a limited anterior thoracotomy approach is contemplated, as these conditions may preclude single lung ventilation and safe robotic or port access thorascopic approaches.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2173285591\"><span class=\"h1\">POSSIBLE ADVANTAGES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A potential advantage of minimally invasive valve surgery (MIVS) is that a smaller incision may result in the following potential benefits: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased risk of sternal infection </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced ventilator support time and postoperative pulmonary complications</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced transfusion and perioperative atrial fibrillation rates</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shorter intensive care unit and hospital stays</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enhanced patient satisfaction and sense of recovery along with</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Decreased postoperative pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Enhanced early sternal stability (more limited sternal precautions) with earlier return to full unrestricted activity and improve quality of life.</p><p/><p>While some observational studies have found modest improvements in the above metrics (see <a href=\"#H3268489254\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes for minimally invasive aortic valve surgery'</a> below and <a href=\"#H4029730579\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes for minimally invasive mitral valve surgery'</a> below), these gains are meaningful only if MIVS procedures meet expectations for not compromising the safety, scope (extent), success, or durability of more established surgical approaches.

For traditional median sternotomy, arterial cannulation is generally performed in the ascending aorta and venous cannulation is generally performed through the appendage of the right atrium with the distal tip in the inferior vena cava (or through separate superior vena cava and inferior vena cava cannulation) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F97188\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef97188 \">figure 1</a>). Specific considerations and modifications for minimally invasive aortic valve surgery and minimally invasive mitral valve surgery are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H2017423816\" class=\"local\">'Access for cardiopulmonary bypass and cardioplegia'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H559448222\"><span class=\"h2\">Factors limiting generalizability of results</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although outcomes have been promising for many study populations as described below, generalizing study conclusions to most or all patients undergoing surgical aortic and mitral valve surgery is problematic given the following issues: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individual patient risks (including comorbidities, clinical status prior to valve surgery, and body habitus) and valve pathologies are highly varied.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Constant evolution of techniques and technologies make comparisons challenging and less relevant over time. It is important to note that because of strong patient preferences, median sternotomy approaches have also evolved to smaller (7 to 10 cm) incisions to provide similar cosmetic and recovery goals of nonsternotomy minimally invasive mitral valve surgery and minimally invasive aortic valve replacement incisions with standard central cardiopulmonary bypass techniques with very high mitral valve repair rates (&gt;90 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimally-invasive-aortic-and-mitral-valve-surgery/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Outcomes vary with individual surgeon and institutional experience. Results from high-volume institutions may not be generalizable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Randomized trials comparing these approaches with more traditional median sternotomy approaches are limited and frequently underpowered. Thus, most of the available evidence comes from observational studies subject to the following limitations that may not be adequately adjusted for by analysis tools such as propensity matching:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients undergoing current MIVS are carefully screened and selected, and have different clinical profiles (lower risk), as well as scope of therapies (more limited procedures or pathologies) from those undergoing median sternotomy valve surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Surgeons and teams performing MIVS procedures are typically more experienced (operator and institutional biases). </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2571292137\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications with MIVS are similar to those for conventional surgery but there are some specific site-related complication risks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimally-invasive-aortic-and-mitral-valve-surgery/abstract/2,11-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,11-16</a>]. </p><p>Current open cardiac surgical therapies, whether performed through a median sternotomy or alternative smaller incisions, continue to rely on cardiopulmonary bypass and a still operative cardiac field (myocardial cardioplegic arrest and protection) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimally-invasive-aortic-and-mitral-valve-surgery/abstract/2,11-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,11-16</a>]. This facilitates complete and safe exposure that enables full correction of all underlying valve pathologies. Much of the morbidity of open cardiac surgical interventions are related to the proinflammatory and anticoagulant effects of cardiopulmonary bypass, to aortic manipulation (cannulation, clamping, and de-clamping), and to myocardial protection during cardioplegic arrest. Thus, minimally invasive techniques do not avoid most of the complications related to open cardiac surgery. </p><p>Various surgical approaches are associated with some specific site-related complications. Partial or hemi-sternotomy is associated with an increased risk of injury to the right internal mammary artery and vein. These have to be carefully inspected and controlled to avert postoperative bleeding and re-exploration. Anterior thoracotomy and parasternal incisions may be associated with an increased wound complication rate, including incisional hernias, dehiscence, seroma formation, phrenic injury, and infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimally-invasive-aortic-and-mitral-valve-surgery/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Single lung ventilation performed with cardiopulmonary bypass has been associated with rare lung re-expansion reperfusion injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimally-invasive-aortic-and-mitral-valve-surgery/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. </p><p>Conversion from minimally invasive incisions to full sternotomy occur in 2 to 3 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimally-invasive-aortic-and-mitral-valve-surgery/abstract/6,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,19</a>]. These can occur pre-cardiopulmonary bypass for poor visualization. When conversions occur after initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass for bleeding complications or ventricular dysfunction, conversions are associated with a much higher in-hospital mortality (33 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimally-invasive-aortic-and-mitral-valve-surgery/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Patients and their families should be informed of this potential risk along with the risk of other complications before informed consent is obtained. </p><p>As discussed above, peripheral vascular atheromatous disease should be excluded preoperatively (via computed tomography or magnetic resonance). Even in the absence of overt peripheral vascular pathology, retrograde arterial perfusion for cardiopulmonary bypass through the femoral artery is associated with a risk of vascular complications including the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A 2 to 4 percent incidence of access site complications such as seroma formation, infection, femoral artery dissection, stenosis, pseudoaneurysm formation, and lymphatic leaks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimally-invasive-aortic-and-mitral-valve-surgery/abstract/19,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21</a>]. These complications can significantly delay recovery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Femoral venous thrombosis from instrumentation for cardiopulmonary bypass is rare (0.6 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Increased (twofold) incidence of stroke (attributed to cerebral emboli) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimally-invasive-aortic-and-mitral-valve-surgery/abstract/12,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,19</a>]. </p><p/><p>The pericardium and multiple port access incisions are less effectively inspected and drained during MIVS than with a conventional median sternotomy. Drainage may be impaired in the postoperative period, resulting in subacute tamponade or residual pericardial effusion in the presence of excess postoperative mediastinal drainage.</p><p>Complete evacuation and removal of air trapped in the left ventricle is more difficult and incomplete, thus posing a potential risk of air emboli. This should be monitored with transesophageal echocardiography and can be ameliorated with carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) field insufflation (since CO<sub>2 </sub>is heavier and more soluble than air) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimally-invasive-aortic-and-mitral-valve-surgery/abstract/8,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2016869730\"><span class=\"h1\">MINIMALLY INVASIVE AORTIC VALVE SURGERY (MI-AVR)</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3282360702\"><span class=\"h2\">Approaches</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For MI-AVR, the following alternatives to median sternotomy involve a 5 to 10 cm incision:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Partial upper (hemi or mini) sternotomy, most commonly referred to as a &quot;J&quot; incision into the right third or fourth intercostal space. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A superior sternal split approach (T incision into both right and left third or fourth intercostal spaces).

If femoral access is contemplated, peripheral vascular atheromatous disease needs to be routinely and carefully assessed and excluded preoperatively (by contrast enhanced computed tomography angiography or magnetic resonance angiography). Whereas central aortic cannulation, clamping, and subsequent repair are straightforward with partial (mini) sternotomy, these are more complex with limited anterolateral thoracotomy incisions so that more experience is needed for optimal outcomes with this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimally-invasive-aortic-and-mitral-valve-surgery/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiopulmonary-bypass-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiopulmonary bypass: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Venous cannulation (for drainage and in-flow into the CPB circuit) is usually accomplished directly through the operative field into the right atrium, although femoral cannulation (percutaneous or open) is possible to unclutter the restricted operative field. Adjunctive dynamic or vacuum drainage of the venous cannula is important to avoid incomplete venous drainage and right atrial distention through a smaller cannula that further limits view of the root and aortic valve. </p><p>Aortic cross clamping for cardioplegic arrest (to allow myocardial protection and a still operative field) is accomplished by direct external aortic cross clamping. It is more complex in reoperations performed through a limited anterior thoracotomy because of presence of adhesions, and endoaortic cross clamping (with a transcatheter balloon) can be considered as an alternative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimally-invasive-aortic-and-mitral-valve-surgery/abstract/8,25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,25-27</a>]. Cardioplegia for myocardial protection is administered antegrade via the root supplemented by retrograde delivery via the coronary sinus. Coronary sinus cardioplegia cannula placement is more complex, especially through a limited anterolateral thoracotomy approach but can be accomplished via a jugular approach with TEE or fluoroscopic guidance. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3268489254\"><span class=\"h2\">Outcomes for minimally invasive aortic valve surgery</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1456524540\"><span class=\"h3\">Primary aortic valve surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mortality and most major morbidities are comparable for conventional sternotomy and MI-AVR.

Given the small study samples and heterogeneity among studies, the evidence in this review was assessed as low to moderate quality. Moderate-quality evidence showed no significant difference in mortality rates with upper hemi-sternotomy or full median sternotomy. Postoperative blood loss was lower (mean difference [MD] -158.00 mL, 95% CI -303.24 to -12.76), intensive care unit stay was shorter (MD -0.57 days, 95% CI 0.93 to -0.20), and postoperative pulmonary function test was very slightly higher (MD 1.98 percent predicted FEV1, 95% CI 0.62-3.33) in the minimally invasive group. Similar cardiopulmonary bypass times and aortic cross-clamp times were seen in the upper hemi-sternotomy and full sternotomy groups, though evidence was low quality. Rates of postoperative atrial fibrillation, deep sternal wound infection, and re-exploration, as well as pain scores, postoperative ventilation times, and lengths of hospital stay were similar in the two treatment groups. </p><p>Meta-analyses including observational studies and randomized trials using propensity matching demonstrated modest improvements with MI-AVR in lengths of time on ventilator times (-2.1 hours), of intensive care unit stay (-0.46 days), of hospital stay (-0.9 days), and chest tube drainage in the first 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimally-invasive-aortic-and-mitral-valve-surgery/abstract/6,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,29,30</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3914335923\"><span class=\"h3\">Reoperative aortic valve surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Minimally invasive and full sternotomy approaches present differing benefits and risks in patients undergoing reoperation with prior aortic valve replacement <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG).

Full sternotomy also facilitates control of surgical grafts in patients with prior CABG (particularly a patent left internal mammary artery graft) and enhanced cardioplegic arrest.</p><p>Advantages of a minimally invasive approach in patients undergoing reoperation include reduction in surgical trauma and blood loss due to avoidance of lower mediastinal surgical dissection and potential injury to anterior cardiac structures during sternal reentry, especially patent CABG conduits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimally-invasive-aortic-and-mitral-valve-surgery/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>] and the right ventricle.

The latter technique requires repair of the iatrogenic atrial septal defect at the conclusion of the procedure and may be associated with transient atrial conduction abnormalities (commonly junctional rhythm) that typically resolve in days unless patients have underlying sinus node pathology. </p><p>MI-MVR techniques allow treatment of concomitant atrial fibrillation with either &quot;cut-and-sew&quot; or less invasive Maze procedure (cryo or radiofrequency ablation) with excellent outcomes and restoration of sinus rhythm. In addition, amputation of the left atrial appendage can further decrease thromboembolic risk but again is more technically challenging.

When clinically appropriate, coronary artery disease may be addressed with staged percutaneous coronary intervention.

A partial sternal split approach allows central aortic cannulation for cardiopulmonary bypass. A limited right thoracotomy incision or multiple smaller incisions for a robotic approach requires femoral arterial and venous cannulation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiopulmonary-bypass-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiopulmonary bypass: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Aortic cross clamping for the purpose of cardioplegic diastolic arrest is performed directly through the incision (transthoracic aortic clamping) with specially designed clamps or with endoaortic balloon occlusion. The endoaortic clamp has to be carefully monitored by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to prevent over-inflation (risk of rupture) or migration (distally, it can lead to cerebral malperfusion or proximally into the left ventricle). Direct aortic clamping is preferred whenever possible. </p><p>Myocardial protection and cardioplegia delivery are of increased importance, as cross clamp and pump times are longer (particularly earlier in the learning curve). Control of live grafts (such as left internal mammary artery graft) is much more challenging. In those circumstances, there is increased reliance on myocardial cooling and retrograde cardioplegia. Placement of cardioplegia catheters requires expertise with jugular vein access using TEE or fluoroscopy guidance, particularly in robotic MI-MVR surgery. Ventricular distention from aortic regurgitation is more challenging to deal with and may impair mitral valve visualization.</p><p>All minimally invasive nonsternotomy mitral valve surgical approaches require femoral cannulation.

Although the results demonstrate safety, there are scant under-powered randomized comparisons of conventional and alternative approaches to valve surgery with regard to clinical outcomes, postoperative complications, and cost. As with MI-AVR, growing clinical experience and large prospective nonrandomized registries have demonstrated that less invasive surgical approaches to the mitral valve can be performed with very low perioperative morbidity similar to conventional surgery with equivalent intermediate-term outcomes in appropriately selected patients when performed by experienced teams and surgeons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimally-invasive-aortic-and-mitral-valve-surgery/abstract/22,40-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,40-44</a>]. </p><p>A meta-analysis included seven studies (one randomized controlled trial and six retrospective studies with a total of 953 patients undergoing minimally invasive procedures and 1011 patients undergoing conventional sternotomy) comparing minimally invasive and conventional median sternotomy mitral valve repair for patients with degenerative valve disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimally-invasive-aortic-and-mitral-valve-surgery/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. There were no differences in mortality, stroke, renal failure, wound infection, re-exploration for bleeding, aortic dissection, myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation, or 30-day readmission rates. A minimally invasive approach was associated with longer pump and cross clamp times (relative risk 1.47, 95% CI, p&lt;0.001) and shorter intensive care unit stay (by relative risk 0.77, 95% CI, p = 0.01), but overall hospital stay was similar. Echocardiographic improvement (freedom from &gt;+2 mitral regurgitation) was also comparable (&lt;0.3 percent in both groups). </p><p>A meta-analysis of seven observational studies with a total of 523 patients undergoing MI-MVR and 731 undergoing conventional sternotomy mitral valve surgery also found no difference in early mortality or mitral valve repair rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimally-invasive-aortic-and-mitral-valve-surgery/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Cardiopulmonary bypass time was longer but the transfusion requirements were lower with minimally invasive surgery. The risk of stroke was lower (odds ratio 0.35; 95% CI, 0.15 to 0.82) in the minimally invasive group.</p><p>Although some studies have reported improvement in early pain scores with minimally invasive surgery compared with conventional sternotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimally-invasive-aortic-and-mitral-valve-surgery/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>], other meta-analyses demonstrated no differences in pain, ventilation times, transfusion, or hospital stays. In an observational study, elderly patients (age greater than or equal to 75 years) undergoing MI-MVR had shorter hospital stays and were more likely to be discharged to home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimally-invasive-aortic-and-mitral-valve-surgery/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p><br/>Intermediate-term (five-year) outcomes and freedom from reintervention were also comparable with MI-MVR and median sternotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimally-invasive-aortic-and-mitral-valve-surgery/abstract/43,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H456613256\"><span class=\"h3\">Reoperative mitral valve surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Very little data are available on outcomes of minimally invasive reoperative mitral valve surgery. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3549399954\"><span class=\"h1\">ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following are some of the evolving technologies that enable minimally invasive valve surgery. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2476019138\"><span class=\"h2\">Automated knot tying</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Newer, automated suturing instruments and enabling techniques have been developed to facilitate anchoring of aortic or mitral prosthetic valves as well as mitral annuloplasty rings.

Sutures secured with these devices were noted to be stronger, more consistent, and faster to perform compared with manually tied knots [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimally-invasive-aortic-and-mitral-valve-surgery/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2592578938\"><span class=\"h2\">Thorascopic and robotic technologies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Visualization of the mitral valve through smaller incisions can be enhanced by advanced thoracoscopic instruments that recreate three-dimensional (depth) stereoscopic visualization.

In contrast to transcatheter aortic valve replacement, this approach entails removal of all pathological leaflet and annular aortic valve calcification, thus facilitating implantation of a larger expandable prosthesis (to maximize effective orifice area and minimize potential of patient-prosthesis mismatch). Since no or minimal (one to three) guiding or anchoring sutures are needed, cross clamp times were dramatically reduced by 40 to 50 percent to less than 30 minutes, as were cardiopulmonary bypass times. The incidence of paravalvular leak and heart block requiring permanent pacemaker placement were similar to those of sutured surgical aortic valve replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/minimally-invasive-aortic-and-mitral-valve-surgery/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H402958275\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2173285591\" class=\"local\">'Possible advantages'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Current open cardiac surgical therapies, whether performed through a median sternotomy or alternative smaller incisions, continue to rely on cardiopulmonary bypass and a still operative cardiac field (myocardial cardioplegic arrest and protection). Much of the morbidity of open cardiac surgical interventions is related to the proinflammatory and anticoagulant effects of cardiopulmonary bypass, to aortic manipulation (cannulation, clamping, and de-clamping), and to myocardial protection during cardioplegic arrest. Thus, the potential benefit of minimally invasive aortic valve surgery approaches is limited. (See <a href=\"#H441040995\" class=\"local\">'Limitations'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limitations of MIVS approaches compared with traditional median sternotomy include a more restricted operative field; requirement of more preoperative imaging, evaluation, planning, and patient selection; and requirement of greater experience and expertise of the surgical team. (See <a href=\"#H441040995\" class=\"local\">'Limitations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The choice of a conventional or minimally invasive approach for a patient undergoing aortic or mitral valve surgery depends on patient factors as well as surgeon and institutional factors. (See <a href=\"#H157126600\" class=\"local\">'When to consider a minimally invasive approach'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Expert and experienced surgical, anesthesia, nursing, and perfusion teams are required to optimize the benefits and minimize the risks of surgery through limited incisions. This is even more critical for mitral valve repair since the likelihood of successful repair (versus replacement) varies significantly with both individual surgeon and institutional volumes. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A detailed patient assessment is required prior to aortic or mitral valve surgery to assess potential risks and benefits of available approaches and choose the optimum surgical approach. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minimally invasive aortic and mitral valve surgery techniques continue to evolve. When performed by experienced surgeons and centers, results are largely similar to those of open conventional surgery. Mortality and most major morbidities are comparable for MIVS and conventional sternotomy surgery with modest improvements in transfusion rates, hospital stay, and markedly enhanced patient satisfaction with MIVS.
