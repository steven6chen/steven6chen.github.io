HBV infection is a global public health problem. It is estimated that there are more than 250 million HBV carriers in the world, of whom approximately 600,000 die annually from HBV-related liver disease. Despite the availability of HBV vaccines, the rate of HBV-related hospitalizations, cancers, and deaths in the United States have more than doubled during the past decade.</p><p>The following topic review will summarize issues related to the management of HBV infection. The recommendations below are generally consistent with guidelines from the European consensus statement, Asian-Pacific consensus statement, and American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases Practice Guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-overview-of-management/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].

Treatment of acute HBV depends upon the clinical setting. However, appropriate measures should be taken to prevent infection in all exposed contacts, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-immune-globulin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hepatitis B immune globulin</a> and hepatitis B vaccine should be administered to all household and sexual contacts who are not known to be immune. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, transmission, and prevention of hepatitis B virus infection&quot;, section on 'Prevention'</a>.)</p><p>For most patients, treatment is mainly supportive. The likelihood of liver failure from acute HBV is less than 1 percent, and in immunocompetent adults, the likelihood of progression to chronic HBV infection is less than 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-overview-of-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. There are known subgroups of patients whose prognosis is relatively worse (eg, patients who are immunocompromised, have concomitant infection with hepatitis C virus [HCV], have pre-existing liver disease, or are older adults), but the role of antiviral therapy for such patients remains unsettled since few studies have addressed its benefits during acute infection.</p><p>As a general rule, we treat patients with a severe or a protracted course (eg, those who develop a coagulopathy [international normalized ratio (INR) &gt;1.5], those with persistent symptoms or marked jaundice [bilirubin &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL]</span> for more than four weeks after presentation). We also treat patients with acute liver failure due to HBV to reduce the likelihood of reinfection post-liver transplant.</p><p>For those who require treatment, tenofovir or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=entecavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">entecavir</a> are acceptable options given as monotherapy. Treatment can be stopped after confirmation that the patient has cleared HBsAg (two consecutive tests four weeks apart). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lamivudine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=telbivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">telbivudine</a> can also be used, as the duration of treatment is generally short. However, since severe exacerbations of chronic HBV in previously undiagnosed patients can be difficult to differentiate from acute HBV, tenofovir or entecavir are preferred. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adefovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Adefovir</a> is not typically used because of its weak antiviral activity, and interferon should be avoided because of the risk of bacterial infections and a further increase in hepatic necroinflammation in patients with severe hepatitis or acute liver failure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3341184351\"><span class=\"h1\">CHRONIC HEPATITIS B</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of chronic HBV infection is based upon the persistence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) for greater than six months.

However, liver stiffness can be influenced by inflammation as well as fibrosis, and therefore, liver stiffness measurements may over-estimate liver fibrosis in patients with a high ALT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-overview-of-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In addition, noninvasive assessments do not evaluate the activity of liver disease, which may be useful when determining the need for treatment. Thus, liver biopsy may be reasonable for patients who do not meet criteria for treatment, but have risk factors for developing fibrosis and inflammation, since patients with histologically active or advanced liver disease may benefit from treatment. (See <a href=\"#H3458586686\" class=\"local\">'Indications for antiviral therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We consider a biopsy for patients who are older than 40 or who have a family history of hepatocellular carcinoma, and have ALT levels that are mildly elevated (elevated but &lt;2 x upper limit of normal [ULN]) or have ALT levels that are normal but a viral load that is persistently elevated (eg, &gt;2000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> [10<sup>4</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL]</span> for HBeAg-negative patients or &gt;20,000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> [&gt;10<sup>5</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL]</span> for HBeAg-positive patients). A normal serum ALT level alone in patients with active viral replication does not predict mild or normal histologic findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-overview-of-management/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. As an example, one report found that up to 37 percent of patients with persistently normal ALT and HBV DNA levels &gt;10,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> (approximately &gt;2000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL)</span> had significant fibrosis and inflammation on liver biopsy. On subgroup analysis, most such patients had an ALT in the high range of normal and were older than 40 years of age. By contrast, two studies in patients in the immune tolerant phase of chronic HBV infection found that despite high HBV DNA levels, most patients had no or minimal fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-overview-of-management/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3458586686\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for antiviral therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision to initiate treatment is primarily based upon the presence or absence of cirrhosis, the ALT level, and the HBV DNA level (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F58520\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58520 \">table 5</a>). However, there are additional indications for patients with certain concurrent conditions, such as malignancy and pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H2133126708\" class=\"local\">'Patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3994433364\" class=\"local\">'Pregnant women'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3373095101\" class=\"local\">'Patients with hepatocellular carcinoma'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients who are not deemed to be treatment candidates at presentation, and those who decide to defer treatment, should undergo monitoring of liver biochemical tests, HBV DNA, and HBeAg status since liver disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> HBV replication may become active later. The frequency of monitoring is described in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F62875\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62875 \">table 4</a>).</p><p>Our approach is consistent with recommendations from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), which were updated in 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-overview-of-management/abstract/2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4</a>]. The AASLD, European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL), and Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver (APASL) guideline recommendations are very similar. However, there are minor differences related to the year of publication, the prevalence of HBV infection within the population, and the availability of resources [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-overview-of-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3065210357\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute liver failure or decompensated cirrhosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with life-threatening liver disease secondary to HBV should initiate antiviral therapy. This includes patients with acute liver failure (eg, fulminant acute HBV, severe exacerbation of chronic HBV), as well as those with decompensated cirrhosis and a detectable HBV DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay (regardless of the ALT level) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-overview-of-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Such patients should also be evaluated for liver transplant. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation for chronic hepatitis B virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Nucleos(t)ide analogue treatment has been shown to stabilize liver disease, and in some cases reverse liver failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-overview-of-management/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Antiviral treatment also reduces the risk of recurrent HBV should these patients require liver transplantation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-for-chronic-hepatitis-b-virus-infection#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation for chronic hepatitis B virus infection&quot;, section on 'Prevention of HBV reinfection'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3148217523\"><span class=\"h3\">Compensated cirrhosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with compensated cirrhosis and an HBV DNA &gt;2000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> (&gt;10<sup>4 </sup><span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL)</span> should be treated with antiviral therapy regardless of the HBeAg status or the serum ALT level (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F58520\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58520 \">table 5</a>). Treatment should be considered even if HBV DNA levels are lower than 2000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL,</span> since there are data showing that patients with cirrhosis and low HBV DNA levels have a higher risk of hepatocellular carcinoma than those with undetectable HBV DNA levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-overview-of-management/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1491214867\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients without cirrhosis</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2818821227\"><span class=\"h4\">HBeAg-positive (immune active phase)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For HBeAg-positive patients without cirrhosis, treatment should be initiated when the HBV DNA is &gt;20,000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> (&gt;10<sup>5</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL)</span> and the ALT is &gt;2 x ULN (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F58520\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58520 \">table 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-overview-of-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The ULN should be considered 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">U/L</span> for males and 19 <span class=\"nowrap\">U/L</span> for females; these levels should be used rather than individual laboratory cut-off levels. Treatment should be delayed for three to six months in newly diagnosed HBeAg-positive patients with compensated liver disease to determine whether spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion will occur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and natural history of hepatitis B virus infection&quot;, section on 'Phases of chronic HBV infection'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with chronic hepatitis whose serum ALT is persistently below 2 X ULN can be observed, considering treatment if and when the serum ALT becomes higher (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F62875\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62875 \">table 4</a>). Exceptions to this rule include: those who have recurrent hepatitis flares that fail to clear HBeAg, patients with icteric flares, those with active or advanced histologic findings (such as <span class=\"nowrap\">moderate/severe</span> inflammation or bridging <span class=\"nowrap\">fibrosis/cirrhosis),</span> patients with extrahepatic manifestations (eg, HBV-related polyarteritis nodosa), patients above the age of 40 who remain HBeAg-positive with persistently high HBV DNA levels, those with a family history of hepatocellular carcinoma (there is a lower threshold for HBV DNA and ALT in these patients), and health care providers performing exposure-prone procedures (as required by local guidelines). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection#H200090537\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, transmission, and prevention of hepatitis B virus infection&quot;, section on 'Healthcare providers'</a>.)</p><p>Although treatment can lead to virus suppression in HBeAg-positive patients with normal ALT, the likelihood of HBeAg seroconversion on treatment is low. The benefits of long-term treatment in such patients, most of whom are young Asians with perinatally acquired HBV infection, must be balanced against the risks of drug resistance, side effects, and costs, particularly since some of these individuals will undergo spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion and remain in remission for many years afterwards.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H761104648\"><span class=\"h4\">HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment may be initiated immediately once a diagnosis of HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis (ALT &gt;2 x ULN and HBV DNA &gt;2000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL)</span> is established because sustained remission is rare in the absence of treatment. However, delaying treatment for two to three months to allow patients to understand the disease, the need for long-term (and often lifelong) treatment, and the importance of adherence is reasonable in patients with no evidence of cirrhosis. We follow the AASLD recommendations that define the ULN for ALT as 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">U/L</span> for males and 19 <span class=\"nowrap\">U/L</span> for females, rather than using individual laboratory cut-off levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-overview-of-management/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>For those with an ALT &lt;2 x ULN, serial follow-up is needed to differentiate an inactive carrier state from HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis because of the fluctuating course of HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis. Liver biopsy should be considered in HBeAg-negative patients who have serum HBV DNA levels &gt;2000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> and normal or mildly elevated ALT to determine if treatment is warranted. Patients with low HBsAg levels (&lt;1000 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL)</span> are more likely to be in the inactive phase than those with higher HBsAg levels.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2133126708\"><span class=\"h4\">Patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antiviral therapy should be administered to most patients with chronic HBV prior to initiating immunosuppressive therapy, regardless of the HBV DNA or aminotransferase levels.

A sustained viral response, particularly in those who clear both HBeAg and HBsAg, is almost invariably accompanied by normalization of serum ALT, a decrease in necroinflammatory activity, and over time, a decrease in fibrosis as well. Antiviral treatment can also reduce the risk of long-term complications from chronic HBV (eg, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma) as well as the transmission of HBV to others. For some patients, immediate antiviral therapy is indicated, whereas for others, treatment may be deferred with careful monitoring.

It is estimated that there are more than 250 million HBV carriers in the world, of whom approximately 600,000 die annually from HBV-related liver disease. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of acute HBV infection is based upon the detection of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and IgM antibody to hepatitis B core antigen. For most patients, treatment is mainly supportive. The likelihood of liver failure from acute HBV is less than 1 percent, and in immunocompetent adults, the likelihood of progression to chronic HBV infection is less than 5 percent. However, preventive measures (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-immune-globulin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hepatitis B immune globulin</a> and hepatitis B vaccine) should be administered to all household and sexual contacts who are not known to be immune.

The management of chronic HBV infection is complex and depends upon multiple factors including clinical variables (eg, the presence or absence of liver inflammation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cirrhosis), the patient's immunologic response to infection (eg, hepatitis B e antigen [HBeAg]), virologic factors (eg, HBV viral load and genotype), and risk factors for disease progression (eg, age &gt;40, family history of hepatocellular carcinoma) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F62875\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62875 \">table 4</a>).

There are additional indications for patients with certain concurrent conditions, such as malignancy and pregnancy. Patients who are not deemed to be treatment candidates at presentation, and those who decide to defer treatment, should undergo monitoring of liver biochemical tests, HBV DNA, and HBeAg status since liver disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> HBV replication may become active later (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F62875\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62875 \">table 4</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H1024602452\" class=\"local\">'Choice of initial agent'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-and-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B and pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be monitored while on therapy to assess for virologic response and medication toxicity. Most patients receiving nucleos(t)ide analogue therapy will require at least four to five years of treatment, and some may require indefinite treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F58520\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58520 \">table 5</a>). (See <a href=\"#H760409998\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring on therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H34\" class=\"local\">'Duration and treatment endpoints'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of patients with persistent viremia or breakthrough infection depends upon the viral load and the antiviral agent that was used. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Tenofovir- or entecavir-resistant virus is unlikely to emerge in treatment-na&iuml;ve patients, and most cases of treatment failure are due to poor adherence. However, on rare occasion, a patient may need to be transitioned to an alternative agent. (See <a href=\"#H1736278503\" class=\"local\">'While receiving tenofovir or entecavir'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>By contrast, drug-resistant virus is likely to develop in patients failing therapy with nucleos(t)ide analogues, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adefovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adefovir</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=telbivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">telbivudine</a>. For patients with persistent viremia or breakthrough infection on one of these agents, we recommend tenofovir rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=entecavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">entecavir</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Tenofovir is effective in suppressing HBV replication in this setting, whereas entecavir should generally be avoided since there is a high risk of entecavir resistance developing in patients with pre-existing drug-resistant virus after lamivudine or telbivudine treatment. (See <a href=\"#H3919883343\" class=\"local\">'While receiving other nucleos(t)ide analogues'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with chronic HBV should receive counseling on ways to prevent worsening liver disease (eg, avoid alcohol use, hepatitis A vaccination) and to reduce transmission to others. In addition, screening for hepatocellular carcinoma is indicated for certain high-risk patients. (See <a href=\"#H40\" class=\"local\">'Counseling and prevention'</a> above and <a href=\"#H41\" class=\"local\">'Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-overview-of-management/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Sarin SK, Kumar M, Lau GK, et al.
