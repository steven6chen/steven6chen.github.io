Because of its rarity, the biology and clinical behavior, as well as the histopathologic features of pediatric melanoma, are not well characterized. The diagnosis is often extremely difficult to establish, especially in prepubertal children, in whom melanoma may present as a nonspecific, nonpigmented lesion or benign lesion, resulting in frequent misdiagnosis, thicker lesions, and delayed treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>This topic will discuss the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of melanoma in children.

Introduced by Sophie Spitz in 1948, it describes childhood melanocytic lesions with histologic features of melanomas but less aggressive clinical behavior compared with adult melanomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These lesions remain distinct from banal nevi and conventional melanoma and are now collectively regarded as Spitz tumors, a disease spectrum including benign Spitz nevi, spitzoid melanomas, and variants of uncertain malignant potential. These lesions are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spitzoid-melanocytic-neoplasms-spitz-nevus-and-atypical-spitz-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spitzoid melanocytic neoplasms (Spitz nevus and atypical Spitz tumors)&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H51145255\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26420266\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Melanoma is rare in individuals younger than 20 years, with an estimated annual incidence rate of nine per million in those aged 15 to 19 years, according to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Cancer Statistics Review 1975-2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Melanoma is even rarer in younger children, with estimated annual incidence rates of one, two, and three per million in the age groups 1 to 4, 5 to 9, and 10 to 14, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Lower incidence rates of pediatric melanoma have been reported among Hispanic and American Indian children &lt;19 years (2.1 and 3.3 per million individuals, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Due to the low incidence and lack of comprehensive registries, the precise incidence of clinical subtypes of pediatric melanoma, such as congenital and infantile melanoma, melanoma associated with congenital nevi, amelanotic melanomas, or spitzoid melanoma, is unknown.</p><p>Progressive increases in melanoma incidence in children have been reported in the United States over the last few decades, with approximately 90 percent of cases occurring among children older than 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-in-children/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>]. However, one study utilizing SEER&nbsp;data from 2000 to 2010 has reported the first decrease in age-adjusted incidence rates of melanoma in children and adolescents in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In this report, the decrease in incidence was most notable between 2003 and 2010 among adolescents aged 15 to 19 years. This finding is consistent with trends in Australia and Sweden, where reductions in pediatric melanoma incidence have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-in-children/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. This decrease may be related to improved awareness regarding melanoma, changes in sun protection practices, and scrutiny of indoor tanning. However, it cannot be excluded that the decreased incidence of pediatric melanoma may be in part due to the improved histopathologic and molecular classification of some benign lesions (eg, some Spitz nevi and proliferative nodules in giant congenital nevi) that in the past were overdiagnosed as melanomas. Ongoing data collection and analysis are necessary to determine the cause for this apparent decline and whether this trend will persist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26420118\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for adult melanoma are also significant for pediatric patients. They include genetic factors (eg, family history of melanoma, light phenotype, high nevus counts, congenital nevi, inherited DNA repair defects), environmental factors (eg, excessive exposure to sunlight, history of sunburns, indoor tanning), and iatrogenic or acquired immunosuppression. In a cohort of 70 pediatric melanoma patients, 40 percent had numerous nevi, 27 percent had a positive family history of melanoma, and 25 percent reported history of sunburn [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Other risk factors include hereditary retinoblastoma and Werner syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-in-children/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retinoblastoma-clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retinoblastoma: Clinical presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H400166901\"><span class=\"h2\">Melanoma arising in congenital nevi</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lifetime risk for development of melanoma within a small to medium-sized congenital nevus is less than 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Approximately one-half of these melanomas develop in the first decade of life. Children with large or giant congenital nevi (&gt;20 and &gt;40 cm adult diameter, respectively) have a slightly increased risk of developing melanoma, estimated to be approximately 2 to 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-in-children/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. &#160;</p><p>In a 2013 meta-analysis of 14 studies including 2578 patients with large congenital melanocytic nevi, melanoma developed in 51 patients (2 percent) at a mean age of 13 years (range 0 to 58 years), with a mortality rate of 55 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Most melanomas developed in giant congenital nevi or in large congenital nevi associated with multiple satellite nevi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>Of note, melanomas associated with congenital melanocytic nevi may arise in the central nevus system in a substantial proportion of cases or, less frequently, in other extracutaneous locations. In an analysis of a United Kingdom cohort of 448 children with congenital melanocytic nevi observed between 1988 and 2016, 12 children (2.7 percent) developed a melanoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Of these 12 primary melanomas, seven were primary melanomas of the central nervous system, two were primary cutaneous, one was primarily lymph nodal, and two were melanomas with unknown primary. The authors found that an abnormal screening magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the central nervous system in the first year of life in these patients was associated with a higher melanoma risk compared with a normal screening MRI (12 versus 2 percent, respectively). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-melanocytic-nevi#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital melanocytic nevi&quot;, section on 'Neurocutaneous melanosis'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26420254\"><span class=\"h2\">Congenital and infantile melanoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Congenital and infantile melanoma, defined as melanoma present at birth or developing in the first year of life, is exceedingly rare, with only a few cases reported in the literature. Reported cases and series suggest a male predominance and a predilection for the head and neck area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>In a retrospective review of 87 women with placental or fetal metastases, 27 cases were attributed to melanoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The fetus was affected in six cases, and five of six infants succumbed to disease. In one report of transplacental metastasis of terminal maternal melanoma, the infant experienced spontaneous regression of all lesions and was disease free at the time of the report publication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>There are no long-term follow-up data on unaffected children born to mothers with metastatic melanoma to exclude the possibility of a delayed presentation of the disease. However, neonates who do not present melanoma metastases at birth should be considered at high risk and undergo close clinical monitoring.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H51145261\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite sharing similar risk factors with adult melanoma, pediatric melanoma is considered to be biologically distinct from adult melanoma due to several distinctive features: greater thickness at presentation, higher frequency of amelanotic lesions, greater rate of sentinel node positivity, and overall less aggressive clinical course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Whether the greater thickness at presentation is due to delayed diagnosis or more rapid growth in children has not been determined.</p><p>Molecular testing has provided insights in the molecular pathogenesis of pediatric melanoma. The results of a study of whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing and targeted sequencing of 23 pediatric melanoma samples, including 15 conventional (superficial spreading and nodular) melanomas, 3 melanomas associated with congenital nevi, and 5 spitzoid melanomas, are summarized below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conventional melanomas were histologically similar to adult melanoma and similar to the adult counterpart that showed a high burden of somatic single-nucleotide mutations, of which over 80 percent were consistent with ultraviolet radiation damage. The activating <em>BRAF </em>V600 mutation was found in 13 of 15 patients (87 percent) and <em>TERT </em>promoter mutations in 12 of 13 patients. These tumors developed in adolescent patients from the ages of 10 to 20 years, with high mortality (10 of 15 patients).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All three melanomas associated with congenital nevi had <em>NRAS </em>(but not <em>BRAF</em> or <em>TERT</em> promoter)<em> </em>mutations, which is not surprising based upon the known <em>NRAS </em>mutant status of most large and giant congenital nevi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. These tumors had developed in children &lt;5 years, and all had a fatal outcome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two of the five spitzoid melanomas (from three preadolescent children, one adolescent, and one patient of borderline age, of whom one succumbed to disease) demonstrated kinase fusions but not <em><span class=\"nowrap\">BRAF/NRAS</em></span> mutations. In other reports, up to 40 percent have kinase fusions that include <em>NTRK1, NTRK3,</em> <em>MET</em>, <em>RET</em>, <em>ROS1</em>, <em>ALK</em>, and <em>BRAF</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-in-children/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p/><p>These findings suggest that conventional melanoma in adolescents is not different from adult melanoma. Although the clinical significance of the mutation pattern in melanomas associated with congenital nevi and in spitzoid melanomas is not clear, these melanomas appear to be distinct entities, with different clinical course and prognosis.</p><p>Congenital melanoma can arise de novo, in association with a congenital nevus, or from transplacental metastases from metastatic maternal melanoma. The pathophysiology of transplacental spread of melanoma is unclear. Factors involved may include the high vascularity of the placenta, placental production of angiogenic and growth factors, and impaired fetal immune response.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26420241\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation of melanoma in children often does not conform to the conventional ABCDE criteria (<strong>a</strong>symmetry, <strong>b</strong>order irregularities, <strong>c</strong>olor variegation, <strong>d</strong>iameter &ge;6 mm, <strong>e</strong>volving lesion) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F105746\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105746 \">picture 4B</a>). Especially in prepubertal children, melanoma may present as a symmetric, pigmented lesion with regular borders simulating a banal nevus; as a pink or reddish, symmetric, dome-shaped papule&nbsp;simulating a Spitz nevus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F105749\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105749 \">picture 1</a>); or as an amelanotic, nodular lesion simulating a pyogenic granuloma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F105751\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105751 \">picture 2</a>) or common wart. Lesions may be uniform in color and smaller than 6 mm. Most importantly, the &quot;evolving lesion&quot; criterion of the ABCDE rule is not as helpful in children and adolescents, in whom the onset of new nevi as well as lesion evolution (ie, increase in diameter and elevation) are the rule.</p><p>In a series of 70 children with melanoma, 60 percent of lesions in children &lt;11 years and 40 percent of those in adolescents lacked the conventional ABCDE criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Lesions were more likely to be small and amelanotic in young children and frequently uniform in color in adolescents, with lesion evolution being a nearly universal finding.</p><p>In a study of 52 pediatric melanoma cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], approximately 52 percent of lesions manifested the conventional ABCD criteria. However, the clinical morphology differed significantly between cases of spitzoid melanoma and nonspitzoid melanomas. While less than 25 percent of all cases of pediatric melanoma (spitzoid and nonspitzoid) fulfilled the modified ABCD criteria, 40 percent of the spitzoid and only 13.5 percent of nonspitzoid melanoma cases revealed the modified ABCD features. In contrast, almost 60 percent of nonspitzoid melanoma cases and only 33 percent of spitzoid melanoma cases had the conventional ABCD features. </p><p>In another study of 96 pediatric melanomas, the prebiopsy clinical diagnosis was a benign lesion in 40 of 68 cases (59 percent) and atypical nevus or melanoma in 28 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Forty-five percent of the tumors were amelanotic, and the most common presentation sign was a change in size and color. Pediatric melanomas that mimicked benign-appearing lesions were more likely to have a Breslow thickness &gt;1 mm (odds ratio 5.48, 95% CI 1.66-20.12).</p><p>The atypical appearance of pediatric melanomas can cause a diagnostic challenge, leading to a delay in diagnosis and thicker lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F105752\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105752 \">picture 3</a>). In one study, over 60 percent of the pediatric melanoma cases took approximately 12 months to establish the diagnosis, and, in keeping with the diagnostic delay, more than 90 percent of childhood cases and 50 percent of adolescent cases were diagnosed with stage IIa disease or higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-and-other-prognostic-factors-in-cutaneous-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor node metastasis (TNM) staging system and other prognostic factors in cutaneous melanoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H51145273\"><span class=\"h1\">DERMOSCOPIC FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dermoscopy has emerged as a useful tool to differentiate the morphology of various pediatric skin lesions that resemble melanoma. Evaluation using a dermatoscope is painless and well tolerated by children in the clinic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-in-children/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p>Ten melanoma-specific dermoscopic structures have been identified: atypical network, negative network, streaks, shiny white structures, atypical dots and globules, irregular blotch, blue-white veil, regression structures, peripheral brown structureless areas, and atypical vessels. The presence of at least 1 of these 10 structures should raise suspicion of melanoma. Since melanomas in children are often amelanotic, the examination of vascular structures is of primary importance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F79290\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79290 \">table 1</a>). Any nodular pink lesion with dotted vessels, milky red globules, or serpentine vessels should be considered suspicious for melanoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dermoscopic-evaluation-of-skin-lesions#H2297820\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dermoscopic evaluation of skin lesions&quot;, section on 'Melanoma: Global and local features'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dermoscopic-evaluation-of-skin-lesions#H610270\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dermoscopic evaluation of skin lesions&quot;, section on 'Vascular structures in skin lesions'</a>.)</p><p>An analysis of 49 dermoscopic images from 52 pediatric melanoma cases (mean age, range 2 to 20) found that the dermoscopic patterns most frequently associated with nonspitzoid melanomas were the multicomponent pattern and nevus-like pattern (58 and 25 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The multicomponent pattern is the &quot;classic&quot; dermoscopic melanoma patter &#160; &#160;n encountered in superficial spreading-type melanoma, with most cases presenting irregular globules, atypical network, blue-white veil, atypical vessels, and negative network. Spitzoid melanomas showed in most cases a &quot;vascular, pink, Spitz-like pattern&quot; with atypical vessels and shiny white structures or a &quot;pigmented, Reed-like&quot; pattern with black, blue-gray, and dark brown colors, peripheral streaks, and dark blotches. In this study, all cases of melanoma revealed at least one of the aforementioned melanoma-specific structures.</p><p>However, even in the absence of melanoma-specific structures and atypical vascular morphology, all lesions that do not manifest an unequivocal benign pattern and lesions that appear atypical should be considered for histopathologic examination. A useful approach may also include measurement, photography, and close clinical follow-up for evaluation of lesion evolution.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H51145285\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Not only are pediatric melanomas difficult to diagnose clinically, but they may also be challenging histopathologically. It can be difficult to distinguish a spitzoid type of melanoma from an atypical Spitz tumor because they have similar architectural and cytologic features, although the number and severity of atypical features are increased for melanomas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F105749\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105749 \">picture 1</a>). For example, a large lesion diameter (especially &gt;1 cm), increased mitotic rate (especially &gt;6 per mm<sup>2</sup>), and ulceration raise concern for malignancy in Spitz tumors. Moreover, there are pigmented tumors of uncertain malignant potential, and there are challenging pigmented lesions for which expert dermatopathologists cannot reach consensus on a diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-in-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spitzoid-melanocytic-neoplasms-spitz-nevus-and-atypical-spitz-tumors#H15767271\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spitzoid melanocytic neoplasms (Spitz nevus and atypical Spitz tumors)&quot;, section on 'Histopathology'</a>.)</p><p>Among pediatric melanomas, childhood tumors may show more aggressive histopathologic features than adolescent tumors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F105715%7EDERM%2F105746\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105715 graphicRef105746 \">picture 4A-B</a>), despite a paradoxically better survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A retrospective review of published fatal pediatric melanomas reported that childhood melanomas (up to age 10 years) are thicker than adolescent melanomas, with a mean Breslow thickness of 8.5 mm compared with adolescent melanoma mean Breslow thickness of 3.7 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Among patients with childhood melanoma associated with a congenital melanocytic nevus, the melanomas typically resided in the deeper dermis or subcutaneous fat.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H306101450\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of melanoma in children is challenging due to its rarity and often atypical clinical presentation. It requires a high index of suspicion based upon history, clinical, and dermoscopic findings, as well as a low threshold for the decision to perform a biopsy. The definitive diagnosis is reliant upon histopathologic evaluation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1775114\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A prominent feature in pediatric melanoma is lesion evolution over time. However, melanoma evolution in children may be misinterpreted as the expected and natural evolution of benign, pigmented lesions during childhood and adolescence. Patients or parents may report a history of bleeding, particularly for ulcerated lesions. Additional complaints may include pain, itch, or discomfort, all of which can prompt evaluation in the clinic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1775120\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In older adolescents and young adults, most melanomas are of the nonspitzoid variety, and most of these will manifest the conventional &quot;ABCDE criteria&quot; (<strong>a</strong>symmetry, <strong>b</strong>order irregularity, <strong>c</strong>olor variegation, large <strong>d</strong>iameter, <strong>e</strong>volving lesion). In contrast, melanomas in prepubertal and pubertal children are often spitzoid, and most of these will lack the conventional ABCD features. In addition, the &quot;evolving lesion&quot; criterion may not be helpful at an age in which the new <span class=\"nowrap\">onset/evolution</span> of common nevi is normal. Additional sets of pediatric criteria (the pediatric ABCD and the CUP criteria) have therefore been proposed to be used <strong>in combination with</strong> the conventional ABCDE rule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-in-children/abstract/11,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,31</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A = <strong>A</strong>melanotic</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>B = <strong>B</strong>leeding, <strong>b</strong>ump</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>C = <strong>C</strong>olor uniformity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>D = <strong>D</strong>e novo, any <strong>d</strong>iameter</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>C = <strong>C</strong>olor is <span class=\"nowrap\">pink/red,</span> <strong>c</strong>hanging</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>U = <strong>U</strong>lceration, <strong>u</strong>pward thickening</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>P = <strong>P</strong>yogenic granuloma-like lesions, <strong>p</strong>op-up of new lesions</p><p/><p>While these additional criteria may increase sensitivity for melanoma detection, they are <strong>not</strong> specific for melanoma.

Although nonpediatric patients were included in this cohort, the analysis found that homozygous 9p21 deletions were strongly associated with clinically aggressive behavior of the tumor; 6p25 or 11q13 chromosomal gains were also associated with aggressive clinical behavior. However, the role of homozygous 9p21 deletion as a marker of aggressive behavior remains controversial. In another study including 85 patients younger than 18 years with atypical spitzoid neoplasms, 17 were FISH-positive; of the nine FISH-positive patients with homozygous deletions in 9p21, only two experienced local recurrence or distant metastasis during a follow-up period of 3 to 89 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/melanoma-in-children/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].
