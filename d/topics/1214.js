Specific issues relating to management of common drug overdoses are discussed separately. (Refer to appropriate topic reviews.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H504092080\"><span class=\"h1\">BACKGROUND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Toxic exposures occur frequently in children throughout the world. Common patterns of pediatric poisoning consist of exploratory ingestions in children younger than six years of age and intentional ingestions and recreational drug use in older children and adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-occult-toxic-exposure/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In many instances, the toxic agent is readily identified. However, in an important minority of exposures, a history of poisoning is not provided.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation of occult ingestion varies depending upon the ingested substance and can range from asymptomatic to critically ill. Occult toxic exposure should be considered in the differential diagnosis of children who present with acute onset of multiorgan system dysfunction, altered mental status, respiratory or cardiac compromise, unexplained metabolic acidosis, seizures, or a puzzling clinical picture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-occult-toxic-exposure/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The index of suspicion should be raised if the child is in the &quot;at risk&quot; age group (one to four years of age) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> has a previous history of ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-occult-toxic-exposure/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Intentional etiologies for occult poisonings, including suicide attempts in older children and adolescents. Medical child abuse via forced ingestion in young children, particularly those who are younger than one year of age, must not be overlooked [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-occult-toxic-exposure/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=suicidal-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-risk-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Suicidal behavior in children and adolescents: Epidemiology and risk factors&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical child abuse (Munchausen syndrome by proxy)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Examples of medical child abuse by poisoning include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Forced ingestion or intentional poisoning of children is a form of child abuse that overlaps with Munchausen syndrome by proxy. A variety of substances, including water, salt, pepper, and various drugs (prescription and illicit), may be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-occult-toxic-exposure/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical child abuse (Munchausen syndrome by proxy)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Water intoxication from forced water drinking presents with hyponatremic seizures, vomiting, coma, or death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-occult-toxic-exposure/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Excessive water ingestion may be a &quot;punishment&quot; for perceived wrongdoing by the child or may be a component of medical child abuse. Signs of physical abuse often coexist and should be sought (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F109402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109402 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-child-abuse-recognition\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical child abuse: Recognition&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Salt poisoning typically presents in the first six months of life with unexplained hypernatremia, often recurrent. Salt is administered in milk or other liquids, usually by the mother; there is one report of salt administered via nasogastric tube [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-occult-toxic-exposure/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Salt poisoning may coexist with other unexplained recurrent illnesses if it is occurring in the context of medical child abuse (Munchausen syndrome by proxy). Serum sodium levels may be greater than 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L,</span> and urine sodium and chloride also are elevated. Renal and endocrinological evaluation is otherwise normal.

The possibility of concomitant trauma or illness must be recognized and addressed before initiation of decontamination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-occult-toxic-exposure/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-trauma-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of trauma in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The tempo, sequence, methods, and priorities of management are dictated by the toxin(s) involved, the presenting and predicted severity of poisoning, and the presenting phase of poisoning. Management always begins with stabilization of the airway, breathing, and circulation, and treatment of life- <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> limb-threatening trauma. It is then directed to the provision of supportive care, prevention of poison absorption, and when appropriate, administration of antidotes and enhancement of elimination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-occult-toxic-exposure/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL EVALUATION AND STABILIZATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rapid evaluation of mental status, vital signs, and pupils enables classification of the patient into a state of physiologic excitation (eg, central nervous system stimulation and increased temperature, pulse, blood pressure, and respiration); depression (depressed mental status and decreased temperature, pulse, blood pressure, and respiration); or mixed physiologic state. This initial characterization helps to direct initial stabilization efforts and provides a clue to the etiologic agent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71268\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71268 \">table 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-occult-toxic-exposure/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The airway of patients who have ingested an unknown substance must be monitored carefully. The patency of the airway should be evaluated in patients with central nervous system depression. Even those who are awake and talking on arrival must be monitored closely, because their condition can deteriorate quickly. The position of the head should be optimized to maintain airway patency. Endotracheal intubation should be performed in all patients in whom the airway is threatened. If intubation is necessary, cervical spine stabilization must be maintained if trauma is suspected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-endotracheal-intubation-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency endotracheal intubation in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-rsi-outside-the-operating-room-in-children-approach\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) outside the operating room in children: Approach&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-cervical-spinal-motion-restriction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric cervical spinal motion restriction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Breathing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After the airway is assessed and adequately secured, as needed, the quality of breathing must be evaluated. Poisoned patients may develop respiratory failure for many reasons (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69772\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69772 \">table 3</a>). Some toxins decrease the respiratory drive, whereas others impair muscle contraction; still other toxins may directly damage the lung parenchyma or result in pulmonary edema. Any of these mechanisms may result in hypoxia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypercapnia. In a symptomatic or rapidly deteriorating patient, measurement of arterial blood gas should be obtained. Supplemental oxygenation should be provided to maintain oxygen saturation &gt;95 percent. Intubation and ventilation are required in patients who cannot sustain adequate oxygenation or ventilation or who have severe acid-base disturbances. Intubation is sometimes necessary in patients with non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema or acute respiratory distress syndrome from toxins.

Blood pressure measurement and a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) should be obtained in all patients who present with occult toxic exposure. Continuous cardiac monitoring is often necessary.</p><p>The evaluation and management of circulatory compromise in patients with intoxication of unknown or multiple agents should occur according to Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) or Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) guidelines. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-perfusion-in-pediatric-resuscitation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of perfusion in pediatric resuscitation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-basic-life-support-for-health-care-providers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric basic life support for health care providers&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-drugs-in-pediatric-resuscitation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary drugs in pediatric resuscitation&quot;</a>.) </p><p>In certain toxidromes, (eg, monomorphic, wide complex tachycardias) it is important to recognize that deviations from ACLS protocols are necessary, because ACLS and PALS guidelines often are not toxicology-specific [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-occult-toxic-exposure/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

In addition, administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">naloxone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b1-thiamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">thiamine</a> should be considered in poisoned children and adolescents who are thought to have opiate intoxication or thiamine deficiency, respectively. In contrast, the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flumazenil-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">flumazenil</a> to reverse benzodiazepine ingestion is not routinely recommended because of potential serious adverse effects (eg, precipitation of seizures) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-occult-toxic-exposure/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypoxemia</strong> &ndash; Rapid evaluation of oxygenation should be performed in all patients with altered mental status. This can be performed with a bedside pulse oximeter <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> arterial blood gas measurement, which provides additional information about the patient's ventilation and acid-base status and may, in turn, affect diagnosis and management (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Ancillary studies'</a> below). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Pulse oximetry does not accurately reflect oxyhemoglobin saturation in patients with carbon monoxide poisoning. If carbon monoxide toxicity is a diagnostic consideration, the carboxyhemoglobin level should be measured by cooximetry using a blood gas sample. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbon-monoxide-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Carbon monoxide poisoning&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Pulse oximetry is also inaccurate (falsely low reading) in patients with methemoglobinemia and sulfhemoglobinemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F107546\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107546 \">table 7</a>).

An age-appropriate, concentrated dextrose solution must be administered if blood glucose is low, if the accuracy of the result is questioned, or in cases where rapid assessment of blood glucose is not available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-occult-toxic-exposure/abstract/2,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,20</a>]. The dose for dextrose is 0.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> administered intravenously or intraosseously. This is usually achieved with 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of 10 percent dextrose solution since extravasation of higher concentrations of glucose will lead to severe tissue damage.

Adolescents may also be exposed to occult toxins in the work or school environment (eg, alkaline corrosives, gases and fumes, cleaning agents, bleaches, various drugs, acids, and hydrocarbons) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-occult-toxic-exposure/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Paramedics can provide important information about open containers, empty bottles, spilled contents, drug paraphernalia, or suicide notes at the scene. If such items exist, the paramedics (or someone at the scene) should bring them to the hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-occult-toxic-exposure/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Unknown pills or chemicals may be identified by consultation with a regional poison control center (1-800-222-1222), computerized poison identification system, or product manufacturer (eg, material data safety sheet).</p><p>It is also important to know about interventions in the prehospital setting (eg, administration of oxygen, intravenous fluid, dextrose, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">naloxone</a>) since these may alter the patient's condition at the time of presentation.</p><p>Information about the quantity and timing of ingestion is helpful in making decisions about decontamination or the use of antidotes (see below). Younger children tend to ingest small quantities of single agents. In one study of 66 children (age 1.5 to 4.5 years), the volume of a &quot;mouthful&quot; was calculated by subtracting the volume of apple juice remaining in a cup after the child had taken one sip from the original volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-occult-toxic-exposure/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The mean volume of a mouthful was 9.3 mL (95% CI, 8 to 11 mL), with a range of 3.5 to 29 mL. In contrast to younger children, older children and adolescents, in whom the ingestion is more likely intentional, ingest larger quantities of multiple agents. In some cases, the only information that is available about the time of ingestion is the last time that the patient was observed to be doing well.</p><p>Information from the past medical history is useful in the identification of available medications, possible coingestants, baseline health status, and potential complicating factors (eg, G6PD deficiency). If the patient or family member cannot provide this information, it may be obtained from medical records, pharmacy profiles, or Medic-Alert bracelets.</p><p>Information from the social history may be useful in determining the circumstances, intent, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> agent of exposure. Unwitnessed, unintentional ingestions in young children tend to occur at times of decreased parental supervision (eg, when there are household visitors or holiday parties) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-occult-toxic-exposure/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>A history of illicit drug use in the patient or family members may provide a clue to the agent.

Toxicology screening is rarely necessary in children who have an unintentional ingestion and are asymptomatic or have clinical findings that are consistent with the history. It is indicated in children in whom the diagnosis of poisoning is uncertain, who have coma of unknown etiology, where there is suspicion of child abuse or Munchausen syndrome by proxy, and in whom the administration of an antidote depends upon the rapid identification of the toxic agent. Care should be taken to establish a chain of evidence for law enforcement purposes if intentional poisoning or Munchausen by proxy are suspected (this includes proper sealing, labeling, and storing of specimens to ensure that they cannot be tampered with). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical child abuse (Munchausen syndrome by proxy)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Urine screens provide qualitative data about the recent use of substances included in the screen. Urine screens usually test for a limited number of substances (typically drugs of abuse). Positive and negative immunoassay screens for drugs do not absolutely confirm or refute poisoning diagnoses and may need confirmation by gas chromatography-mass spectrophotometry (GC-MS). False positives may occur if structurally similar substances cross-react with the assay (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58181\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58181 \">table 22</a>). On the other hand, a negative screen may reflect a drug concentration below the threshold limit of detection because the specimen was obtained before or after peak concentration. Furthermore, the newer synthetic illicit drugs (such as cannabinoids, cathinones, opioids, and many others) will not be detected by routine drug of abuse screens. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=testing-for-drugs-of-abuse-doa#H192794595\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Testing for drugs of abuse (DOA)&quot;, section on 'False-negative results'</a>.)</p><p>Qualitative screens are inexpensive and provide rapid results (usually within one hour).

Serial testing might be necessary for agents with delayed absorption.</p><p>The interpretation of a single drug concentration for any drug must be made with caution because poisoning is a dynamic and rapidly changing process. Intervention may be required despite serum concentrations in the therapeutic range. Results of these tests should be considered in conjunction with the time of exposure.

The sooner decontamination is performed, the more effective it is at preventing poison absorption. Decontamination of poisoned children is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastrointestinal-decontamination-of-the-poisoned-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastrointestinal decontamination of the poisoned patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Activated charcoal has become the <strong>preferred method</strong> of GI decontamination in children. The use of activated charcoal is controversial in the asymptomatic patient. If activated charcoal is to be administered, voluntary ingestion in the alert and cooperative patient is preferred to nasogastric administration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastrointestinal-decontamination-of-the-poisoned-patient#H18993761\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastrointestinal decontamination of the poisoned patient&quot;, section on 'Activated charcoal'</a>.)</p><p>The clinical benefit of gastric lavage has not been confirmed in controlled studies, and its routine use in the management of poisoned patients is <strong>no longer recommended</strong> by the American Academy of Clinical Toxicology or the European Association of Poisons Centres and Clinical Toxicologists.

Antidotes reduce or reverse poison effects by a variety of means. They may prevent absorption, bind and neutralize poisons directly, antagonize end-organ effects, or inhibit conversion to more toxic metabolites. The pediatric doses for antidotes recommended for stocking in hospitals that accept emergency admissions are provided in the tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70409%7EPEDS%2F81720\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70409 graphicRef81720 \">table 27A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-occult-toxic-exposure/abstract/19,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21</a>].</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of the intoxicant and the antidote must be considered because the toxidrome may recur if the antidote is eliminated more rapidly than the ingested substance, particularly if the antidote acts by antagonizing end-organ effects or inhibiting conversion to toxic metabolites. As an example, somnolence and respiratory depression due to ingested opiates acutely reverse with the administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">naloxone</a> but recur in approximately one-third of cases because the elimination half-life of naloxone is only 60 to 90 minutes. (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=opioid-intoxication-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Opioid intoxication in children and adolescents&quot;</a>). Thus, in certain situations antidotes may require repeated administration or continuous infusion.</p><p>The risks and benefits of antidote administration also must be carefully weighed in the setting of multiple drug ingestion. Many antidotes (eg, antivenom, chelating agents, N-acetylcysteine) may be used concurrently without adverse effects. However, notable exceptions exist. When drugs that have opposite effects are taken at the same time, the reversal of one agent may unmask the toxicity of another. As an example, in a patient who ingested <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazepam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">diazepam</a> and cocaine, the administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flumazenil-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">flumazenil</a>, the benzodiazepine antidote, could lower the seizure threshold and increase the risk of serious complications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cocaine-acute-intoxication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cocaine: Acute intoxication&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, when drugs that have similar effects are co-ingested, the antidote may not seem to have any effect. This is a common problem when opiates are ingested with large amounts of ethanol. In such circumstances, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">naloxone</a> may be administered in such large amounts that it results in opiate withdrawal. For this reason, naloxone should be administered at lower doses in patients in whom there is a suspicion of opiate dependence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=opioid-withdrawal-in-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Opioid withdrawal in adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnostic trial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some cases, the clinical response to an antidote may suggest the etiology of poisoning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-occult-toxic-exposure/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].
