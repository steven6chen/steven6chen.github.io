Patients with ADHF represent a heterogeneous population with high post-discharge readmission rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-in-adults/abstract/1-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-13</a>]. The onset and severity of symptoms of ADHF vary and depend importantly on the nature of the underlying cardiac disease and the rate at which the syndrome develops. The largest proportion of patients (70 percent) with ADHF are admitted due to worsening chronic HF, up to 15 to 20 percent of patients present with HF for the first time, and approximately 5 percent are admitted for advanced or end-stage HF. A few patients with ADHF present with low blood pressure (&lt;8 percent) or shock (&lt;3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-in-adults/abstract/2,3,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,13</a>].</p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of ADHF will be reviewed here. The pathophysiology, etiology, and treatment of ADHF and the evaluation of the clinically stable patient with suspected HF are presented separately.

occur without known precipitant factors but more often occurs with one or more factors, such as infection, uncontrolled hypertension, rhythm disturbances, and nonadherence with drugs and diet.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For practical purposes, it is helpful to view the presentation of ADHF according to the predominant clinical characteristics on admission. As noted above, most patients presenting with ADHF have known chronic HF and may or may not have had a prior episode of decompensation. In many patients with chronic HF, symptoms have gradually worsened over the preceding days and weeks but have not been sufficient for the patient to seek medical attention. In a minority of patients, an episode of ADHF may be the first presentation of HF. </p><p>The following six clinical and hemodynamic profiles are modified from those described in the 2005 European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of ADHF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]: mild to moderate ADHF (de novo or as decompensation of chronic HF) with no hypertensive crisis or cardiogenic shock and no or mild to moderate pulmonary edema; hypertensive ADHF; ADHF with severe pulmonary edema; cardiogenic shock; high-output HF; and right HF. These clinical groups are not mutually exclusive (eg, a patient with hypertensive crisis or cardiogenic shock may develop severe pulmonary edema). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2020738267\"><span class=\"h2\">Mild to moderate ADHF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This syndrome is seen in patients with de novo HF or acute decompensation on chronic HF who develop mild to moderate signs or symptoms of decompensation; in this setting, there is no cardiogenic shock or hypertensive crisis. There may no, mild, or moderate pulmonary edema. This scenario accounts for greater than 70 percent of all HF admissions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. New onset HF is seen much less frequently (less than one-third of HF admissions) than decompensation of chronic HF but may present with the same phenotype. </p><p>Usual symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progressive dyspnea is the most common complaint of patients presenting with mild ADHF.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms of abdominal and peripheral congestion &ndash; Patients may report ankle swelling and epigastric tenderness or a sensation of abdominal fullness. Abdominal tenderness is often due to hepatic congestion and distention of the hepatic capsule. With severe hepatic congestion, the patient may also complain of nausea and anorexia. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other symptoms include nocturia and neurologic symptoms such as confusion, headaches, insomnia, anxiety, disorientation, and impaired memory.</p><p/><p>Physical signs:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vary according to the severity of fluid overload HF. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs of congestion &ndash; An elevated jugular venous pressure, positive hepatojugular reflux test, and a tender, enlarged liver are frequent findings in these patients. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Diminished air entry at the lung bases is usually caused by a pleural effusion, which is often more frequent in the right pleural cavity than in the left. Rales (crackles) and wheezing may or may not accompany signs of pleural effusion. An absence of rales does not imply lack of pulmonary venous pressure elevation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Leg edema is frequently evident in both legs, particularly in the pretibial region and ankles in ambulatory patients. Sacral edema can be detected in patients who are bedridden.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac examination &ndash; This may be entirely normal in patients with HF secondary to diastolic dysfunction, whereas many patients with advanced systolic dysfunction exhibit a third heart sound and a laterally displaced apex beat. A murmur of mitral regurgitation is often audible when the left ventricle (LV) is markedly enlarged, or a tricuspid regurgitation murmur is present when the right ventricle is volume or pressure overloaded. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest radiograph in this setting may show cardiomegaly. Some patients have evidence of pleural effusion and redistribution of blood flow from bases to the upper lobes. There may or may not be evidence of interstitial edema. (See <a href=\"#H1424221704\" class=\"local\">'Chest radiograph'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1246074216\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypertensive ADHF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The syndrome of hypertensive ADHF is characterized by the rapid onset of symptoms or signs of HF. Hypertensive ADHF accounts for approximately 10 percent of ADHF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertensive ADHF has been defined as rapid onset of HF with systolic blood pressure &gt;140 mmHg; the presenting systolic blood pressure is frequently &gt;180 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This presentation is predominantly a condition of older adults, particularly women. Patients with this condition frequently have a history of poorly controlled hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. There is usually predominant pulmonary rather than systemic congestion as is manifest by minimal weight gain prior to admission. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Virtually all patients have a preserved LV ejection fraction. Blood pressure elevation could develop rapidly and is associated with increased filling pressures and enhanced sympathetic tone. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2707826542\"><span class=\"h2\">ADHF with severe pulmonary edema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary edema has been observed in 15 percent or more of patients admitted with ADHF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], but severe pulmonary edema is seen in less than 3 percent of these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients typically experience a sudden and overwhelming sensation of suffocation and air hunger; this is invariably accompanied by extreme anxiety, cough, expectoration of a pink frothy liquid, and a sensation of drowning. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient sits bolt upright, is unable to speak in full sentences, and may thrash about. The respiratory rate is increased, the alae nasi are dilated, and there is inspiratory retraction of the intercostal spaces and supraclavicular fossae. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiration is often noisy, and there may be audible inspiratory and expiratory gurgling sounds. An ominous sign is obtundation, which may be a sign of severe hypoxemia. Sweating is profuse, and the skin tends to be cool, ashen, and cyanotic, reflecting increased sympathetic outflow.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pulse rate is most often elevated secondary to an increased adrenergic drive. When the blood pressure is found to be markedly elevated, it is more likely to be the cause of, or an important contributing factor to, pulmonary edema rather than the consequence of the condition. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The oxygen saturation is usually less than 90 percent of room air before treatment. Auscultation of the lungs usually reveals coarse airway sounds bilaterally with rhonchi, wheezes, and moist fine crepitant rales that are detected first at the lung bases but then extend upward to the apices as the lung edema worsens. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac auscultation may be difficult in the acute situation, but third and fourth heart sounds may be present. When valvular abnormalities <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mechanical complications after myocardial infarction result in ADHF, the murmurs of mitral and aortic regurgitation and ischemic ventricular septal defect are often audible, but detection requires a careful and skillful auscultator. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of cardiac murmurs in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The chest radiograph may show cardiomegaly, upper zone redistribution of blood flow, interstitial edema (with ill-defined vessels, peribronchial cuffing, and interlobular septal thickening), and alveolar edema (with perihilar and lower-lobe airspace filling, with the periphery generally spared in the mid and upper lung zones) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1424221704\" class=\"local\">'Chest radiograph'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1351061335\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiogenic shock</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systolic blood pressure is less than 90 mmHg in approximately 8 percent of patients with ADHF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-in-adults/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low-output HF is characterized by symptoms and signs that are related to decreased end-organ perfusion. A typical patient with this clinical syndrome has severely impaired LV function and usually presents with symptoms of fatigue, altered mental status, or signs of organ hypoperfusion such as prerenal azotemia or abnormal hepatic enzymes. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient may present with tachypnea at rest, tachycardia, and a cold and cyanotic periphery with poor capillary refill. The degree of peripheral hypoperfusion may be so advanced that the skin over the lower extremities is mottled and cool.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A diminished pulse pressure, consistent with a reduced stroke volume, is often found in patients with this syndrome. Occasionally, the clinician may detect pulsus alternans: when a strong or normal pulse alternates with a weak pulse during normal sinus rhythm. This physical finding is rare but, when present, is a sign of severe LV dysfunction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=examination-of-the-arterial-pulse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Examination of the arterial pulse&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=examination-of-the-arterial-pulse#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Examination of the arterial pulse&quot;, section on 'Pulsus alternans'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A subset of patients with decompensated end-stage HF present to the emergency department in occult shock and may be difficult to distinguish from patients with mildly decompensated chronic HF and stable HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The only parameter differentiating occult shock patients from nonshock patients is a significantly elevated lactic acid level. Therefore, we suggest checking a lactic acid level in patients who present with marked weakness <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> uncertain peripheral perfusion. (See <a href=\"#H1828327839\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory data'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is imperative to rapidly delineate the cardiac causes of shock. After an acute coronary syndrome has been excluded, echocardiography should be done as soon as possible to exclude cardiac tamponade and further characterize left and right ventricular function and the integrity of the left-sided valves.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H419292502\"><span class=\"h2\">High-output heart failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This phenotype is an uncommon cause of ADHF and generally presents with warm extremities, pulmonary congestion, tachycardia, and a wide pulse pressure. Underlying conditions include anemia, thyrotoxicosis, advanced liver failure, and skeletal conditions such as Paget disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-pathophysiology-of-high-output-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and pathophysiology of high-output heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2185631845\"><span class=\"h2\">Right-sided heart failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This syndrome of predominantly right-sided HF occurs commonly in patients with severe isolated tricuspid regurgitation, right ventricular dysfunction, and chronic lung disease, such as those with chronic obstructive lung disease, interstitial lung disease, or long-standing pulmonary hypertension. These patients are often oxygen dependent and present with signs and symptoms of right-sided volume overload. Pulmonary embolism as an acute cause of dyspnea and right HF should be excluded.

Most importantly, intermittent myocardial ischemia can cause severe but transient reduction in LV compliance, accompanied by an elevation in the LV filling pressure. Because of the change in ventricular compliance, this elevation in pressure may or may not be accompanied by an elevation in the LV volume. Furthermore, if the wedge pressure is first measured after the ischemia has resolved (and if LV function has improved), a relatively normal value may be obtained, leading to the erroneous conclusion that the respiratory distress was caused by noncardiogenic mechanisms.</p><p>On the other hand, an elevated wedge pressure does not exclude the possibility of noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. It is estimated that as many as 20 percent of patients with pulmonary edema due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have concomitant LV dysfunction. The contribution of ARDS to the pulmonary edema requires monitoring the wedge pressure response to treatment. Noncardiogenic factors are probable if the pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxemia do not improve appreciably within 24 to 48 hours after normalization of the wedge pressure.

Establishing the diagnosis may depend upon the characteristics of the electrocardiogram (ECG) and the differences in appearance of typical chest radiograph findings in the two conditions.

Chest radiograph findings may differ, but some cases of bibasilar pneumonia may be similar to HF, although evidence of upper zone redistribution is not present with pneumonia. Fever and leukocytosis may suggest an infectious process. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to community-acquired pneumonia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asthma &ndash; Reactive airways disease can cause acute shortness of breath, cough, and fatigue. In addition, patients with ADHF may present with wheezing that can simulate asthma. The chest radiograph can be helpful in differentiating these conditions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-asthma-in-adolescents-and-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of asthma in adolescents and adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema (NCPE) &ndash; NCPE is invariably associated with an underlying disease, which may or may not be readily apparent. The diagnosis of NCPE often depends on pretest probabilities: acute respiratory distress in a patient with documented sepsis (ie, peritonitis) or pancreatitis should raise the strong possibility that the respiratory failure is due to NCPE. In contrast to cardiogenic pulmonary edema (CPE), NCPE is uncommonly associated with a well-defined acute cardiac event (ie, MI). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Subtle physical signs may also aid in differentiating NCPE from CPE. NCPE is usually a hyperdynamic illness, clinically apparent as a warm, vasodilated periphery, whereas CPE is frequently associated with a cold and sweaty periphery. Tachycardia is frequently present with NCPE or CPE. The findings of a third heart sound or murmurs of aortic and mitral regurgitation and aortic stenosis suggest a cardiogenic cause of pulmonary edema. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">ST segment changes on ECG consistent with MI or myocardial ischemia would suggest an acute cardiac event as the cause of the pulmonary edema. Also, ECG evidence of left ventricular strain, left bundle branch block, or other abnormalities of the QRS complex might indicate an underlying cardiac pathology. By contrast, the ECG is usually normal in patients with NCPE, unless there are major metabolic disturbances.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In NCPE and CPE, arterial hypoxemia is due to changes in the ventilation-perfusion ratio and in the extent of intrapulmonary shunting. Patients with NCPE usually have a more pronounced defect in oxygenation than is seen in patients with CPE, largely due to the greater shunt fractions found in these patients. Higher concentrations of inspired oxygen concentrations (FiO<sub>2</sub>) and larger positive end-expiratory pressures are often required to achieve acceptable oxygenation in NCPE compared with CPE.

The type and level of monitoring required for any individual patient vary widely depending on the severity of the cardiac decompensation and the response to initial therapy. Generally, the following parameters should be measured in all critically ill patients: mental status, blood pressure, temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate, and urine output. Some laboratory tests should be monitored by repeated testing (eg, electrolytes, creatinine, glucose). Liver function tests and lactate levels should be measured when there is evidence of hypoperfusion. Arterial blood gas analysis is generally routinely required but is indicated in patients with hypoxia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> respiratory failure. After admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) or a step down unit, patients with ADHF should be carefully monitored to ensure that the treatment goals are met and continued progress is made toward a stable state.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H550898120\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical predictive models</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of mortality prediction models for ADHF have been developed and validated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-in-adults/abstract/37-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-42</a>].

HF may be new or an exacerbation of chronic disease. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with ADHF can be categorized into one or more of the following six clinical profiles: mild to moderate ADHF (de novo or as decompensation of chronic HF); hypertensive ADHF; ADHF with severe pulmonary edema; cardiogenic shock; high-output HF; and right HF. These clinical groups are not mutually exclusive (eg, a patient with hypertensive crisis or cardiogenic shock may develop severe pulmonary edema). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial assessment of ADHF should include a brief, focused history and a physical examination to evaluate signs and symptoms of HF as well as potential causes and precipitants. The diagnostic workup should occur in parallel with steps to characterize the patient's cardiopulmonary status and to initiate appropriate management to stabilize patients in a timely manner. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Appropriate therapy for ADHF requires appropriate identification of the specific ADHF phenotype as well as the potential causes and precipitants. Causes are the primary condition or disease process leading to the development of HF. Precipitants are triggers or contributing factors for decompensation in patients with established chronic heart disease. (See <a href=\"#H3761618367\" class=\"local\">'Causes and precipitating factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of ADHF is a clinical diagnosis based upon the presence of a constellation of symptoms and signs of HF. While test results (eg, natriuretic peptide level, chest radiograph, echocardiogram) are often supportive, the diagnosis cannot be based on a single test. (See <a href=\"#H3915189196\" class=\"local\">'How to diagnose ADHF'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal pro-BNP (NT-proBNP) assays can supplement clinical judgment when the cause of a patient's dyspnea is uncertain, particularly among patients with an intermediate probability of HF. Most dyspneic patients with HF have plasma BNP values above <span class=\"nowrap\">400&nbsp;pg/mL</span>. For patients &lt;50, 50 to 75, and &gt;75 years of age, the optimal plasma NT-proBNP cutoffs for diagnosing HF are 450, 900, and 1800 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL,</span> respectively. The natriuretic peptide concentration should not be interpreted in isolation but in the context of all available clinical data bearing on the diagnosis of ADHF. (See <a href=\"#H3424121921\" class=\"local\">'Natriuretic peptide levels'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine use of invasive hemodynamic monitoring in patients with ADHF is <strong>not</strong> recommended. However, invasive hemodynamic monitoring is indicated in patients who are in respiratory distress or have clinical evidence of hypoperfusion in whom clinical assessment cannot adequately determine intracardiac filling pressures. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Swan-Ganz catheter'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urgent or early coronary angiography and intervention is indicated in patients with ADHF and an acute coronary syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Coronary angiography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of ADHF includes other causes of acute respiratory distress such as pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, and asthma.
