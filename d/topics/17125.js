The use of a chaperone for the examination of the anorectal and genital areas of adolescent patients should be a shared decision between the patient and the clinician after the clinician has explained the reason for the examination and described how the examination will proceed. The sex of the chaperone should be determined by the patient's wishes and comfort (if possible). If a patient is offered the use of a chaperone and declines, this should be documented in the chart.</p><p>The physical findings and approach to examination of the genitourinary system depend upon the age and sex of the patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Males</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Neonates</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The neonatal examination should focus upon congenital anomalies. Attention should be paid to penile length (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66323\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66323 \">figure 1</a>), foreskin anatomy, location of the urethral meatus, scrotal anatomy (including rugae), the presence and location of the testes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51355\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51355 \">picture 1</a>), and the presence of abnormal scrotal or inguinal masses. The precipitation of uric acid crystals in the diaper (secondary to increased urinary uric acid excretion in infants) may be misidentified as blood (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65328\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65328 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p>The tightly adherent foreskin should be gently retracted to reveal the urethral meatus in its normal anatomic position at the tip of the glans penis. Forceful retraction is never indicated, particularly in the infant. Care of the uncircumcised penis is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=care-of-the-uncircumcised-penis-in-infants-and-children#H9377172\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Care of the uncircumcised penis in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Routine care and hygiene'</a>.)</p><p>A hooded foreskin and chordee generally are present if the urethral meatus is found on the ventral surface proximal to the glans (hypospadias) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58046\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58046 \">picture 3</a>). Epispadias is diagnosed when the urethral meatus is found on the dorsal surface of the penis. Additional evaluation and management of infants with hypospadias are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypospadias-pathogenesis-diagnosis-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypospadias: Pathogenesis, diagnosis, and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Attention to the development of scrotal rugae helps determine the gestational age of male neonates. Poorly developed shallow rugae are found in significantly preterm infants. Fully developed deep rugae are evident in the term infant.</p><p>The clinician's hands and fingers must be in the proper position for an appropriate examination of the scrotum to identify the testes and other normal and abnormal masses. Ideally, the index finger <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> middle finger of the examining hand are placed over the posterior aspect of the scrotum, with the thumb of that hand positioned over the anterior aspect of the scrotum. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=undescended-testes-cryptorchidism-in-children-clinical-features-and-evaluation#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Undescended testes (cryptorchidism) in children: Clinical features and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Examination'</a>.)</p><p>If the scrotal sack is empty, each inguinal canal should be examined for retained testicular tissue. The neonate should be in a supine position. With the index and middle finger of the examining hand positioned over the inguinal canal, the examiner should palpate the length of the canal and attempt to gently express any retained testicular tissue into the scrotum. At the same time, the middle finger, index finger, and thumb of the opposite hand should be properly positioned to palpate the ipsilateral proximal scrotum for any testicular tissue entering from the inguinal canal.</p><p>Even if previous examinations have revealed the presence of scrotal testes, it is important to reexamine the scrotum at each subsequent well child visit. Some boys have palpable testes in the scrotum on one visit, but months to years later the examination reveals that the testes have spontaneously ascended into the inguinal canal or into an intra-abdominal position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-the-perineum/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The evaluation and treatment of undescended testes is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=undescended-testes-cryptorchidism-in-children-management#H169948\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Undescended testes (cryptorchidism) in children: Management&quot;, section on 'Management of undescended testes'</a>.)</p><p>Occasionally, palpation of the scrotum reveals unilateral or bilateral fullness in addition to the normally palpable testis. Transillumination of the area using a narrow-beam, bright-light source frequently reveals either a fluid-filled hydrocele or an indirect inguinal hernia. Hydroceles generally spontaneously regress during the first 12 to 18 months of life. Occasionally, they are accompanied by hernias, sometimes making it difficult to distinguish between the two. Hernias usually fill the inguinal area and the upper two-thirds of the scrotum, whereas hydroceles may be confined to the scrotal area alone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inguinal-hernia-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inguinal hernia in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inguinal-hernia-in-children#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inguinal hernia in children&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Older infants and children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although genitourinary examination of the older infant and toddler requires the same meticulous evaluation as does that of the neonate, the findings may be somewhat different. If the examiner has difficulty palpating scrotal testes, the patient should be placed in a sitting knee-chest position to help force the testes into a dependent position. Testicular palpation may be enhanced further by having the patient assume that same position in a warm tub of water.</p><p>Penile length should be assessed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77025\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77025 \">figure 2</a>). The foreskin of an uncircumcised penis may be difficult to retract. Fusion of the inner epithelium of the prepuce and the epithelium of the glans accounts for the nonretractability. After the first few years of life, squamous cells eventually keratinize, and the prepuce separates from the glans, allowing for normal retraction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=care-of-the-uncircumcised-penis-in-infants-and-children#H86214258\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Care of the uncircumcised penis in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Benign conditions'</a>.)</p><p>Occasionally, the glans becomes traumatized or infected, producing erythema and swelling (balanitis). Foreskin that has been forcibly retracted and not returned to its normal anatomic position may create a ligature around the penile shaft (paraphimosis) that requires immediate medicosurgical intervention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=care-of-the-uncircumcised-penis-in-infants-and-children#H172410326\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Care of the uncircumcised penis in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Pathologic conditions'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Preadolescent and adolescent males</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Accurate adolescent Tanner (also known as Sexual Maturation Rating) score is determined by assessing penile and testicular size and the extent of pubic hair development (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F76165\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76165 \">table 1</a>). As the male approaches adolescence, at an average age of 11 to 12 years, the first sign of pubertal onset is testicular enlargement (Tanner stage 2) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80005\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80005 \">picture 4</a>). In addition to testicular growth at this stage, pubic hair becomes evident, at first long and straight and later curling (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80005\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80005 \">picture 4</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-puberty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal puberty&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Testicular length before puberty is normally 1.5 to 2 cm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76651\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76651 \">table 2</a>). Testicular length can be determined using a measuring tape or calipers; alternatively, testicular size and volume can be determined with the use of orchidometer beads. When testicular growth is questionable, ultrasound measurements should be obtained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-the-perineum/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Although somewhat smaller than the right testicle, the left testicle tends to be positioned lower in the scrotum.</p><p>Penile enlargement begins in stage 2 and continues through stage 5. Accurate measurement of penile length is best achieved by using a ruler, retracting the pubic fat away from the proximal shaft, and stretching the penis to its full length. By Tanner stage 4, pubic hair becomes more abundant, spreading to involve the symphysis pubis and eventually the thighs. Delayed onset of male puberty generally is attributable to constitutional delay and warrants close follow-up.</p><p>Examination of the adolescent male should include visualization of the urethral meatus for any discharge and the penile and scrotal skin for unusual lesions. The clinician also should palpate the scrotum for testicular position, hernias, and abnormal masses (such as a varicocele). The normal testicular surface feels smooth; an adjacent varicocele feels like a clump of worms. Most varicoceles collapse when the patient assumes a supine position. Adolescent varicoceles (dilatation of spermatic cord veins) can be detected more frequently if the patient is examined while standing. Testicular self-examination is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-testicular-cancer#H944569883\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for testicular cancer&quot;, section on 'Limitations and potential harms of testicular examination'</a>.)</p><p>In addition to examining the genitalia, the clinician should inspect the perianal area for fissures, hemorrhoids, or abnormal lesions. If any abnormal findings are present, the adolescent should be appropriately informed and counseled. Normal findings also should be communicated to the patient, particularly to those who have been somewhat apprehensive during the examination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Females</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Neonates and infants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genitourinary examination of female neonates requires careful inspection of anatomic structures. Proper visualization should be done with the infant in a supine position, legs flexed and abducted at the hips.</p><p>Normally, no visible distinction is found between the labia majora and labia minora in the young girl. Gentle separation of the labia will reveal the clitoris, vaginal introitus, and urethral meatus. If the clitoris is large and posterior labial fusion is noted, virilization secondary to congenital adrenal hyperplasia should be ruled out. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the infant with atypical genitalia (disorder of sex development)&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>Inferior to the clitoris is the urethral meatus and, inferior to it, the vaginal introitus. Patency of the vaginal introitus should be established. Many infants have vaginal tags, which are of no significance and eventually spontaneously regress. In the first few days after birth, a transient, blood-tinged, mucoid vaginal discharge may be seen secondary to maternal estrogen withdrawal. The precipitation of uric acid crystals in the diaper (secondary to increased urinary uric acid excretion in infants) may be misidentified as blood (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65328\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65328 \">picture 2</a>). A unilateral soft tissue mass in the inguinal or labial areas may represent a direct inguinal hernia.</p><p>Similar to neonates, female infants and toddlers are best examined in the supine position with the legs abducted at the hips. Gentle posterolateral retraction of the skin surrounding the inferior vulvar rim provides optimal visualization. Anatomically and physiologically, generally little change occurs in this area from the time of birth.</p><p>Occasionally, a thin tissue membrane adherent to labial skin (labial adhesions or agglutination) but not impeding urethral flow will obscure visualization of the underlying vulvar anatomy. This membrane may develop as a result of poor hygiene. Management of this condition consists of instructions to the caregivers regarding appropriate cleansing of the area <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> daily application of a thin layer of estrogen cream for two to three weeks. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-vulvovaginal-complaints-in-the-prepubertal-child#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of vulvovaginal complaints in the prepubertal child&quot;, section on 'Labial adhesions'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Older females</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician must understand individual sensitivity issues regarding the genitourinary examination of the older child. The admonition from parents, teachers, and guardians that a child should not allow anyone to see or touch her private areas without her permission causes some children to become apprehensive and uncooperative. Thus, the clinician who is about to begin an examination of the genitalia should explain to the patient why examination of the area is needed and how the examination will be performed, including what instruments, if any, will be used. Appropriate gowning <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> covering should be provided. Careful attention should be given to making sure the procedure is painless.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Preadolescent and adolescent females</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genital examination of the preadolescent female is best conducted with the patient either in the supine position with legs in a frog-like position, flexed and abducted at knees and hips, or with the patient prone in a knee-chest position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F75858\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75858 \">picture 5</a>). Vaginal mucosa in the preadolescent is thin, moist, and somewhat red. The examiner should look for any signs of trauma, irritation, or discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-the-perineum/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In early puberty, a normal watery, nonfoul-smelling vaginal discharge may be present. The presence of blood, purulent discharge, or foul odor requires investigation. Evidence of trauma or blood should raise the possibility of sexual abuse. In the younger child with genital blood or foul odor, the examiner should consider the possibility of a vaginal foreign body. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-sexual-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of sexual abuse in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-vulvovaginal-complaints-in-the-prepubertal-child#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of vulvovaginal complaints in the prepubertal child&quot;, section on 'Foreign body'</a>.)</p><p>Clitoral size should be determined by the clitoral index, a measurement expressed in square millimeters and calculated from the product of the length and width of the clitoris; charts indicating the normal clitoral index by age are available. Causes of androgen stimulation, including congenital adrenal hyperplasia and abnormal karyotype (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78311\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78311 \">table 3</a>), should be sought when measurements indicate clitoral enlargement for age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-the-perineum/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-infant-with-atypical-genitalia-disorder-of-sex-development#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the infant with atypical genitalia (disorder of sex development)&quot;, section on 'Initial evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Unusual soft tissue masses may be seen in the vulvar area in preadolescent females. An edematous, violaceous, nontender, donut-shaped mass may be noted surrounding the urethral meatus, particularly in black females younger than age 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-the-perineum/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. This abnormality is the result of urethral prolapse with eversion of the mucosa through the external meatus. Bleeding from this area may be the presenting complaint. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-vulvovaginal-complaints-in-the-prepubertal-child#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of vulvovaginal complaints in the prepubertal child&quot;, section on 'Urethral prolapse'</a>.)</p><p>A lesion found predominantly in white preadolescent girls is a prolapsed ectopic ureterocele, which protrudes through the urethral meatus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-the-perineum/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Other vulvar lesions include paraurethral cyst, imperforate hymen (leading to hydrocolpos or hydrometrocolpos), and rarely a grapelike cluster (caused by sarcoma botryoides) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-the-perineum/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>Generally, the first sign of puberty (Tanner stage 2) for girls is breast development (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F55329\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55329 \">table 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72038\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72038 \">picture 6A</a>), followed shortly thereafter by the growth of pubic hair (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79782\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79782 \">picture 6B</a>). The definitions of and evaluation for precocious puberty and delayed puberty are discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-delayed-puberty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of delayed puberty&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Rapid growth in girls begins during Tanner stage 2 and slows considerably after the onset of menses (usually in Tanner stage 4). Females usually grow only 1 to 2 inches thereafter. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-puberty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal puberty&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An adolescent female should be examined in the same position as described for the preadolescent. Tanner staging should be assessed and attention given to looking for abnormal vaginal discharge and vaginal or vulvar lesions. Estrogen stimulation of the vaginal mucosa produces a thickened, dull-pink mucoid surface. A thin, white, nonfoul-smelling liquid discharge (leukorrhea) normally is present in the otherwise asymptomatic patient.</p><p>Indications for pelvic (speculum and bimanual) examination include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-the-perineum/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent vaginal discharge</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dysuria or urinary tract symptoms in girls who are sexually active</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dysmenorrhea that is unresponsive to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amenorrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal vaginal bleeding</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower abdominal pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contraceptive counseling for an intrauterine device or diaphragm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Performance of Pap smear</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suspected or reported rape or sexual abuse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy</p><p/><p>Bimanual examination of the uterus in a supine preadolescent or adolescent female can be accomplished by palpating the anterior rectal wall with the gloved index finger of one hand while palpating and applying pressure to the lower midline abdominal area with the other hand.

Inspection of the perianal area under normal circumstances should reveal an intact, symmetrically wrinkled area of pigmented skin. Aside from the rare finding of an imperforate anus or an anteriorly placed anus, anatomic abnormalities in the pediatric age group are unusual.</p><p>Infantile perianal pyramidal protrusion (IPPP) is a perianal lesion, previously described as a skin tag or skin fold, reported almost exclusively in girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-the-perineum/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Some authors propose that the lesion be called &quot;infantile protrusion&quot; since it is not always pyramidal and may be perineal rather than perianal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-the-perineum/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The lesion is typically located in the midline, just anterior to the anus, although posterior lesions have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-the-perineum/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. It is described as a pedunculated pyramidal protrusion with a tongue-like lip that is covered with smooth red or rose-colored skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62735\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62735 \">picture 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-the-perineum/abstract/13,14,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14,17</a>]. Tenderness is not reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-the-perineum/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Treatment generally is not necessary. The clinical course is one of recurrent swelling and eventual resolution. Constipation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lichen sclerosis may be associated findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-the-perineum/abstract/15,16,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16,18</a>].

The history of swelling and resolution and characteristic appearance distinguish this lesion from condyloma acuminata (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F83496\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83496 \">picture 8</a>), trauma, skin tags, rectal prolapse, and granulomatous lesions of inflammatory bowel disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-pediatric-physical-examination-the-perineum/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>External hemorrhoids and prolapsed internal hemorrhoids are found primarily in older patients. Perianal fissures caused by straining during defecation and passage of hard stools or by dry irritated skin are seen in all age groups, particularly infants. Careful attention to bruises and lacerations in patients suspected of having been sexually abused should be noted.

In older boys, it is important to assess the position of the testicles, penile length (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77025\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77025 \">figure 2</a>), and retractibility of the foreskin (if the boy is uncircumcised). The evaluation of preadolescent and pubertal males focuses on staging pubertal development (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80005\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80005 \">picture 4</a>), urethral discharge, and scrotal palpation (for testicular position, hernias, and abnormal masses).
