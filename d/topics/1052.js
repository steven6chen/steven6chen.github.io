Therefore, antimicrobial therapy should be dosed to optimize sustained bactericidal serum concentrations throughout as much of the dosing interval as possible. In vitro determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration should be performed routinely.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Empiric therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, therapy for infective endocarditis (IE) should be targeted to the organism isolated from blood cultures; cultures are positive in over 90 percent of patients with IE. For patients with suspected IE who present without acute symptoms, empiric therapy is not always necessary, and therapy can await blood culture results. Results of blood cultures are usually available within one to three days, and an accurate diagnosis is a critical first step in designing a management strategy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-adults-with-suspected-native-valve-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and evaluation of adults with suspected native valve endocarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For acutely ill patients with signs and symptoms strongly suggestive of IE, empiric therapy may be necessary. Such empiric therapy should be administered ONLY after at least two (preferably three) sets of blood cultures have been obtained from separate venipunctures and ideally spaced over 30 to 60 minutes.</p><p>The choice of empiric therapy should take into consideration the most likely pathogens. In general, empiric therapy should cover staphylococci (methicillin susceptible and resistant), streptococci, and enterococci. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Vancomycin</a> (15 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/dose</span> every 8 to 12 hours, not to exceed 2 g per dose) is an appropriate choice for initial therapy in most patients. Additional issues related to the approach to empiric treatment of <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> bacteremia are discussed further separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-approach-to-staphylococcus-aureus-bacteremia-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical approach to Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia in adults&quot;, section on 'Empiric treatment'</a>.)</p><p>Early consultation with a cardiac surgeon should be obtained for all cases in which complications are observed or expected (such as in infections involving prosthetic valves or complicated by moderate to severe heart failure). In addition, consultation by specialists in infectious diseases or cardiology may be useful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical response to initial therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with IE become afebrile three to five days after treatment is begun with an appropriate antibiotic. Patients with <em>S. aureus</em> endocarditis may respond somewhat more slowly, remaining febrile for five to seven days after initiation of therapy. Patients with right-sided endocarditis and septic pulmonary emboli may remain febrile for an even longer duration of time.</p><p>The initial microbiologic response to therapy should be assessed by obtaining repeat blood cultures 48 hours after antibiotics are begun; it is reasonable to obtain at least two sets of blood cultures every 24 to 48 hours until bloodstream infection has cleared [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-native-valve-endocarditis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Thereafter, careful serial physical examinations should be performed to evaluate for signs of heart failure, emboli, or other complications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H100587039\"><span class=\"h2\">Duration of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The duration of therapy depends on the pathogen and site of valvular infection; it must be sufficient to eradicate microorganisms growing within the valvular vegetations. The duration of therapy should be counted from the first day of negative blood cultures (for cases in which blood cultures were initially positive) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-native-valve-endocarditis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Most patients are treated parenterally with regimens given for up to six weeks. In general, six weeks of treatment is appropriate for patients with virulent or relatively resistant pathogens, secondary cardiac or extracardiac complications, and in the setting of prolonged infection prior to diagnosis. Shorter therapeutic regimens may be effective in selected patients with right-sided endocarditis and with endocarditis due to highly susceptible viridans streptococci treated with synergistic antimicrobials.</p><p>In one study including 74 patients with viridans streptococcal endocarditis, none of 66 patients who survived a four-week course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-g-intravenous-and-short-acting-intramuscular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillin G</a> relapsed, and no patient treated with this regimen died of active infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-native-valve-endocarditis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Similarly, four to six weeks of bactericidal therapy with a single drug was shown to be highly effective as treatment for endocarditis due to other streptococcal species and for staphylococci. Prolonged therapy was presumed to be necessary because bacterial concentrations within vegetations are as high as 10<sup>9</sup> to 10<sup>11</sup> colony-forming <span class=\"nowrap\">units/gram</span> of tissue and because organisms deep within vegetations are not accessible to phagocytic cells and often are in a state of reduced metabolic activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-native-valve-endocarditis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-vegetation-formation-in-infective-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of vegetation formation in infective endocarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Completing therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients may complete intravenous therapy as outpatients once hemodynamically stable. They must be compliant and capable of managing the technical aspects of intravenous therapy. Such patients require careful and regular monitoring and must have ready access to full medical care should complications occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-native-valve-endocarditis/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>].</p><p>While on antimicrobial therapy, patients should be monitored for development of complications related to IE, including heart failure. New or worsening heart failure should prompt evaluation for cardiac surgery. Patients should be counseled regarding the need for immediate evaluation in the setting of new fever, chills, or other signs of systemic toxicity, including a thorough clinical evaluation and repeat blood cultures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-native-valve-endocarditis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Weekly laboratory monitoring (complete blood count, liver function tests, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein) should be performed. Serial audiograms may be appropriate for patients receiving long-term aminoglycosides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-native-valve-endocarditis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18272320\"><span class=\"h2\">Follow up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following completion of antimicrobial therapy, indwelling catheters used for infusion of antimicrobial therapy should be removed promptly. A baseline clinical evaluation including transthoracic echocardiogram and laboratory tests (white cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein) should be performed to serve as a reference for serial monitoring of clinical status, including valve anatomy and function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-native-valve-endocarditis/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>].</p><p>Patients should undergo a thorough dental evaluation; the examination should focus on periodontal inflammation, pocketing around teeth, and caries that may result in pulpal infection and subsequent abscess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-native-valve-endocarditis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A full series of intraoral radiographs will allow identification of caries, periodontal disease, and other disease (ie, tooth fracture) not evident from clinical examination. All active sources of oral infection should be eradicated, and patients should be counseled regarding the importance of daily dental hygiene with serial dental evaluation.</p><p>Patients with history of intravenous drug use should be referred to a program to assist with cessation of intravenous drug use.</p><p>The frequency of subsequent monitoring depends upon the baseline evaluation, including the <span class=\"nowrap\">presence/severity</span> of valvular regurgitation. At a minimum, patients should receive follow-up monitoring according to standard recommendations for chronic valve regurgitation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prognosis-of-chronic-secondary-mitral-regurgitation#H17822868\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prognosis of chronic secondary mitral regurgitation&quot;, section on 'Monitoring and evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natural-history-and-management-of-chronic-aortic-regurgitation-in-adults#H9579276\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Natural history and management of chronic aortic regurgitation in adults&quot;, section on 'Echocardiography'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, patients should be counseled regarding the need for immediate evaluation if signs and symptoms of IE recur, including the importance of obtaining blood cultures prior to administration of antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-native-valve-endocarditis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Clinical evaluation including echocardiography should be performed if signs or symptoms of IE recur or if signs or symptoms of worsening valve disease develop.</p><p>In the absence of clinical symptoms of infection, there is no role for routine surveillance blood cultures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3116614268\"><span class=\"h2\">Relapse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with relapse of native valve endocarditis following completion of appropriate antimicrobial therapy should receive a repeat course of antibiotics as described in the following sections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1412510770\"><span class=\"h1\">STAPHYLOCOCCI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The success of therapy for staphylococcal endocarditis is dependent upon numerous factors, including involvement of right- versus left-sided valvular structures, whether the <em>Staphylococcus </em>is coagulase negative or positive, the susceptibility of the staphylococcal isolate, and whether the infection occurs on a native or a prosthetic valve.</p><p>Rare, occasional strains of <em>S. aureus</em> are penicillin susceptible; however, laboratory screening procedures for detecting penicillin susceptibility may not be reliable. Therefore, infective endocarditis (IE) caused by these organisms should be treated with regimens outlined for methicillin-susceptible <em>S. aureus </em>(MSSA) unless penicillin susceptibility can be confirmed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F81429\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81429 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-native-valve-endocarditis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3864077705\"><span class=\"h2\">Methicillin susceptible</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment for native valve endocarditis due to methicillin-susceptible <em>S. aureus</em> consists of a semisynthetic penicillin, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nafcillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nafcillin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxacillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxacillin</a> (12 g per day intravenously [IV] in four to six equally divided doses) or flucloxacillin (2 g every four to six hours) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F81429\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81429 \">table 1</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefazolin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cefazolin</a> is an acceptable alternative for patients with nonsevere penicillin allergy.</p><p>Low-dose aminoglycosides should NOT be combined routinely with antistaphylococcal penicillins or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> for treatment of native valve <em>S. aureus</em> endocarditis. The limited benefit must be weighed against evidence for potential harm, particularly in older adults and in those with diabetes and mild baseline renal dysfunction.

A randomized trial including 236 patients with <em>S. aureus</em> bacteremia and endocarditis demonstrated that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=daptomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">daptomycin</a> monotherapy is not inferior to low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> plus an antistaphylococcal penicillin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a>, although those in the standard therapy arm experienced significantly more renal impairment than those in the daptomycin arm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-native-valve-endocarditis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. An investigation of the safety data from the trial noted significantly greater reduction in creatinine clearance among those who received initial low-dose gentamicin than those who did not (22 versus 8 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-native-valve-endocarditis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Combination short-course (two weeks) beta-lactam plus aminoglycoside therapy has traditionally been a standard approach for treatment of right-sided staphylococcal IE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-native-valve-endocarditis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]; however, a growing body of evidence suggests that the addition of adjunctive aminoglycoside therapy is not necessary and may cause harm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-native-valve-endocarditis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], and the American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines discourage use of adjunctive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> for this indication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-native-valve-endocarditis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The duration of therapy for uncomplicated left-sided staphylococcal IE is six weeks; longer duration of therapy may be warranted in complicated IE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-native-valve-endocarditis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3737653445\"><span class=\"h3\">Penicillin allergy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with native valve endocarditis due to <em>S. aureus</em> who have a history of penicillin allergy can be treated with a first-generation cephalosporin, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefazolin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefazolin</a> (2 g IV every eight hours), if there is no prior history of penicillin reaction that is typical of an immediate-type allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-native-valve-endocarditis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'General considerations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Therapy for infective endocarditis (IE) should be targeted to the organism isolated from blood cultures; cultures are positive in over 90 percent of patients with IE. For patients with suspected IE who present without acute symptoms, empiric therapy is not always necessary, and therapy can await blood culture results. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Empiric therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For acutely ill patients with signs and symptoms strongly suggestive of IE, empiric therapy may be necessary. Such empiric therapy should be administered ONLY after at least two (preferably three) sets of blood cultures have been obtained from separate venipunctures. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Empiric therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, empiric therapy should cover staphylococci (methicillin susceptible and resistant), streptococci, and enterococci. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Vancomycin</a> is an appropriate choice for initial therapy in most patients. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Empiric therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The optimal antibiotic regimen depends upon the causative organism and in vitro susceptibility results. The treatment of native valve endocarditis caused by viridans streptococci, other streptococci, enterococci, staphylococci, HACEK organisms, other gram-negative organisms, and culture-negative endocarditis is discussed in the sections above devoted to these organisms. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Viridans streptococci and Streptococcus bovis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Other streptococcal species'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Enterococci'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1412510770\" class=\"local\">'Staphylococci'</a> above and <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'HACEK organisms'</a> above and <a href=\"#H933452042\" class=\"local\">'Other gram-negative organisms'</a> above and <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Culture-negative endocarditis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The duration of therapy in patients with native valve endocarditis ranges up to six weeks and depends on the pathogen and site of valvular infection. Most patients are treated parenterally with regimens given for either four or six weeks. In general, longer (six-week) treatment regimens are used in patients with highly virulent or more resistant pathogens, those with secondary cardiac or extracardiac complications, and in patients with infections of long duration prior to diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical response to initial therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early consultation with a cardiac surgeon should be obtained for all cases in which complications are observed or expected (such as in the presence of moderate to severe heart failure or heart block or systemic emboli). In addition, consultation with specialists in infectious diseases <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cardiology may be important. Patients with endocarditis require careful regular clinical follow-up that includes serial physical examinations and obtaining follow-up blood cultures to document clearance of bacteremia.
