The general approach to blunt abdominal trauma in children and the diagnosis and management of hollow viscus injury following pediatric blunt abdominal trauma is discussed separately.

Solid organ injuries are common in children who sustain major trauma, with isolated injury to the spleen occurring most frequently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-spleen-and-pancreas-injury-in-children-with-blunt-abdominal-trauma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Injuries to the liver, spleen, and pancreas occur in two typical scenarios: isolated injury caused by a direct blow to the upper abdomen, or multi-system trauma caused by high-energy mechanisms (eg, motor vehicle or all-terrain vehicle crash, fall from a great height) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-spleen-and-pancreas-injury-in-children-with-blunt-abdominal-trauma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Isolated injuries to these organs are more common, but those associated with multi-system injury are more life-threatening with reported mortality as high as 12 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-spleen-and-pancreas-injury-in-children-with-blunt-abdominal-trauma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14482539\"><span class=\"h1\">PERTINENT ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The liver, spleen, and pancreas lie in the upper abdomen. They are partly protected by the ribs. This protection is less effective in children than in adults because the ribs are very pliable and because the liver and spleen may extend caudally beyond the ribs, especially in infants and toddlers. In addition, children have relatively larger viscera, less overlying fat, and weaker abdominal musculature. In children, almost all injuries to the liver, spleen, and pancreas are caused by blunt force. The mechanism can be a direct blow to the epigastrium with deformation of the abdominal wall, avulsion of the blood supply by rapid deceleration, puncture by a fractured rib, or crushing against the vertebral column.</p><p>Because the liver and spleen are highly vascular, injuries to these organs can cause fatal blood loss either from the parenchyma or the arteries and veins that supply them. Both perform essential physiologic functions, but the spleen can be removed completely to stop bleeding when all other approaches fail.</p><p>The liver has a dual blood supply via the hepatic arteries and the portal vein. Like the spleen, the liver parenchyma has a rich blood supply so that parenchymal injuries can lead to life-threatening blood loss. Blood flows from the posterior-superior surface of the liver into the IVC via the hepatic veins. Injuries to these vessels may lead to rapid exsanguination. The liver in children is relatively large and has less fibrous stroma than in adults. These differences make the child's liver more susceptible to laceration and bleeding after blunt abdominal trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-spleen-and-pancreas-injury-in-children-with-blunt-abdominal-trauma/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>By contrast, the parenchyma of the pancreas is not as vascular as the liver and spleen, so pancreatic trauma rarely causes major blood loss. Pancreatic trauma may cause the release of pancreatic juice, which is rich in digestive enzymes, causing local peritoneal and retroperitoneal inflammation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14482553\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial evaluation of pediatric trauma patients should follow the standard Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) protocol, with life-threatening injuries that compromise airway, breathing, and circulation addressed first (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64241\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64241 \">figure 1</a>). Assessment for abdominal injury should take place as part of the secondary survey. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child#H33\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;, section on 'Abdomen'</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of injuries to the liver, spleen, and pancreas should be made on the basis of clinical assessment by history and physical examination and confirmed by diagnostic imaging. These injuries cause harm through two basic mechanisms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding from the parenchyma of the spleen and liver or the major blood vessels that supply these organs</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peritonitis from the release of pancreatic juice</p><p/><p>The clinical assessment of children with blunt abdominal trauma is primarily the search for evidence of bleeding or peritonitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9282651\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is usually a history of a direct blow to the trunk over the upper abdomen (bicycle handlebar, hockey stick jammed between the boards and abdomen, helmet &quot;spearing&quot; in football) or a high-energy mechanism, such as a high-speed motor vehicle crash or a fall from a great height. Children with solid organ injuries often, but not always, complain of pain that may be localized to the area over the injured organ or may be more generalized. With pancreatic trauma, the pain may radiate to the back and with splenic involvement, to the left shoulder (Kehr sign). In patients with multi-system trauma, a decreased level of consciousness or injuries to other parts of the body may mask abdominal involvement. A seemingly minimal force may injure children with preexisting hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. Child abuse should also be suspected in children in whom the history is absent or inadequate to explain the degree of injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-child-abuse-recognition#H2568451820\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical child abuse: Recognition&quot;, section on 'Unexplained major trauma'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9282670\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features of solid organ injury may include findings of hypovolemic shock (eg, tachycardia, prolonged capillary refill time, pallor, altered mental status, decreased urine output, hypotension), abdominal contusions, or tenderness over the upper abdomen. The following findings should be noted on abdominal examination:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal tenderness, specific patterns may be associated with the injured organ:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Right upper quadrant tenderness or superior midline abdominal tenderness &ndash; Liver or pancreas injury</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Left upper quadrant tenderness &ndash; Splenic injury</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Epigastric tenderness &ndash; Pancreas injury</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal wall ecchymosis or abrasions (&quot;seat belt sign&quot; or midline abdominal bruise from a bicycle handlebar)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal distension</p><p/><p>Gastric decompression with a nasogastric or orogastric tube facilitates abdominal examination in the multiple trauma patient and reduces the risk of aspiration of gastric contents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-spleen-and-pancreas-injury-in-children-with-blunt-abdominal-trauma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The abdominal examination is difficult to interpret in patients with impaired neurologic status from head or spinal cord injury or substance abuse and is unreliable in determining the need for further evaluation and intervention in a significant proportion of these patients. For example, a case series of 71 children with head injury and intraabdominal injury discovered on computed tomography (CT) or at laparotomy reported a negative physical examination in 30 patients (42 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-spleen-and-pancreas-injury-in-children-with-blunt-abdominal-trauma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>If present, blood loss great enough to cause shock will usually occur within 24 hours. For example, an observational study of 1813 children with solid organ injuries found that median time to operation was 2.4 hours with 90 percent of the 120 children undergoing surgical intervention within 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-spleen-and-pancreas-injury-in-children-with-blunt-abdominal-trauma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. After 24 hours, the risk of massive bleeding decreases.</p><p>In addition to solid organ injuries, a linear bruise across the abdomen from a seat belt is associated with injuries to the bowel, retroperitoneal vessels, spine, and spinal cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-spleen-and-pancreas-injury-in-children-with-blunt-abdominal-trauma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Patients with delayed presentation of splenic injury (hemorrhage from the ruptured spleen more than 48 hours after trauma) can present with left subcostal pain; left shoulder pain; abdominal distension, rigidity, or rebound tenderness; fullness in the left upper quadrant; or anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-spleen-and-pancreas-injury-in-children-with-blunt-abdominal-trauma/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. Patients with delayed presentation of pancreatic trauma may have findings suggestive of pancreatic pseudocyst, including epigastric pain, palpable abdominal mass, peritoneal findings, and elevated lipase or amylase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-spleen-and-pancreas-injury-in-children-with-blunt-abdominal-trauma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14482567\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The indications for performing specific laboratory studies in children with blunt abdominal trauma are discussed in detail separately.

Of the studies often obtained in these children, the following are most likely to assist with acute patient management:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hematocrit</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type and cross for packed red blood cells</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapid blood glucose</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase [AST] and alanine aminotransferase [ALT])</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum amylase and lipase</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood lactate </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinalysis</p><p/><p>Of these, an initial hematocrit and blood for type and cross are most essential, especially in children with signs of hypovolemic shock.</p><p>Other studies commonly obtained in unstable pediatric blunt trauma victims include (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;, section on 'Laboratory studies'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete blood count with differential</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international normalized ratio (INR) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum electrolytes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arterial or venous blood gas</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood ethanol level and urine screen for drugs of abuse (adolescents)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine pregnancy test (postmenarchal females)</p><p/><p>Laboratory studies have limited sensitivity and negative predictive value for blunt abdominal trauma, including liver, spleen, or pancreas injury. An observational study evaluated the test characteristics of the &quot;routine trauma panel&quot;, including complete blood count, serum electrolytes, glucose, liver enzymes, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and urinalysis in 83 of 241 children with blunt abdominal trauma and evidence of intraabdominal injury on computed tomography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-spleen-and-pancreas-injury-in-children-with-blunt-abdominal-trauma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. No single test had acceptable sensitivity or negative predictive value to be helpful in screening such patients. In this study, glucose and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) had the highest sensitivity (75 and 63 percent, respectively), and lipase had the highest positive predictive value (75 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14482574\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abdominal CT with intravenous contrast is the preferred diagnostic imaging modality to detect intraabdominal injury in hemodynamically stable children who have sustained blunt abdominal trauma. CT is sensitive and specific in diagnosing liver, and spleen injuries, which may be managed nonoperatively. CT with IV contrast alone is less sensitive for detecting pancreas injuries. (See <a href=\"#H14482588\" class=\"local\">'Liver'</a> below and <a href=\"#H14482602\" class=\"local\">'Spleen'</a> below and <a href=\"#H14482609\" class=\"local\">'Pancreas'</a> below.)</p><p>Indications for abdominal CT scan (only for use in the hemodynamically stable patient) include the following (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of blunt abdominal trauma in children&quot;, section on 'Abdominal and pelvic CT'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical examination suggestive of injury (eg, abdominal tenderness, concern for child abuse)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seat belt sign (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hollow-viscus-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children#H7836200\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hollow viscus blunt abdominal trauma in children&quot;, section on 'Seat belt syndrome'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History or mechanism of injury suggestive of intraabdominal injury in a patient with distracting injuries</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/L</span> or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt;125 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/L</span></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gross or microscopic hematuria (&ge;50 red blood cells per high powered field) in otherwise asymptomatic patients</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Declining hematocrit or hematocrit &lt;30 percent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unaccountable fluid or blood requirements</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inability to perform adequate abdominal examination or serial abdominal examinations (eg, children younger than two to three years or those with substance use, head injury, altered sensorium, or planned general anesthesia) in a patient with history or mechanism suggestive of intraabdominal injury</p><p/><p>Focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) is a rapid ultrasound examination of four abdominal locations: right upper quadrant, left upper quadrant, subxiphoid region, and pelvis. The primary utility of this examination for the unstable trauma patient is the detection of hemopericardium <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intraperitoneal fluid secondary to intraabdominal injury (IAI). For example, unstable patients with blunt abdominal trauma and intraperitoneal fluid on FAST may warrant operative intervention in lieu of computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen. In the stable patient, the presence of intraperitoneal fluid on FAST indicates the need for abdominal CT. However, a negative FAST does not have adequate sensitivity or negative predictive value to exclude intraabdominal injury, especially solid organ injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;, section on 'FAST (Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma)'</a>.)</p><p>Contrast-enhanced sonography using blood pool agents appears to have higher sensitivity for solid organ injury in children than FAST. For example, a study in 27 children with blunt abdominal trauma who had both contrast-enhanced sonography and computed tomography of the abdomen with intravenous contrast, contrast-enhanced sonography had a sensitivity of 93 percent and a negative predictive value of 94 percent for 14 injuries to the spleen, liver, pancreas, kidney, and adrenal gland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-spleen-and-pancreas-injury-in-children-with-blunt-abdominal-trauma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, this more labor-intensive form of ultrasound imaging is not widely available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9282930\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic peritoneal lavage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) in children has largely been supplanted by focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST), computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis, and laparoscopy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;, section on 'FAST (Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child#H41\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;, section on 'Abdominal CT'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child#H42\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;, section on 'Laparoscopy'</a>.)</p><p>DPL is not performed in hemodynamically stable children with suspected injury to the liver, spleen, or pancreas because most children with solid organ injury are managed nonoperatively, and intraabdominal bleeding may cause a false positive test in a significant number of such patients. Rarely, DPL may be performed to determine the need for laparotomy in a hemodynamically unstable patient with a suspected emergent, operative head injury although laparoscopy is preferred for this indication by many surgeons.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9284271\"><span class=\"h1\">STABILIZATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial management of children with suspected injury to the liver, spleen, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pancreas should adhere to the Advanced Trauma Life Support protocol for diagnosis and treatment of immediately life-threatening injuries and appropriate resuscitation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64241\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64241 \">figure 1</a>). After the patient has been assessed, resuscitated, and stabilized, the patient should receive ongoing care directed by a trauma surgeon with pediatric expertise, when available. Because optimal care and outcomes occur when the critically injured child is initially resuscitated and subsequently managed in a pediatric trauma center (PTC), it is preferable to provide initial care in such facilities from the outset, whenever possible, or to arrange transfer to a PTC for ongoing management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child#H44\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;, section on 'Definitive care'</a>.)</p><p>In most instances, children with liver, spleen, or pancreas injuries are managed nonoperatively.

However, the decision to operate is based upon hemodynamic stability, <strong>not</strong> CT findings. (See <a href=\"#H14482581\" class=\"local\">'Definitive management'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14482581\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIVE MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H641878\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonoperative management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinically stable children with isolated liver and spleen injuries, grades I through IV (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67884\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67884 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53232\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53232 \">table 2</a>), should receive nonoperative management provided by a pediatric surgeon. Children with grade V or higher (liver) injury usually warrant surgical intervention, but there are exceptions based on the clinical course. Those patients with grade V injuries that remain hemodynamically stable and do not require ongoing blood replacement can be safely managed non-operatively. The clinical course is more important than the CT grade in deciding when to operate. Hemodynamically stable patients can be admitted to an acute care ward, but patients who were initially hemodynamically unstable or anemic require intensive care unit (ICU) monitoring. In more than 90 percent of cases, management of patients with liver or splenic injuries requires only admission to the hospital for monitoring of vital signs, hematocrit, and urinary output, combined with temporary rest and restricted activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-spleen-and-pancreas-injury-in-children-with-blunt-abdominal-trauma/abstract/8,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,19,20</a>].

Exsanguinating hemorrhage may occur, so the surgeon and anesthesiologist must be prepared to respond to massive blood loss. Direct control of the bleeding is ideal, but this may not be possible. Massive bleeding may lead to shock, hypothermia, coagulopathy, hypocalcemia, and lactic acidosis. In this situation, damage control with perihepatic packing to tamponade the bleeding, temporary closure of the abdomen, and return to the ICU to restore physiological stability is currently the preferred course of action (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55259\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55259 \">table 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-spleen-and-pancreas-injury-in-children-with-blunt-abdominal-trauma/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Once physiologic stability is achieved, the child undergoes reoperation with packing change, blood clot removal, definitive repair of injuries, and abdominal closure. In one small series of 22 children with refractory hepatic hemorrhage (13 due to blunt trauma), damage control surgery stopped hemorrhage in 21 patients and 18 patients survived [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-spleen-and-pancreas-injury-in-children-with-blunt-abdominal-trauma/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14482602\"><span class=\"h2\">Spleen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the abdomen is the best way to establish the diagnosis of splenic injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74018\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74018 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62296\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62296 \">image 3</a>).

There is no evidence that nonoperative treatment increases the need for blood transfusion, lengthens hospital stay, or results in missed intraabdominal injuries. Less than 5 percent of patients with isolated splenic injuries ever require a blood transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-spleen-and-pancreas-injury-in-children-with-blunt-abdominal-trauma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>There are no generally accepted guidelines defining when operative intervention is indicated.

No other specific indication has been suggested. However, arterial embolization is an alternative to surgery for selected hemodynamically stable patients with ongoing blood transfusion requirements.

In some cases, this can be accomplished by direct repair or partial splenectomy (leaving at least one-third of the spleen with an intact arterial blood supply). However, splenectomy is often the best option, especially when:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are other significant intraabdominal injuries that require repair</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient is hemodynamically unstable</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The spleen is damaged beyond repair</p><p/><p>Splenectomy patients must be informed about the risk of post-splenectomy infection.

The clinical features include a history of a direct blow to the epigastrium with local pain and tenderness. The serum amylase and lipase are usually elevated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-spleen-and-pancreas-injury-in-children-with-blunt-abdominal-trauma/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The most useful test for suspected pancreatic trauma is computed tomography (CT) with fine cuts through the pancreas. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) does have a role when a major duct disruption is suspected based upon clinical findings and imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-spleen-and-pancreas-injury-in-children-with-blunt-abdominal-trauma/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>]. Pancreatic injuries fall into three main groups:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Injury without major ductal disruption</strong> &ndash; This injury type comprises the largest group of patients with pancreatic trauma. Most cases have simple contusions or hematomas, although some probably have parenchymal disruption. The diagnosis is usually suspected on the basis of elevated serum amylase and lipase levels and is confirmed by CT, which shows swelling and hemorrhage in and around the pancreas, but no evidence of transection or other major parenchymal or ductal disruption. The treatment is nonoperative, including restriction of oral intake initially, intravenous hydration, and parenteral nutrition. For example, in a case series of 43 children with pancreatic injury after blunt trauma, the 18 children with grade I injuries were all managed nonoperatively without complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-spleen-and-pancreas-injury-in-children-with-blunt-abdominal-trauma/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Injury with major ductal disruption</strong> &ndash; Pancreatic trauma with ductal disruption is difficult to recognize, although it is often suggested by CT. Reports have supported the use of ERCP or MRCP to confirm the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-spleen-and-pancreas-injury-in-children-with-blunt-abdominal-trauma/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>]. If recognized early, distal duct disruption can be treated by distal pancreatectomy; proximal injuries can usually be managed with gut rest and observation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-spleen-and-pancreas-injury-in-children-with-blunt-abdominal-trauma/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>], although some experts have recommended proximal ductal stenting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-spleen-and-pancreas-injury-in-children-with-blunt-abdominal-trauma/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Even if missed at an early stage, these injuries almost always resolve with gut rest and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a>, although the course may be prolonged over many weeks. Pseudocysts develop in up to 50 percent of children with ductal disruption who are initially treated nonoperatively and up to 10 percent subsequently require surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-spleen-and-pancreas-injury-in-children-with-blunt-abdominal-trauma/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pseudocyst</strong> &ndash; These patients present with anorexia, vomiting, weight loss, abdominal pain and tenderness, and a palpable upper abdominal mass, days to weeks post-injury. CT or ultrasound can be used to confirm the diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69324\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69324 \">image 5</a>). It is thought that these patients most likely suffered a major duct disruption at the time of the original injury, which had either been unsuspected or missed on the original diagnostic images. The treatment is conservative with gut rest, parenteral nutrition, and observation by serial ultrasound. Some resolve spontaneously, while the rest usually respond to external or internal drainage after a period of four to six weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-spleen-and-pancreas-injury-in-children-with-blunt-abdominal-trauma/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14482637\"><span class=\"h1\">PITFALLS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common error in the management of liver and spleen injuries is failure to recognize life-threatening bleeding at an early stage. The critical period for bleeding is the first 12 hours after injury. Delayed hemorrhage is a rare event.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14482644\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The short and long-term outcome depends mainly on the presence or absence of associated injuries. Early mortality is related to the patient's overall severity of injury and occurs in up to 12 percent of children with blunt abdominal injury and multiple system trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-spleen-and-pancreas-injury-in-children-with-blunt-abdominal-trauma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. If major bleeding does not occur, or if it is treated promptly, a rapid and complete recovery of organ function is the rule. Rare late complications include hematobilia or infected biloma after liver trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-spleen-and-pancreas-injury-in-children-with-blunt-abdominal-trauma/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>] and splenic pseudocyst after splenic trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/liver-spleen-and-pancreas-injury-in-children-with-blunt-abdominal-trauma/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. Late sequelae of pancreatic trauma primarily consist of pseudocysts and are not uncommon. In patients who undergo splenectomy, there is a small but definite risk of post-splenectomy sepsis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-management-of-sepsis-in-the-asplenic-patient#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and management of sepsis in the asplenic patient&quot;, section on 'Incidence'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14482651\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver and spleen injuries are the most common, potentially life-threatening intraabdominal injuries in children who sustain blunt trauma. Pancreatic injury, which is less common, may result in peritonitis or a pseudocyst if a large duct is transected. (See <a href=\"#H14482532\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial evaluation of pediatric trauma patients should follow the standard Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) protocol, with life-threatening injuries that compromise airway, breathing, and circulation addressed first (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64241\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64241 \">figure 1</a>). Assessment for abdominal injury should take place as part of the secondary survey. (See <a href=\"#H14482553\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child#H33\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;, section on 'Abdomen'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with liver, spleen, or pancreas injury usually have a history of a direct blow to the trunk over the upper abdomen (bicycle handlebar, hockey stick jammed between the boards and abdomen, helmet &quot;spearing&quot; in football) or a high-energy mechanism, such as a high-speed motor vehicle crash or a fall from a great height. (See <a href=\"#H9282651\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical findings include local pain and tenderness over the upper abdomen, shoulder pain, or signs of shock from blood loss. Altered mental status or multiple traumatic injuries may mask significant injury to the liver, spleen, or pancreas. An initial hematocrit and blood for type and cross are the most essential laboratory studies, especially in children with signs of hypovolemic shock. (See <a href=\"#H14482553\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After the patient has been assessed, resuscitated, and stabilized the patient should receive ongoing care directed by a trauma surgeon with pediatric expertise. Because optimal care and outcomes occur when the critically injured child is initially resuscitated and subsequently managed in a pediatric trauma center (PTC), it is preferable to provide initial care in such facilities from the outset, whenever possible, or to arrange transfer to a PTC for ongoing management. (See <a href=\"#H9284271\" class=\"local\">'Stabilization'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child#H44\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;, section on 'Definitive care'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal CT with intravenous contrast is the single most useful diagnostic test for liver, spleen, and pancreas injuries in children with findings of serious intraabdominal injury. (See <a href=\"#H14482574\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When a major pancreatic injury is suspected based upon computed tomography findings, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) may be used to determine whether one of the major pancreatic ducts has been disrupted. (See <a href=\"#H14482609\" class=\"local\">'Pancreas'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinically stable children with isolated liver and spleen injuries, grades I through IV (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67884\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67884 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53232\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53232 \">table 2</a>), should receive nonoperative management provided by a pediatric surgeon. Children with grade V or higher (liver) injury usually warrant surgical intervention although children who are clinically stable can be managed non-operatively even with Grade V injuries. (See <a href=\"#H641878\" class=\"local\">'Nonoperative management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In most children with liver and spleen injuries and in the majority of children with pancreas injuries, complete healing will occur without any direct intervention. Thus, definitive management consists of hospital admission with careful and frequent monitoring of vital signs, urine output, and hematocrit. (See <a href=\"#H14482581\" class=\"local\">'Definitive management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main indication for surgery is massive or continuing blood loss in patients with liver or spleen injury that is unresponsive to administration of intravenous fluids and blood, or evidence of major parenchymal or ductal disruption in patients with pancreas injury. Selected patients may be managed with angiography and embolization, especially those who are relatively stable but have ongoing bleeding.
