There are a great many diagnostic entities that may be grouped under this broad heading. It may be that many have unknown effects on immune function. A few disorders where clinically significant immune dysfunction is regularly encountered are presented in this section.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Diabetes mellitus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neutrophil dysfunction underlies much of the predisposition to bacterial and fungal infections found in patients with diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-immunodeficiency-due-to-underlying-disease-states-environmental-exposures-and-miscellaneous-causes/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. In addition, poor peripheral circulation leads to skin ulceration and diminished delivery of neutrophils to sites of microbial entry. Some characteristic infectious complications of diabetes include disseminated candidiasis, rhinopulmonary zygomycosis (mucormycosis), malignant otitis due to <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, and melioidosis (<em>Burkholderia pseudomallei</em>). Bacterial infections of surgical sites are also increased in patients with diabetes, possibly related to the deleterious effect of hyperglycemia on chemotaxis, phagocytosis, and adherence of granulocytes. Issues related to infection in patients with diabetes mellitus are reviewed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=susceptibility-to-infections-in-persons-with-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Susceptibility to infections in persons with diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Dialysis and uremia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients receiving hemodialysis display reduced T cell function in vitro and in vivo (cutaneous anergy), diminished antibody production, and compromised neutrophil and dendritic cell function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-immunodeficiency-due-to-underlying-disease-states-environmental-exposures-and-miscellaneous-causes/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Compromised neutrophil function may be due in part to the use of bioincompatible dialysis membranes, resulting in impaired adherence and attenuated responses to phagocytic stimuli (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-consequences-of-hemodialysis-membrane-biocompatibility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical consequences of hemodialysis membrane biocompatibility&quot;</a>).

However, peritoneal neutrophil function is depressed as a result of the removal of opsonic factors (immunoglobulin and complement) with the dialysate, as well as directly suppressive effects of the dialysate itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-immunodeficiency-due-to-underlying-disease-states-environmental-exposures-and-miscellaneous-causes/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

It is prudent to monitor immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels in any situations where significant loss is ongoing or chronic (more than two to three weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-immunodeficiency-due-to-underlying-disease-states-environmental-exposures-and-miscellaneous-causes/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Hypogammaglobulinemia from protein loss may present as low IgG and immunoglobulin A (IgA), sometimes with near-normal immunoglobulin M (IgM).

More common diseases include celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and intestinal lymphangiectasia. Protein loss should be demonstrable by measurement of the alpha-1 antitrypsin clearance in the stool. Alpha-1 antitrypsin has a moderately higher molecular weight than albumin (50,000), and because it is resistant to proteolysis, it is not degraded in the intestinal lumen. Thus, it passes intact into the stool when there is mucosal inflammation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protein-losing-gastroenteropathy#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Protein-losing gastroenteropathy&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2625885\"><span class=\"h3\">Intestinal lymphangiectasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intestinal lymphangiectasia refers to an abnormal dilatation of intestinal mucosal lymphatic channels, leading to loss of lymph containing immunoglobulins and lymphocytes into the gut. The disorder may be congenital or may arise secondarily to processes that obstruct lymph drainage of the gut or raise central venous pressure. Congenital forms may also be associated with pulmonary chylothorax and lymphedema. It may occur as a result of surgery for congenital heart disease, particularly after the Fontan procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-immunodeficiency-due-to-underlying-disease-states-environmental-exposures-and-miscellaneous-causes/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

The mechanism initiating the cascade of immune effects is thought to be the massive release of inflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1 [IL-1], tumor necrosis factor [TNF]) due to widespread activation of monocytes and macrophages by the products of cellular necrosis. The initial process is often called the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), which then leads to an immunosuppressed state resulting from a compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome (CARS). The spectrum of immune defects associated with trauma is summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F72931\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72931 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Burns</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Burn trauma leads to similar mechanisms of SIRS and CARS. In addition to depression of specific immune activation and effector mechanisms, burns also disrupt a relatively large area of nonspecific defense (the skin). This also greatly increases the risk of infection by providing microbes ready access to the interior of the body. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=burn-wound-infection-and-sepsis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Burn wound infection and sepsis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pseudomonas-aeruginosa-skin-and-soft-tissue-infections#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa skin and soft tissue infections&quot;, section on 'Burn infections'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Environmental exposures that can result in immune dysfunction include ionizing and ultraviolet radiation and toxic chemicals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Ionizing radiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ionizing radiation (radiographs, gamma rays) damages DNA by causing single- and double-stranded breaks, as well as chemical changes in nucleotide base structure. This leads to impaired cell division, as well as to somatic mutations, which may be expressed.</p><p>Impaired cell division is the main mechanism of impairment of immune system function and operates in a manner entirely analogous to what has been described for chemotherapeutic immunosuppressive agents. In addition, radiation may induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) in susceptible lymphocyte populations. Somatic mutations may impair the function of cellular proteins that regulate cell division (eg, the p53 tumor suppressor gene) and lead to malignant cell growth.</p><p>Radiation induces a rapid (hours) dose-dependent decline in peripheral blood lymphocyte counts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-immunodeficiency-due-to-underlying-disease-states-environmental-exposures-and-miscellaneous-causes/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. B cells are more sensitive to radiation than T cells, as reflected in the depletion of germinal centers and other B cell-rich areas of irradiated lymph nodes and spleens. Lymphocyte homing and recirculation are also affected, such that lymphocytes do not properly traffic between different lymphoid organs and regions of the body. In general, B cell numbers recover more slowly following irradiation in comparison with T cell numbers.</p><p>Thymic cortical cells are undergoing rapid cell division and are more radiosensitive than medullary thymocytes. Other thymic cell populations (epithelial cells) are relatively radioresistant. Several decades ago, when an &quot;enlarged&quot; thymus was considered a risk factor for infant mortality, the thymus was irradiated to reduce its size. This frequently resulted in long-lasting depression in blood T cell counts, as well as reduction in the in vitro response to mitogens. In vivo cutaneous delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses were relatively preserved. However, these children showed several delayed effects, including a higher rate of thymoma, as well as allergic and autoimmune diseases, such as asthma, vasculitides, sarcoidosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and thyroiditis. The specific tolerance mechanisms that are affected by radiation leading to autoimmune disease have not been defined.</p><p>Primary antibody responses are most often diminished by whole body irradiation, both due to suppression of proliferation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> induction of apoptosis in B and T cells. As after thymic irradiation, DTH responses and in vitro cellular allocytotoxicity are relatively intact following whole body irradiation. In addition, most functions of mature, long-lived phagocytic cells, such as macrophages, appear to be relatively radiation-resistant.</p><p>Even regional radiation therapy applied for the treatment of malignancy can have systemic immunologic effects. Radiation treatment of lung cancer may lead to diminished T cell numbers and reduced mitogen proliferative response in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-immunodeficiency-due-to-underlying-disease-states-environmental-exposures-and-miscellaneous-causes/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The increased susceptibility to infection that results from high doses of whole body irradiation arises not only from general bone marrow and lymphocyte suppression but also from damage to local defensive barriers. The gastrointestinal tract, and to a slightly lesser extent, the skin, are both organs which always sustain a high rate of cell division to replace cell loss. Irradiation interferes with cell replacement and leads to breakdown of these defensive barriers. Fatal infections may be caused not only by common pathogens but also by normal commensal flora. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-radiation-injury-in-the-adult\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of radiation injury in the adult&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-radiation-exposure-in-children-following-a-nuclear-disaster\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of radiation exposure in children following a nuclear disaster&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Measurable immunologic effects of intense radiation exposure may be long-lived. Japanese studies of survivors of atomic bomb explosions have shown the persistence over 60 years of reduced proportions of helper T cells, diminished in vitro mitogen responses and poor interleukin-2 (IL-2) production, and reduced serum levels of inflammatory cytokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-immunodeficiency-due-to-underlying-disease-states-environmental-exposures-and-miscellaneous-causes/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultraviolet radiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation via sun exposure is the major determinant of risk for skin cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-immunodeficiency-due-to-underlying-disease-states-environmental-exposures-and-miscellaneous-causes/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. This occurs through both direct mutagenesis and disruption of the cell cycle in skin epithelial cells and from suppression of skin immune function. Chronic ultraviolet exposure leads to diminished function of all resident immune cells in the skin, including lymphocytes, mast cells, and mononuclear-derived cells (eg, macrophages and dendritic cells). Immunosuppressive alterations include an increased production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) and an increase in CD25+ regulatory T cells (Treg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-immunodeficiency-due-to-underlying-disease-states-environmental-exposures-and-miscellaneous-causes/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].

The implications for long-term health are unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Toxic chemicals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The discipline of immunotoxicology can be subdivided into two broad areas of study: the unintended adverse immune effects of exposure to natural or man-made chemicals or organisms and toxins and the unexpected (or sometimes expected) adverse immune effects of therapies directed toward suppressing or modulating immune function. Numerous environmental chemicals and particles have been incriminated in causing harm to the immune system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-immunodeficiency-due-to-underlying-disease-states-environmental-exposures-and-miscellaneous-causes/abstract/23-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-27</a>]. Many of these reports are anecdotal, and clinical studies frequently suffer from difficulties in the definition of insults to the immune system, small numbers, inadequacy or lack of appropriate controls, insufficient correlation between clinical problems and laboratory observations, quantitation of exposure to the substance in question, and lack of reproducibility of findings.</p><p>Nevertheless, accumulated experience supports the importance of environmental chemical and noninfectious biologic exposure for immune system dysfunction. The table lists some of the &quot;xenobiotics,&quot; which have been found or suggested to cause immune defects in animals and humans and associated toxicities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F60126\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60126 \">table 3</a>). Specific molecular pathophysiologies have been described in few cases. Many of these compounds are variably bone marrow suppressive and have also been linked to abnormalities of T cell function in vivo (thymic atrophy, circulating lymphocyte subsets, DTH) and in vitro (mitogen, antigen, and mixed lymphocyte responses, cytotoxicity). Some compounds have also been found to cause polyclonal B cell activation and have been associated with autoimmune phenomena. In some cases, exposure has been found to cause an increased incidence of infection, predominantly of the respiratory tract. Several compounds are also implicated in an increased cancer risk, either through direct mutagenic potential, decreased immune tumor surveillance, or both.</p><p>The immune system changes significantly from the newborn period through adulthood, and the immunologic insults (immunosuppression, predisposition to allergy or autoimmunity) resulting from some environmental toxic exposures have different effects depending on age (including gestational age). In general, immunologic (and other) toxic effects are more pronounced in younger developing individuals compared with adults. Research in these areas has led to the emergency of the subdiscipline of developmental immunotoxicology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-immunodeficiency-due-to-underlying-disease-states-environmental-exposures-and-miscellaneous-causes/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">ALLOGENEIC BLOOD TRANSFUSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood transfusion from major histocompatibility-unrelated donors increases the rate of postoperative infection by 30 percent or more [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-immunodeficiency-due-to-underlying-disease-states-environmental-exposures-and-miscellaneous-causes/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

The discipline of psychoneuroimmunology is devoted to the study of these phenomena, although well-defined mechanisms of neural regulation of immunity are yet to be described.

In most cases, these mechanisms selectively affect host response to the invader and are not generally immunosuppressive, with the important exception of the profound immunosuppression resulting from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-natural-history-and-clinical-features-of-hiv-infection-in-adults-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The natural history and clinical features of HIV infection in adults and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Instances in which microbial infection leads to less profound generalized immunosuppression will be discussed here.

Secondary immunosuppression due to measles virus infection is particularly important in the developing world, and malnutrition is an important independent risk factor for severe immune compromise, superinfection, and death from measles infection. The majority of measles mortalities may be attributed to viral, bacterial, or fungal lung super- or co-infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-immunodeficiency-due-to-underlying-disease-states-environmental-exposures-and-miscellaneous-causes/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The most frequent infectious complications of measles are pneumonia, gastroenteritis, otitis media, gingivostomatitis, and laryngotracheobronchitis. Pathogens included common viral agents, such as herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus, parainfluenza, adenovirus, coxsackie, and respiratory syncytial virus. Bacteria included community-acquired organisms, such as <em>Staphylococcus aureus </em>and <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>, as well as nosocomial pathogens, such as <em>Klebsiella</em>, <em>Pseudomonas</em>, and <em>Acinetobacter</em>. <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> and <em>Candida albicans</em> were also found. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measles-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-treatment-and-prevention#H367342723\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measles: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention&quot;, section on 'Secondary infection'</a>.)</p><p>Immune alterations induced by measles include T cell lymphopenia with depletion of T-dependent areas of lymph nodes and spleen, cutaneous anergy, diminished in vitro T cell proliferation with mitogens or alloantigens, and diminished antibody production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-immunodeficiency-due-to-underlying-disease-states-environmental-exposures-and-miscellaneous-causes/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. These effects are caused by direct infection of T cells by measles virus and by infection of dendritic cells, impairing their important <span class=\"nowrap\">antigen-presenting/accessory</span> function in T cell activation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Herpesviruses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Herpesvirus infections can cause transient depression of cell-mediated immunity manifested by decreased in vitro proliferation with mitogens and reduced interferon-gamma production in response to mitogens during the acute phase of the illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-immunodeficiency-due-to-underlying-disease-states-environmental-exposures-and-miscellaneous-causes/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. These phenomena are most profound and long-lived with cytomegalovirus, but secondary superinfection is unusual. Herpesvirus persistence has also been implicated in the mechanisms of immunosenescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-immunodeficiency-due-to-underlying-disease-states-environmental-exposures-and-miscellaneous-causes/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

One exception may be bacteria that produce &quot;superantigen&quot; toxins (eg, staphylococci, streptococci). Superantigens can bind simultaneously to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens and to the nonantigen-binding region of T cell receptor variable regions, thereby stimulating large numbers (up to 20 percent) of T cells. These T cells then produce large amounts of inflammatory cytokines, which lead to a syndrome resembling septic shock with multisystem organ failure (eg, staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome). Following interaction with superantigens, circulating T cells first increase, then decrease. Animal studies have shown that some T cells enter a state of anergy and cannot be further activated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-immunodeficiency-due-to-underlying-disease-states-environmental-exposures-and-miscellaneous-causes/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. These bacteria also produce superantigen-like molecules with distinct biologic activities, including interference with opsonophagocytosis and other neutrophil functions. Although these bacterial products are very important as virulence factors, their role in inducing any secondary immunosuppression is unclear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Mycobacterial infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mycobacteria establish chronic infections and replicate within phagocytic cells (monocytes and macrophages). Several secreted and surface mycobacterial products inhibit the ability of the infected cell to kill the invader and also prevent normal cooperation with other cells in immune responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/secondary-immunodeficiency-due-to-underlying-disease-states-environmental-exposures-and-miscellaneous-causes/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

This leads to diminished vaccine responsiveness, susceptibility to infections by other microbes, delayed graft rejection, and to a higher rate of malignancy. Patients with helminth infections are also less prone to developing allergy or autoimmune disease and have reduced incidence of graft rejection.</p><p>Some of the possible mechanisms underlying the immunosuppression occurring during parasitic infection include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Altered dendritic cell function</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early T helper type 2 (Th2) skewing of immune response</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased interleukin-10 (IL-10) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) production</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The induction of regulatory T (and B) cells and subsequent diminished T cell responsiveness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Altered intestinal microbiome</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Induction of myeloid-derived suppressor cells</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Modulation of gut epithelial cytokine production</p><p/><p>A decreased capacity for antigen presentation and microbicidal activity has been demonstrated in macrophages in malaria, trypanosomiasis, and leishmaniasis.
