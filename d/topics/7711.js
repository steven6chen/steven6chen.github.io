The genetics of HH and our expanding understanding of the function of both the normal and mutant proteins involved in iron metabolism will be reviewed here.</p><p>The clinical manifestations of this disorder (and of other forms of iron overload) are related to iron deposition in tissues, such as the liver, pancreas, and heart. These manifestations, and our approach to the diagnosis of HH in patients with these findings, are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-iron-overload\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with suspected iron overload&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Screening in asymptomatic individuals and management of HH are also presented separately.

Previously, HLA typing had been useful in family studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, with the availability of <em>HFE </em>mutation analysis, such studies are no longer relevant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p>The gene for HH was identified and described in 1996 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Using a positional cloning technique, a novel MHC class 1-type gene, originally called <em>HLA-H</em> and now termed <em>HFE</em> (for <strong>h</strong>ereditary <strong>Fe</strong> [iron]), was found containing two missense mutations. One of these mutations results in a cysteine-to-tyrosine substitution at amino acid 282 (C282Y). Of 178 patients from 32 different medical centers around the United States, the C282Y mutation was found to be homozygous in 83 percent of patients with HH.</p><p>Since this original description, confirmation has come from studies performed in a variety of other countries including France, Australia, Italy, and Germany [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>]. Homozygosity for the C282Y mutation has been found in 69 to 100 percent of individuals with HH (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F56137\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56137 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1634225\"><span class=\"h2\">Homozygosity for the C282Y mutation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) were used to obtain an estimate of the prevalence of the C282Y mutation in the United States population by race, ethnicity, sex, and age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The prevalence of homozygosity for C282Y for US populations was highest in the non-Hispanic white population (0.30 percent) and lowest in the Mexican-American population (0.03 percent).</p><p>In a separate study of 99,711 participants recruited from primary care practices in North America, the following (self-reported) racial prevalences for C282Y homozygosity were found [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>White &ndash; 0.44 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Native American &ndash; 0.11 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hispanic &ndash; 0.027 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Black &ndash; 0.014 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pacific Islander &ndash; 0.012 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asian &ndash; 0.00004 percent</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Defects in HFE other than homozygosity for C282Y</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Defects other than homozygosity for C282Y can be found in patients with phenotypic HH. As an example, in a report of 90 asymptomatic patients with iron overload identified solely on the basis of screening for an elevated transferrin saturation, 57 percent were homozygous for the C282Y mutation, while 37 percent were either homozygous for the H63D mutation, heterozygous for the C282Y or H63D mutation, or compound heterozygotes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 4 to 7 percent of patients with HH are compound heterozygotes, ie, one allele with the C282Y mutation and one allele with an H63D mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/6,7,9,11,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,9,11,15-17</a>]. In at least one pedigree, diagnosed as having both juvenile hemochromatosis as well as adult-onset HH, genetic analysis indicated the presence of compound heterozygosity <span class=\"nowrap\">(C282Y/H63D)</span> along with homozygosity for a mutation in transferrin receptor 2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Transferrin receptor 2 mutation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 1 percent of patients are homozygotes for H63D [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. It is uncertain, however, if the H63D mutation predisposes to iron overload, or is a genetic variant that increases the risk of developing a mild form of hemochromatosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/16,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,19</a>]. A population-based study from Australia suggested that the presence of the H63D mutation was associated with an increase in the serum transferrin saturation but did not result in significant iron overload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 3 to 10 percent of patients are heterozygotes for either C282Y or H63D (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F56137\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56137 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A possible explanation for the HH phenotype in these patients is the presence of additional mutations, either within the <em>HFE</em> gene or elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In one report, for example, iron overload was observed in two siblings who were compound heterozygotes for the C282Y mutation and a novel splice mutation within the <em>HFE</em> gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In a second report, 16 and 7 percent of heterozygotes for the C282Y and H63D mutations, respectively, were carriers of an allele (S65C) leading to a serine-to-cysteine substitution localized to exon 2 in the vicinity of H63D [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Other gene defects leading to iron overload or high ferritin'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In four series, roughly 5 to 7 percent of patients with the HH phenotype appeared to have neither the C282Y mutation nor the H63D mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/6,9,16,17,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9,16,17,23</a>]. A report from Italy, for example, described five unrelated patients with iron overload who were heterozygous for the C282Y mutation but also had novel mutations within the <em>HFE</em> gene (a G-&gt;T transition at codon 168 or a G-&gt;A transition at codon 169) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The clinical significance of these less common <em>HFE</em> mutations is not clear at this time. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Other gene defects leading to iron overload or high ferritin'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">C282Y/H63D compound heterozygotes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In various published series, <span class=\"nowrap\">C282Y/H63D</span> compound heterozygosity has been reported to account for 2 to 5 percent of cases of phenotypic HH, and a penetrance estimated at less than 1.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/9,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,25,26</a>]. Such patients tend to have a lesser degree of iron overload compared with C282Y homozygotes. One study suggested that compound heterozygotes did not develop progressive clinical disease or hepatic fibrosis unless a comorbid feature (eg, excess alcohol consumption, steatosis, diabetes) was also present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Homozygous deletion of HFE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Homozygous deletion of the <em>HFE</em>-containing region of chromosome 6p has been described in a number of cases of phenotypic HH, and is the most common cause of HH in Sardinia, apparently due to a founder effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">HH genotype and clinical disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is controversy concerning the percent of patients homozygous for the C282Y mutation who have, or will develop, clinically apparent disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-34</a>]. While the definitions of &quot;clinically apparent disease&quot; differ among the studies discussed below, C282Y homozygotes appear to have a 72 to 99 percent likelihood of being free of the signs and symptoms of hereditary hemochromatosis at the time of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a population based study of 3011 white adults of northern European ancestry, homozygosity for C282Y was detected in 16 (0.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. All 16 had elevated transferrin saturation and all who underwent liver biopsy had hepatic iron concentrations above the upper limit of normal; however, only eight had clinical features of HH, including four with hepatic fibrosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A larger screening study of over 41,000 adults attending a Kaiser Permanente health appraisal clinic in San Diego identified 152 individuals with the <span class=\"nowrap\">C282Y/C282Y</span> genotype (0.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Only 1 of the 152 homozygotes fit criteria usually applied to the clinical diagnosis of HH, suggesting a penetrance of less than 1 percent.

During 12 years of follow-up, 28 percent of male homozygotes and only 1.2 percent of female homozygotes satisfied criteria for documented iron overload plus evidence of iron-overload-related disease (ie, one or more of the following: cirrhosis, liver fibrosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, elevated aminotransferase levels, physician-diagnosed symptomatic hemochromatosis, arthropathy of the second and third metacarpophalangeal joints). Male C282Y homozygotes with a serum ferritin &ge;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> were more likely to report fatigue, use of arthritis medicine, and a history of liver disease than were men who had the wild-type HFE gene.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Genetic and environmental modifiers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other genetic and environmental factors may be involved in modifying the clinical disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/36-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-39</a>]. Accordingly, it is reasonable to screen patients with HH for coexisting liver disease (eg, hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, fatty liver disease, inherited metabolic liver disease and autoimmune disease). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of hereditary hemochromatosis&quot;, section on 'Liver disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study, the C282Y mutation occurred in 44 percent (versus 11 percent of controls) of 41 British patients with the sporadic form of porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Seven were homozygotes without clinical evidence of HH even though they were at an age (48 to 79) when symptoms should reasonably have occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Thus, for unknown reasons, PCT may be the only manifestation of homozygous HH in selected patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study compared the effect of the presence of beta thalassemia trait on the degree of iron overloading in patients homozygous for the C282Y mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Among male patients with beta thalassemia trait, C282Y homozygotes were younger and had higher serum ferritin levels and hepatic iron indices than those negative for the trait. In addition, they had a higher prevalence of heart failure, clinically manifested pituitary hypogonadism, and hepatic damage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A single nucleotide polymorphism in the CYBRD1 gene appears to account for 11 percent of the variance in serum ferritin levels of C282Y homozygotes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consumption of more than 60 g of alcohol per day (the amount contained in approximately four glasses of wine or beer) was associated with a ninefold increase in the likelihood of developing cirrhosis in a cohort of 224 C282Y homozygous patients with documented iron overload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The risk was increased with alcohol consumption as little as 40 g per day. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-patients-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of patients with hereditary hemochromatosis&quot;, section on 'Avoidance of excessive ethanol'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Potential role of hepcidin or hemojuvelin mutations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overexpression of the iron regulatory protein hepcidin, produced by the HAMP gene, inhibits the iron accumulation normally observed in HFE-deficient mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>], while loss of hepcidin expression is associated with iron overload in both animals and humans. Hemojuvelin, the protein product of the HJV gene that is mutated in patients with juvenile hemochromatosis is thought to be involved in modulating hepcidin expression. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Juvenile hemochromatosis'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=regulation-of-iron-balance#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Regulation of iron balance&quot;, section on 'Hepcidin'</a>.)</p><p>These observations suggest that some of the genetic heterogeneity seen in patients with &quot;classical&quot; iron overload, as well as the low incidence of clinical disease in patients homozygous or heterozygous for the C282Y HFE mutation might be due to the need for a concomitant mutation in a second gene (eg, the HAMP [hepcidin], HJV [hemojuvelin], or transferrin receptor 2 gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]) for full disease expression. Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that creation of a deletional HAMP mutation in mice homozygous for the HFE mutation resulted in a greater iron accumulation than seen in those with only the HFE mutation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>A number of observations suggest that there may be a similar interaction in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 392 patients homozygous for the C282Y HFE mutation and mild to severe iron overload, the five patients with an additional HAMP gene mutation were among those with the highest iron indices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. This study also uncovered subjects heterozygous for both an HFE and a HAMP gene mutation with increased iron indices.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a report of 310 patients homozygous for the C282Y HFE mutation, nine were found with an additional HJV missense mutation in the heterozygous state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Iron indices in eight of the nine patients appeared to be more severe than those in C282Y homozygotes of identical sex and similar age.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">THE HFE PROTEIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The HFE protein is a single polypeptide with three extracellular domains (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F57597\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57597 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. It also contains a membrane spanning region and a short cytoplasmic tail. As discussed in this section, the C282Y mutation appears to inactivate the HFE protein through its inability to bind beta 2-microglobulin, leading to impaired cellular trafficking, reduced incorporation into the cell membrane, and reduced association with transferrin receptor 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>Immunohistochemical studies have shown a unique distribution of the HFE protein in the gastrointestinal tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. In particular, staining in the small intestine was mainly intracellular and perinuclear, limited to cells in deep crypts in proximity to the site of iron absorption. Studies with an HFE-specific monoclonal antibody confirmed its presence in scattered crypt cells in association with the transferrin receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. HFE was also identified in Kupffer cells and sinusoidal lining cells but not hepatic parenchymal cells.</p><p>A role for MHC class I proteins in iron absorption was also suggested by observations in beta-2-microglobulin knockout mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Beta-2-microglobulin is the nonpolymorphic light chain of MHC class I proteins; it is a separate protein and is expected to interact with the HFE protein in a noncovalent manner. Deficiency of beta-2-microglobulin is associated with iron overload and findings similar to those in HH in humans: elevations in the plasma iron concentration and transferrin saturation and an increase in hepatic iron content [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. An unexplained observation in both HH and the knockout mouse is that transferrin saturation initially remains elevated as iron stores are being depleted.</p><p>Direct evidence that mutations in HFE are responsible for HH has come from studies of HFE knockout mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Compared with their normal littermates, these mice develop, after 10 weeks on a standard diet, an elevation in transferrin saturation (96 versus 77 percent) and an eightfold increase in hepatic iron concentration. Iron is preferentially deposited in hepatocytes rather than reticuloendothelial cells, and splenic iron overload does not appear over this time period.</p><p>The cellular interaction between beta-2-microglobulin and wild-type HFE and two mutations has been examined: C282Y, which, as noted above, is responsible for most cases of HH; and H63D, which has an uncertain relationship to iron overload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wild-type HFE and H63D HFE bound beta-2-microglobulin; this interaction was not seen with C282Y HFE.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wild type and H63D HFE were expressed on the cell surface whereas C282Y HFE was localized intracellularly; the C282Y mutant appears to be retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi compartment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p/><p>Another report provides a possible link between HFE, beta-2- microglobulin, and iron metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-of-hereditary-hemochromatosis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. In the human placenta, the HFE protein is expressed at the site at which transferrin-bound iron is transported to the fetus via receptor-mediated endocytosis.
