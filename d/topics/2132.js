The etiology, diagnosis, and treatment of this problem will be reviewed here. Other abdominal disorders in dialysis patients, including abnormalities requiring immediate surgical therapy, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unique-aspects-of-gastrointestinal-disease-in-dialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unique aspects of gastrointestinal disease in dialysis patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of hemoperitoneum varies from 6 percent overall to as high as 57 percent in premenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bloody-peritoneal-dialysate-hemoperitoneum/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Bloody peritoneal dialysate may be related to the peritoneal dialysis catheter, the peritoneal dialysis procedure, the underlying renal disease (such as polycystic renal disease or acquired cystic changes), or may be due to factors unrelated to renal disease. Performance of peritoneal dialysis exchanges allows early detection of intra-abdominal bleeding, including benign cases in patients not on peritoneal dialysis, in whom this finding would be otherwise clinically silent.</p><p>Causes of hemoperitoneum were reviewed in a single-center series of 424 patients; 26 patients (6 percent) developed one or more episodes of hemoperitoneum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bloody-peritoneal-dialysate-hemoperitoneum/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Based upon severity and cause of bleeding, patients could be divided into different groups:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the largest group (n = 21) of cases, bleeding was mild, asymptomatic, and resulted in pinkish or red discoloration of the fluid. These patients were treated conservatively and did not receive extensive evaluation. Menstrual bleeding was believed responsible in seven cases, while a bleeding diathesis (use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> or thrombocytopenia) was responsible in four patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peritoneal bleeding after transplant nephrectomy, increased physical activity, catheter repositioning, and femoral hematoma were responsible for single cases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Minor bleeding with significant pathology was found in single patients with pancreatitis, sclerosing peritonitis, and post-colonoscopy, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe bleeding requiring intervention was observed in six patients, three with likely ovarian cyst rupture, one postsplenectomy, one post-catheter placement, and one with sclerosing peritonitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cause was uncertain in six patients.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Menstrual bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Benign hemoperitoneum occurs in over one-half of menstruating women on peritoneal dialysis; this is likely caused by ovulation, retrograde menstruation, or endometriosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bloody-peritoneal-dialysate-hemoperitoneum/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. In one study of 27 reproductive-age women undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) for more than three months, four of seven who menstruated developed hemoperitoneum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bloody-peritoneal-dialysate-hemoperitoneum/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Of 37 episodes of hemoperitoneum, 22 and 15 occurred at midcycle and with menstruation, respectively.</p><p>Such intra-abdominal bleeding would rarely be observed if peritoneal dialysis was not being performed. It is important to note that a very small amount of blood (&lt;1 mL) is enough to make 2 liters of peritoneal dialysate appear blood tinged.</p><p>When such episodes occur, the woman should be reassured that the hemoperitoneum is benign and that it will likely resolve spontaneously. Rapid flushes and instillation of heparin (typically 500 int. <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span> of instilled volume) in the dialysate to prevent catheter clotting are usually done. Infusing cool dialysate (ie, room temperature) may also be helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bloody-peritoneal-dialysate-hemoperitoneum/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Most commonly, the hemoperitoneum will clear after one to three rapid flushes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Post-catheter insertion or manipulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After insertion of the peritoneal catheter, bleeding into the peritoneal cavity occurs in &lt;5 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bloody-peritoneal-dialysate-hemoperitoneum/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Such bleeding is usually mild and resolves with the performance of several exchanges. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-and-maintenance-of-the-peritoneal-dialysis-catheter\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement and maintenance of the peritoneal dialysis catheter&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Catheter related</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rarely, the peritoneal dialysis catheter may cause enough blunt trauma, resulting in a local laceration. There has been one case report of a peritoneal catheter eroding into a mesenteric artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bloody-peritoneal-dialysate-hemoperitoneum/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. There have also been several reports of splenic lacerations resulting in massive hemoperitoneum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bloody-peritoneal-dialysate-hemoperitoneum/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. This is unusual and likely will be much less common now that &quot;curled tip&quot; rather than &quot;straight tip&quot; peritoneal dialysis catheters are becoming standard. More commonly, but still rarely, the peritoneal dialysis catheter may cause a mild contusion of the surface of the peritoneal cavity, resulting in some bleeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Retroperitoneal pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemoperitoneum may be the result of pathology in the retroperitoneum, often involving the kidney. Cyst rupture in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, acquired cystic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bloody-peritoneal-dialysate-hemoperitoneum/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], and renal tumors are potential causes of bloody dialysate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bloody-peritoneal-dialysate-hemoperitoneum/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. These patients may also have hematuria (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-manifestations-of-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal manifestations of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-cystic-disease-of-the-kidney-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired cystic disease of the kidney in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-evaluation-and-staging-of-renal-cell-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, evaluation, and staging of renal cell carcinoma&quot;</a>). Although very rare and in this case not related to the peritoneal dialysis catheter, hemoperitoneum has also been reported in a peritoneal dialysis patient as a result of a leaking and, subsequently, a ruptured aortic aneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bloody-peritoneal-dialysate-hemoperitoneum/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Additional causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sclerosing peritonitis is an important and ominous cause of bloody dialysate. It should be considered in patients who have been on peritoneal dialysis for a long period of time. Peritoneal calcification has also been associated with bloody peritoneal dialysate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bloody-peritoneal-dialysate-hemoperitoneum/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inadequate-solute-clearance-in-peritoneal-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inadequate solute clearance in peritoneal dialysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Bloody dialysis will occasionally present posttransplant or when peritoneal dialysis is temporarily stopped for other reasons. In such cases, the patient is noted to have blood-tinged fluid when the peritoneal cavity is flushed. This is usually due to peritoneal inflammation and likely an early stage of peritoneal sclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bloody-peritoneal-dialysate-hemoperitoneum/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=encapsulating-peritoneal-sclerosis-in-peritoneal-dialysis-patients#H2041160361\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis in peritoneal dialysis patients&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>Hemoperitoneum may also develop as the result of intra-abdominal pathology, which could occur in nondialysis patients. Potential causes include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Splenic rupture and infarct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bloody-peritoneal-dialysate-hemoperitoneum/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carcinomatosis of the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bloody-peritoneal-dialysate-hemoperitoneum/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver rupture and liver cyst rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bloody-peritoneal-dialysate-hemoperitoneum/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retroperitoneal hematoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bloody-peritoneal-dialysate-hemoperitoneum/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Iliopsoas hematoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bloody-peritoneal-dialysate-hemoperitoneum/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding from the outer uterine wall in a pregnant patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bloody-peritoneal-dialysate-hemoperitoneum/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spontaneous rectal sheath hematoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bloody-peritoneal-dialysate-hemoperitoneum/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Post-cardiac catheterization from a retroperitoneal hematoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bloody-peritoneal-dialysate-hemoperitoneum/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]</p><p/><p>Additional causes include hemorrhagic luteal cyst, ovarian cyst rupture, pregnancy, aneurysm rupture, vascular catastrophe, colonoscopy, and bleeding diathesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bloody-peritoneal-dialysate-hemoperitoneum/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Although anecdotally reported, bloody peritoneal dialysate is not a common presenting sign of peritonitis. In a review of 103 episodes of peritonitis in CAPD patients, for example, bloody peritoneal dialysate was not mentioned as a presenting sign in any case [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bloody-peritoneal-dialysate-hemoperitoneum/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with any clinical problem, a careful history should be obtained. Important considerations include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severity and amount of bleeding</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Features of the bleeding, particularly whether it was self-limited, continuous, or recurrent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Associated symptoms, including those of bleeding disorders (eg, purpura)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reproductive status</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of recent procedures, such as colonoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bloody-peritoneal-dialysate-hemoperitoneum/abstract/16,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,24</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of recent trauma to the patient or dialysis catheter</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, antiplatelet agents, or anticoagulants</p><p/><p>The extent of bleeding and associated symptoms are of primary importance in determining further evaluation. If bleeding is very mild, self-limited, and not associated with other symptoms, the patient may not require further evaluation. This is especially likely if the patient is menstruating.</p><p>For the woman who has bleeding associated with ovulation or menstruation, it is important to note that ovulation frequently stops as the patient begins dialysis; thus, continued menstrual bleeding may be the result of an ovarian cyst or tumor. Imaging of the ovaries and gynecologic consultation are appropriate in this setting.</p><p>If the bleeding is heavy, recurrent, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> associated with pain and fever, urgent evaluation is required to exclude underlying intra-abdominal pathology, such as cyst rupture or a vascular catastrophe. Findings on physical examination such as a rebound or guarding do not occur with benign intraperitoneal bleeding and should be treated as a surgical emergency. In this setting, a peritoneal fluid white blood cell count, differential, culture, and amylase must be obtained, in addition to a complete peripheral blood count and serum coagulation studies. A dialysate spun hematocrit &gt;2 percent suggests significant intraperitoneal pathology. All of the possible disorders in this setting are cause for great concern and merit surgical consultation and consideration of early laparoscopy or laparotomy.</p><p>For the first occurrence of mild, self-limited bleeding, obtaining peritoneal fluid erythrocyte count, white blood cell count, amylase, culture, and peripheral white blood cell count may be indicated. A spun hematocrit may be performed on the peritoneal fluid if there is concern that bleeding is severe. A peritoneal fluid amylase level &gt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span> is suggestive of an intra-abdominal process such as a perforated ulcer or gall bladder. Further evaluation is subsequently performed based upon the results of these studies.</p><p>An abdominal imaging study, such as an abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan, ultrasound, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may also be indicated. Intra-abdominal air is usually present in peritoneal dialysis patients, so an abdominal flat plate is less likely to be helpful. Contrast should be avoided in patients with remaining residual function. Angiography is a last resort that may be required for more definitive diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of the underlying cause is essential, and curative management may require emergent evaluation and care. If the cause of bleeding is idiopathic or benign, the following supportive measures may be indicated:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Instillation of heparin (500 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L)</span> in the dialysate may be useful to prevent clotting in the peritoneal catheter.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frequent exchanges may be useful.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some have recommended the use of room-temperature dialysis exchanges to cause peritoneal vasoconstriction and decrease bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bloody-peritoneal-dialysate-hemoperitoneum/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women who are menstruating, oral contraceptives may prevent ovulation and control bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bloody-peritoneal-dialysate-hemoperitoneum/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stopping <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> or other anticoagulants should be balanced against the therapeutic indications in the individual patient.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24440672\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of bloody peritoneal dialysate (hemoperitoneum) in the peritoneal dialysis patient varies from 6 percent overall to as high as 57 percent in premenopausal women.
