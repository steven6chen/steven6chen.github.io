This topic review will discuss risk factors for gastric cancer. Epidemiologic aspects are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-gastric-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of gastric cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are two main histologic variants of gastric adenocarcinoma. The most frequent is the &quot;intestinal type,&quot; so called because of its morphologic similarity to adenocarcinomas arising in the intestinal tract. The less common diffuse type gastric cancers are characterized by a lack of intercellular adhesions, which leaves them unable to form glandular structures. In patients with inherited form of diffuse type gastric cancer, the absence of intercellular adhesions is caused by a germline mutation in the cell adhesion protein E-cadherin (CDH1). (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PRECURSOR LESIONS FOR INTESTINAL TYPE CANCERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sequence of molecular events that underlies intestinal type gastric cancer is incompletely understood. In comparison, much more is known about the molecular pathogenesis of diffuse type gastric cancers, which display a prominent molecular abnormality in the cell adhesion protein E-cadherin (CDH1). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-genetics-of-colorectal-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular genetics of colorectal cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology and molecular pathogenesis of gastric cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>One model for the &quot;intestinal type&quot; of gastric cancer describes a progression from chronic gastritis to chronic atrophic gastritis, to intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia, and eventually to adenocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Longstanding chronic superficial gastritis caused by chronic Helicobacter pylori infection, pernicious anemia, or possibly a high salt diet leads eventually to chronic atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastric atrophy is accompanied by a loss of parietal cell mass and therefore a reduction in acid production (hypochlorhydria or achlorhydria), a decrease in luminal ascorbic acid (vitamin C) levels, and a compensatory increase in serum gastrin, a potent inducer of gastric epithelial cell proliferation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Similarly, gastric resection results in hypo- or achlorhydria, secondary hypergastrinemia, and bile reflux, especially after a Billroth II anastomosis. The increase in gastric pH would permit colonization of bacteria capable of converting dietary nitrates to potent mutagenic N-nitroso compounds.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic inflammation results in epithelial cell damage with increased free radical generation, a further reduction in luminal ascorbic acid levels, and increased cell turnover.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Atrophic gastritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atrophic gastritis is an autoimmune disorder that is characterized by progressive atrophy of the glandular epithelium with loss of parietal and chief cells. The loss of the normal exocrine glands of the gastric mucosa causes hypochlorhydria (decrease in hydrochloric acid) and a resultant increase in gastric pH. An abnormally high pH in the stomach permits microbial colonization, some of which possess nitrate reductase, allowing nitrosation that is genotoxic. In addition, there is a loss of endocrine cells, which normally secrete epidermal and transforming growth factors, thereby aiding the stomach in regenerating damaged tissue. Populations with a high prevalence of atrophic gastritis also have a high prevalence of gastric cancer, and vice versa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Atrophic gastritis and other conditions that cause gastric atrophy are associated with an increased risk of both cardia and non-cardia gastric adenocarcinomas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F79793\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79793 \">figure 1</a>). The magnitude of the risk is variable in the literature, with estimates ranging from 3 to 18 times greater than an age-matched population. This subject is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Metaplastic (chronic) atrophic gastritis&quot;, section on 'Gastric adenocarcinomas'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Metaplasia is a potentially reversible change from one fully differentiated cell type to another, a process of adaptation to environmental stimuli. The most common form of metaplasia in the stomach is the intestinal type (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F64199\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64199 \">picture 1</a>). It occurs as a result of Helicobacter pylori infection, bile reflux, or can be induced experimentally by irradiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Intestinal metaplasia is more frequent in countries with a higher incidence of gastric carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], and at least in experimental animal models, it precedes the development of gastric carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. An approach to patients with intestinal metaplasia is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metaplastic-chronic-atrophic-gastritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Metaplastic (chronic) atrophic gastritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Data from humans also provide support for the concept of intestinal metaplasia as a precursor lesion for intestinal type gastric cancer. A study from Japan found that the presence of intestinal metaplasia was the only criteria associated with the development of intestinal type gastric cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In China, intestinal metaplasia was found in 33 percent of the population in a high prevalence area of gastric cancer; and dysplasia, common in the lesser curvature of the body and in the incisura, was found in 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Most patients diagnosed with high-grade dysplasia of the gastric mucosa either already have or will soon develop gastric cancer. In gastrectomy specimens for gastric cancer, 20 to 40 percent of patients have associated dysplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Rates of progression from dysplasia to gastric cancer have been estimated at 21, 33, and 57 percent of cases of mild, moderate, and severe dysplasia, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>The absolute magnitude of risk conferred by intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia was addressed in a report from Sweden that included 405,172 patients with gastric biopsy samples taken for a nonmalignant indication between 1979 and 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The risk of gastric cancer was significantly increased in the presence of intestinal metaplasia (hazard ratio [HR] 6.2, 95% CI 4.7-8.2) and dysplasia (HR 10.9, 95% CI 7.7-15.4). It was estimated that approximately 1 in 39 patients with intestinal metaplasia and 1 in 19 with dysplasia would develop gastric cancer within 20 years.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PRECURSOR LESIONS FOR DIFFUSE TYPE CANCERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to intestinal type gastric cancers, diffuse type gastric cancers have no clearly defined precancerous lesion. Diffuse type gastric cancer is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology and molecular pathogenesis of gastric cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">ENVIRONMENTAL RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are geographic and ethnic differences in the incidence of gastric cancer around the world, as well as trends in each population over time. Emigrants from high-incidence to low-incidence countries often experience a decreased risk of developing gastric carcinoma. Such findings strongly suggest that environmental factors have an important role in the etiology of gastric cancer and that exposure to risk factors occurs early in life. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-gastric-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of gastric cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Diet</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H367054345\"><span class=\"h3\">Salt and salt-preserved foods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Substantial evidence from ecological, case-control, and cohort studies strongly suggests that the risk of gastric cancer increases with a high intake of salt and various traditional salt-preserved foods such as salted fish, cured meat, and salted vegetables [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer/abstract/12-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-17</a>]. In 2007, salt and <span class=\"nowrap\">salted/salty</span> foods were classified as probable risk factors for gastric cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>A potential synergistic effect of salt and H. pylori has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], though not in all studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The role of salt and salted foods in the causal link between H. pylori and gastric cancer is discussed in more detail below. (See <a href=\"#H21378716\" class=\"local\">'Helicobacter pylori'</a> below.)</p><p>High salt intake damages stomach mucosa and increases the susceptibility to carcinogenesis in rodents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. The induced proliferative change may act to promote the effect of food-derived carcinogens.</p><p>The declining incidence of gastric cancer worldwide over the last 50 years has been attributed, at least in part, to the spread of refrigeration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], the use of which would inversely correlate with salting and other salt-based methods of preservation such as curing and smoking, and with the overall volume of salt in the diet. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-gastric-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of gastric cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Nitroso compounds</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Humans are exposed to N-nitroso compounds (compounds containing an -NO group) from diet, tobacco smoke, and other environmental sources, as well as from endogenous synthesis, which contributes to 40 to 75 percent of total exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. N-nitroso compounds are generated after consumption of nitrates, which are natural components of foods like vegetables and potatoes and are used as a food additive in some cheeses and cured meats. Dietary nitrates are absorbed in the stomach and secreted in saliva in a concentrated form where they are reduced to nitrites by oral bacteria. Nitrites can also react with nitrosatable compounds like amines, amides, and amino acids to form N-nitroso compounds.</p><p>The evidence linking N-nitroso compounds to gastric cancer is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated levels of gastric nitrite, particularly in a high pH environment, have been linked to advanced precancerous gastric lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of gastric cancer associated with dietary intake of nitrites and nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and endogenous formation of nitroso compounds was investigated in the EPIC (European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition) study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. While there was no association between intake of nitrites and NMDA and gastric cancer risk, endogenous production of N-nitroso compounds was significantly associated with non-cardia cancer risk (hazard ratio [HR] 1.42, 95% CI 1.14-1.78).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diets that are high in fried food, processed meat, and fish and alcohol (and low in vegetables, fruits, milk, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin A</a>) have been associated with an increased risk of gastric carcinoma in several epidemiologic studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer/abstract/15,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,26,27</a>]. A meta-analysis estimated that the relative risk of gastric cancer associated with consumption of 30 g of processed meat per day (approximately one-half an average serving) was 1.15 (95% CI 1.04-1.27) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The risk of noncardia gastric cancer was particularly increased by red and processed meat consumption among H. pylori positive individuals in a large, prospective nutrition survey [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In 2015, the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) reviewed the evidence linking intake of processed meat with a variety of cancer sites and concluded that there was a positive association between consumption of processed meat and stomach cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. A majority of the working group concluded that there was sufficient evidence in human beings for the carcinogenicity of consuming processed meat. Processed meats (eg, sausages, bacon, ham, beef jerky, corned beef, and other smoked, salted, fermented, or cured meats) were classified as group 1 carcinogens, placing these foods in the same risk category for cancer as asbestos, cigarettes, and alcohol (although the amount of increased risk is nowhere near the same).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H367054797\"><span class=\"h3\">Fruits, vegetables, and fiber</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Consumption of fruits and vegetables, particularly fruit, is probably protective against gastric cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Case-control studies from Europe, Asia, and North America have consistently found intake of fruits and vegetables to be protective against gastric cancer, reducing the risk by approximately 40 percent for fruits, and 30 percent for vegetables for the highest versus lowest categories of intake, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer/abstract/30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-33</a>]. Diets low in citrus fruit show the strongest association with gastric carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Cohort studies have been less consistent. A meta-analysis of 17 studies found a weaker overall association in the reduction of gastric cancer risk from high intake of fruits (summary relative risk [SRR] 0.90, 95% CI 0.83-0.98), but there was no discernible protective effect from vegetables (SRR 0.96, 95% CI 0.88-1.06) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>The protection afforded by vegetables and fruits is most likely related to their vitamin C content, which is thought to reduce the formation of carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds inside the stomach. Cooked vegetables do not show the same protective effect as uncooked vegetables [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Dietary fiber may reduce the risk of gastric cancer. In a meta-analysis, the summary odds ratio (OR) for the highest versus lowest intake of dietary fiber was 0.58 (95% CI 0.49-0.67) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The association was similar for different fiber sources and types, and for diffuse-type gastric cancer (OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.42-0.92) and intestinal-type gastric cancer (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.45-0.89). In contrast to these results, the prospective EPIC-EURGAST study found that cereal fiber (but not other types of fiber) had strong protective role for diffuse type of gastric cancer, but not intestinal type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Further study on different food sources of fiber in relation to gastric cancer risk is warranted to confirm these relationships.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Folate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A meta-analysis of epidemiology studies found an inconsistent association between dietary folate and the risk of gastric cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Obesity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excess body weight is associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>]. In a meta-analysis of cohort studies identifying 9492 gastric cancer cases, excess body weight (defined as a body mass index [BMI] &ge;25 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> was associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.06-1.41) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The strength of the association increased with increasing BMI. Whether this risk extends to all stomach sites is not clear. An updated 2016 analysis of observational studies on cancer risk and excess body fatness conducted by a working group of the IARC concluded that the data were sufficient for gastric cardia cancers (relative risk for the highest BMI category evaluated versus a normal BMI 1.8 [95% CI 1.3-2.5]) but not for gastric noncardia cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Smoking</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have examined the relationship between tobacco smoking and gastric cancer. A meta-analysis of 42 studies estimated that the risk was increased by approximately 1.53-fold and was higher in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. A prospective study from Europe (EPIC) found a similar magnitude of risk, which diminished after 10 years of smoking cessation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Approximately 18 percent of gastric cancer cases were attributed to smoking.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1815549012\"><span class=\"h2\">Occupational exposures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is some evidence that occupations in coal and tin mining, metal processing, particularly steel and iron, and rubber manufacturing industries lead to an increased risk of gastric cancer; however, the data are disparate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer/abstract/45-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21378716\"><span class=\"h2\">Helicobacter pylori</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer classified H. pylori as a Group 1 or definite carcinogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. As noted above, intestinal type gastric carcinoma is believed to evolve as a progression from atrophy to metaplasia, dysplasia, and then carcinoma. The most common cause of gastritis is H. pylori (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F51050\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51050 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p>Four sources of evidence support an association between H. pylori infection and gastric cancer: epidemiologic studies comparing prevalence rates of gastric cancer and H. pylori infection, cross-sectional studies evaluating H. pylori infection in patients with gastric cancer, prospective studies associating H. pylori infection with gastric cancer, and clinical trials demonstrating a significantly reduced incidence of gastric cancer after eradication of H. pylori. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=association-between-helicobacter-pylori-infection-and-gastrointestinal-malignancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Association between Helicobacter pylori infection and gastrointestinal malignancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is thought that H. pylori infection triggers inflammation at the corpus mucosa that results in atrophy and intestinal metaplasia. H. pylori infection has been associated with an approximate sixfold increase in the risk with adenocarcinomas distal to the cardia, including both the intestinal and diffuse types.

In addition, a synergistic interaction between H. pylori infection and salted food intake to increase the risk of gastric cancer has also been reported in some [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer/abstract/16,52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,52,53</a>], but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], case-control studies.

A possible explanation is that mucosal damage caused by high salt intake facilitates H. pylori infection. The resultant hypochlorhydria and bacterial overgrowth, with the subsequent conversion of nitrites to the mutagenic N-nitrosamines, may then lead to metaplasia, dysplasia, and cancer.

As a result, vitamin C may have an important role in preventing the damage caused by H. pylori through its antioxidant effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-carotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Beta-carotene</a> and ascorbic acid are believed to interfere with the progression to cancer through their anti-nitrosation and antioxidant effects, and thus act as protective factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A model of gastric carcinogenesis recognizes the interplay between exogenous risk factors (such as H. pylori or nitroso compounds), endogenous protective factors (such as the ability to repair DNA damage), and exogenous protective factors (such as antioxidants). H. pylori infection in early life leads to chronic inflammation. The resulting cellular proliferation increases the likelihood of mitotic error. Dietary mutagens may also increase the risk of mutation while dietary antioxidants act as protective factors. Because some DNA damage can be self-corrected, H pylori-related mutations only rarely lead to malignant transformation. Thus, longer duration of infection, especially infection acquired during childhood and continuing until old age, increases the risk of significant DNA damage with subsequent malignant transformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risk-factors-for-gastric-cancer/abstract/127\" class=\"abstract_t\">127</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>H. pylori genotype and host genetic polymorphisms have a role in determining the clinical consequences of H. pylori infection and hence the risk of developing gastric cancer.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Precursor lesions for intestinal type cancers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastric cancer developing in patients considered to be at average risk involves an interplay of bacterial, host, and environmental facts. Dietary (nitroso compounds, high salt diet with low vegetables) and lifestyle factors (smoking and alcohol consumption) probably account for one-third to one-half of all gastric cancers. H. pylori infection, especially certain genotypes (vacAs1-, vacAm1-, and cagA-positive), remains an important risk factor. The risk is increased further in hosts who possess specific types of cytokine polymorphisms <span class=\"nowrap\">(IL-1B-511*T/*T</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">IL-1B-511*T/*C)</span>. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diet'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although most gastric cancers are sporadic, aggregation within families occurs in approximately 10 percent of cases. Truly hereditary (familial) gastric cancer accounts for 1 to 3 percent of the global burden of gastric cancer and comprises at least three major syndromes: hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC), gastric adenocarcinoma and proximal polyposis of the stomach (GAPPS), and familial intestinal gastric cancer (FIGC). The risk of developing gastric cancer is high in these families, but only HDGC is genetically explained (germline mutations in the <em>CDH1</em> gene encoding e-cadherin in up to 50 percent of HDGC patients). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Gastric cancer has also been described in association with certain other inherited cancer syndromes including Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer), familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Peutz Jeghers syndrome, juvenile polyposis, hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, and possibly phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) hamartoma tumor (Cowden's) syndrome, but these are all fairly rare causes of gastric cancer. Nevertheless, guidelines for management of individuals affected by these syndromes recommend screening for gastric cancer.
