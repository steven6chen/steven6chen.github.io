Patients should be encouraged to participate in clinical trials, when available.</p><p>Our approach, described in the sections below and outlined in the algorithms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F101274\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101274 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F101275\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101275 \">algorithm 2</a>) , is derived from clinical experience, numerous retrospective and prospective case series and single-arm trials, and a very small number of randomized trials.</p><p>General principles that guide therapy in patients with PCNSL include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PCNSL tends to be highly sensitive to both radiation and selected chemotherapeutic agents, which distinguishes it from most other malignant primary brain neoplasms. Surgery has a limited, mainly diagnostic, role, since PCNSL tends to be a diffuse rather than localized disease. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pretreatment evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurologic deficits and decreased functional status related to the tumor tend to improve rapidly with successful therapy (eg, within one to two cycles of chemotherapy or during radiation therapy). The disease can be exquisitely sensitive to glucocorticoids as well, although not durably (see <a href=\"#H173301660\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids'</a> below). For these reasons, patients with a low functional status may nonetheless be candidates for a trial of therapy, particularly if they show an early response to glucocorticoids.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MTX, given at sufficiently high doses to penetrate the central nervous system (CNS), is the most active single agent against PCNSL identified to date. High-dose intravenous MTX should therefore be the backbone of induction therapy in most patients. Standard combination chemotherapy regimens that are useful in the treatment of systemic lymphoma (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> [CHOP]) are either ineffective or toxic in the treatment of PCNSL and should not be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H173295579\" class=\"local\">'Methotrexate-based induction chemotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goal of induction chemotherapy is a complete radiographic response (CR), which can be achieved in over half of patients with MTX-based therapy and is generally associated with superior outcomes compared with partial response or stable disease. (See <a href=\"#H173295619\" class=\"local\">'Endpoint of induction therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients, even those in CR, do not achieve long-term disease control or survival with induction chemotherapy alone. The optimal consolidation therapy has not been established, however, and all strategies have the potential for increased toxicity. The three main consolidation approaches being explored include high-dose chemotherapy with autologous hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) rescue, non-myeloablative chemotherapy, and reduced-dose whole brain radiation (WBRT). Optimal consolidation therapy in older adults has not been established. (See <a href=\"#H173295586\" class=\"local\">'Consolidation therapy'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-dose MTX can generally be given safely to older adults and those with mild to moderate renal insufficiency, provided appropriate dose reductions and precautions are taken. Patients with severe renal insufficiency (ie, creatinine clearance &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute)</span> are not good candidates for MTX, however; alternative induction strategies for such patients include high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etoposide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etoposide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temozolomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">temozolomide</a>, and radiation. WBRT is generally avoided in older patients, except as a palliative option, due to high risk of delayed neurotoxicity. (See <a href=\"#H173295678\" class=\"local\">'Older adults'</a> below and <a href=\"#H173295671\" class=\"local\">'Patients with renal insufficiency'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with ocular and leptomeningeal disease at the time of presentation (either symptomatic or discovered on pretreatment evaluation) are generally treated similarly to those with more limited parenchymal brain disease, but consideration of additional site-specific therapy (eg, ocular radiation or intraocular MTX for ocular disease; intrathecal chemotherapy for leptomeningeal disease) is warranted prior to consolidation. (See <a href=\"#H173295685\" class=\"local\">'Ocular disease'</a> below and <a href=\"#H173295692\" class=\"local\">'Leptomeningeal disease'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H173295579\"><span class=\"h2\">Methotrexate-based induction chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High-dose MTX-based chemotherapy is a standard component of initial therapy for PCNSL. In aggregate, the available data suggest that chemotherapy regimens that include high-dose systemic MTX are more effective against PCNSL than either radiation alone or regimens that do not contain MTX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. The addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> to MTX-based regimens may provide additional benefit and is well tolerated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H173295593\"><span class=\"h3\">Choice of regimen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The activity of MTX as a single agent given systemically, intra-arterially, or in combination with other agents has been demonstrated in numerous retrospective and prospective studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/12-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-19</a>]. Complete responses are seen in 30 to 60 percent of patients treated with high-dose MTX alone or in combination with other agents.</p><p>The optimal high-dose MTX-based regimen for PCNSL is unknown, however, and there is variation in clinical practice. While single-agent MTX has significant activity, the available data reviewed below as well as the experience in other hematologic malignancies suggest that combination therapy may be more effective than single-agent induction therapy. Combination therapy comes at the expense of increased toxicity, however [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p>For most patients with a good performance status (ie, ECOG &le;3), we suggest using MTX-based combination regimen rather than MTX alone.

As described above, a CR is achieved in approximately 30 to 60 percent of patients with high-dose MTX-based induction therapy. Formal response evaluation criteria are reviewed below. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Response evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>Importantly, the median number of doses of MTX required to achieve CR is approximately six to eight in most studies. In some cases, an incomplete response reflects an inadequate number of induction cycles, and a CR can be achieved with several more cycles. In our experience, it is not unusual for patients to require 10 or 12 doses of MTX to achieve a maximal response.</p><p>The optimal approach in patients with a partial response to adequate induction chemotherapy or primary refractory disease is uncertain. Since some patients with a partial response will achieve a complete response with high-dose chemotherapy and autologous HCT, there is rationale for proceeding with consolidation in patients who are otherwise good candidates for high-dose chemotherapy, acknowledging that the risk to benefit ratio of transplant is higher in these patients. WBRT is an alternative option.</p><p>In patients with primary refractory disease who progress during MTX-based induction chemotherapy, we typically try second-line chemotherapy with an agent such as high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cytarabine</a> before proceeding with alternative salvage therapies such as WBRT.

One hypothesis is that late relapse results from residual systemic malignant cells that are below the limits of detection using flow cytometry of peripheral blood and combined <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> imaging. </p><p>Non-myeloablative chemotherapy and high-dose chemotherapy supported by autologous HCT are the two main strategies being investigated in an attempt to eliminate residual disease. We favor this approach for younger patients with a good performance status who have achieved a complete response, ideally within the context of a clinical trial. Representative studies are reviewed below. (See <a href=\"#H173295633\" class=\"local\">'High-dose chemotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p>WBRT remains an alternative consolidation approach in younger patients, particularly those with contraindications to further chemotherapy, which has been shown to improve progression-free survival but not overall survival compared with induction chemotherapy alone.

Our approach is derived from clinical experience, numerous retrospective and prospective case series and single-arm trials, and a very small number of randomized trials (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F101274\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101274 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F101275\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101275 \">algorithm 2</a>).
