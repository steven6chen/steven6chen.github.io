This includes venous thrombi, air, amniotic fluid, fat, injected foreign material, and tumor. The malignant pulmonary embolization syndromes, pulmonary tumor emboli and lymphangitic carcinomatosis, are associated with a poor prognosis. Thus, prompt recognition is critical so that therapy can be initiated in a timely fashion. </p><p>The epidemiology, etiology, and pathogenesis of pulmonary tumor emboli and pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis are reviewed here. The clinical features, diagnostic evaluation, and management of pulmonary tumor emboli and pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis and the embolization of venous thrombi, air, amniotic fluid, fat, or foreign material are discussed separately.

The terminology for both disorders is often used interchangeably and while they are often considered as morphologically distinct from each other, overlap is not infrequent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-tumor-embolism-and-lymphangitic-carcinomatosis-in-adults-epidemiology-etiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Both disorders need to be distinguished from pulmonary metastases, which are identified pathologically as solid isolated lesions that have the classic morphologic features of lung invasion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-risk-factors-pathology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-lung-cancer#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the risk factors, pathology, and clinical manifestations of lung cancer&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.) &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4023872218\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary tumor embolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary tumor embolism refers to the identification of tumor within pulmonary blood vessels on pathologic lung samples. Invasion of the surrounding interstitium is not typically seen, a feature that distinguishes it from pulmonary metastases. However, tumor may sometimes also be concomitantly seen within lymphatic vessels. Due to the prominent involvement of pulmonary vasculature, patients with this syndrome are more likely to present with the signs and symptoms of pulmonary hypertension and acute right heart failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-tumor-embolism-and-lymphangitic-carcinomatosis-in-adults-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary tumor embolism and lymphangitic carcinomatosis in adults: Diagnostic evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2731570494\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lymphangitic carcinomatosis is morphologically defined by the presence of tumor within pulmonary lymphatics. Tumor cells within pulmonary veins are not typically seen; however, tumor cells can invade the interstitium resulting in thickened bronchovascular bundles and interstitial septae. Since pulmonary capillary obstruction is not a feature of this disorder, patients with this syndrome are less likely to present with the signs and symptoms of pulmonary hypertension and acute right heart failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-tumor-embolism-and-lymphangitic-carcinomatosis-in-adults-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary tumor embolism and lymphangitic carcinomatosis in adults: Diagnostic evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4063727266\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The true incidence of pulmonary tumor embolism and lymphangitic carcinomatosis is unknown since the diagnosis is most often post mortem. In our experience, as clinical syndromes they are rare presentations among patients with malignancy and rare causes of hypoxemic respiratory failure. Due to the subtle presentation and diagnostic delay, the incidence is probably higher on autopsy than on biopsy specimens. One autopsy series of 65,181 cancer patients identified tumor embolism in 0.19 percent and tumor invasion into a large vein in 0.11 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-tumor-embolism-and-lymphangitic-carcinomatosis-in-adults-epidemiology-etiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Comparatively, thrombotic pulmonary embolism was identified in 2.3 percent of patients. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3259929671\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common malignancies that are associated with these disorders are similar and are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F67921\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67921 \">table 1</a>). However, any malignant tumor has the potential to result in pulmonary tumor emboli or lymphangitic carcinomatosis with case reports of cases due to cutaneous angiosarcoma and lip cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-tumor-embolism-and-lymphangitic-carcinomatosis-in-adults-epidemiology-etiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/1,3-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3-10</a>].</p><p>The risk of tumor emboli appears to be the greatest with renal cell and hepatocellular carcinoma as well as mucin-secreting adenocarcinomas of the breast, lung, stomach, and colon. Tumor emboli can also complicate prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, and choriocarcinoma, and is a rare presentation of other malignancies including chondrosarcoma and lymphoma. Common malignancies associated with pulmonary lymphangitic carcinomatosis are similar, particularly adenocarcinoma of the stomach, lung, head and neck, and esophagus. Since many of these malignancies involve thoracic lymph nodes, this has led to the theory that tumors such as these cause lymphangitis via retrograde flow to the lungs. (See <a href=\"#H3415337308\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3415337308\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of pulmonary tumor embolism and lymphangitic carcinomatosis is poorly understood. It is not studied and most theories are based upon the histologic appearance of autopsy specimens as well as indirect data derived from studies that investigate the mechanisms of traditional invasive metastatic disease. It is thought that, similar to solid pulmonary metastases, tumor gains access to the lungs to induce local pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-tumor-embolism-and-lymphangitic-carcinomatosis-in-adults-epidemiology-etiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/1,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11,12</a>]. However, the resultant morphologic change that ensues is different for all three entities. While tumor embolism predominantly involves pulmonary vasculature, lymphangitic carcinomatosis primarily involves the lymphatic system, and solid metastases invade all components of pulmonary parenchymal tissue. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3838641937\"><span class=\"h2\">Accessing the lungs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tumor cells likely gain access to the lung via venous and lymphatic circulations or possibly via transdiaphragmatic passage (eg, peritoneal carcinomatosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-tumor-embolism-and-lymphangitic-carcinomatosis-in-adults-epidemiology-etiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/1,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11,12</a>]. </p><p>Access to blood and lymphatic vessels may be due to direct invasion of nearby vessels (eg, pulmonary vein, inferior vena cava, thoracic lymphatics). In one autopsy series of cancer patients, tumor invasion into a large vein was identified in 0.11 percent of autopsies, 13 percent of whom had concomitant tumor emboli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-tumor-embolism-and-lymphangitic-carcinomatosis-in-adults-epidemiology-etiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Alternatively, tumor fragments may be released into the tumor's neovasculature or neolymphatics. </p><p>Most of the circulating tumor cells are destroyed by circulatory mechanical forces, shear forces, or the host's immune system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-tumor-embolism-and-lymphangitic-carcinomatosis-in-adults-epidemiology-etiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. However, some tumor cells, for ill-defined reasons, reach the lungs to induce pathology. </p><p>It is unclear whether diaphragmatic translocation of tumor cells from the peritoneum is a viable mechanism but it has been proposed in older case reports of malignancies involving the peritoneum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-tumor-embolism-and-lymphangitic-carcinomatosis-in-adults-epidemiology-etiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2331859201\"><span class=\"h2\">Inducing lung pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It has been proposed that tumor emboli and lymphangitic carcinomatosis are spectrums of the same disease since components of both disorders can be found pathologically in some cases. However, this is not universal and the two disorders frequently exist as separate entities on pathologic specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-tumor-embolism-and-lymphangitic-carcinomatosis-in-adults-epidemiology-etiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/1,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13</a>]. Thus, the mechanism that underlies the induction of tumor pathology in the lung may be different for each entity. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pulmonary tumor embolism</strong> &ndash; Tumor cells appear to become trapped within the pulmonary circulation and trigger the coagulation cascade to obstruct the pulmonary vessels. Reactive concentric medial hypertrophy and intimal fibrosis of the pulmonary vessels (&quot;obliterative arteritis&quot;) may also contribute to the obliterative pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-tumor-embolism-and-lymphangitic-carcinomatosis-in-adults-epidemiology-etiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. The process can progress to complete and irreversible obstruction of pulmonary vessels; this is in contrast to obstruction by venous thromboemboli, which is generally reversible via the process of recanalization. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When the pulmonary vasculature becomes obstructed, ventilation-perfusion matching becomes impaired and pulmonary vascular resistance increases, which may impair gas exchange and cause pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale, which are prominent clinical features of this condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-tumor-embolism-and-lymphangitic-carcinomatosis-in-adults-epidemiology-etiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Intraluminal tumor emboli do not appear to proliferate intravascularly or invade the vessel wall to spread locally; thus, they should not be considered metastases. Lung metastasis requires malignant cells to adhere to lung-specific adhesion molecules on the endothelium, produce enzymes that degrade the basement membrane and lung extracellular matrix, and grow in association with lung-specific growth factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-tumor-embolism-and-lymphangitic-carcinomatosis-in-adults-epidemiology-etiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/13,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,20</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lymphangitic carcinomatosis</strong> &ndash; It is presumed that tumor cells trapped within lymphatics result in local obstruction and fluid accumulation. Bronchovascular bundle and alveolar septal thickening may be due to local edema, and the presence of nodules in some cases may suggest that tumor cells in lymphangitic carcinomatosis can grow locally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pulmonary-tumor-embolism-and-lymphangitic-carcinomatosis-in-adults-epidemiology-etiology-and-pathogenesis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Invasion of surrounding tissue is not typically observed. Pulmonary vessels tend not to be involved, explaining why pulmonary hypertension is a less common presentation among this population. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1133295451\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary tumor emboli and lymphangitic carcinomatosis are rare, end-stage manifestations of malignancy that have a poor prognosis.
