(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-airway-management-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic airway management in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-endotracheal-intubation-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency endotracheal intubation in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-rsi-outside-the-operating-room-in-children-approach\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) outside the operating room in children: Approach&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18429469\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of airway device for difficult endotracheal intubation in children is dependent upon whether the patient has a difficult or failed airway:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Difficult airway</strong> &ndash; A difficult airway is present when a clinician experiences problems with face mask ventilation, laryngoscopy, or intubation. In an emergency setting, this also includes difficulty performing an emergency surgical airway, such as needle cricothyroidotomy. Pediatric causes include congenital anomalies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79504\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79504 \">table 1</a>), epiglottitis, anaphylaxis, airway trauma, and airway foreign bodies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-difficult-pediatric-airway#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The difficult pediatric airway&quot;, section on 'Causes of the difficult pediatric airway'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Whenever possible, a difficult pediatric airway should be identified prior to endotracheal intubation attempts (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-difficult-pediatric-airway#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The difficult pediatric airway&quot;, section on 'Identification of the difficult pediatric airway'</a>). In any child in whom laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation is anticipated to be difficult, an alternative plan that involves the use of devices that enhance the clinician&rsquo;s ability to visualize and intubate the trachea should be employed, and the clinician with the greatest experience and skills should perform the intubation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58510%7EEM%2F63518%7EEM%2F73509\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef58510 graphicRef63518 graphicRef73509 \">algorithm 1A-C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Failed airway</strong> &ndash; There is no accepted single definition of a &quot;failed&quot; airway. Many authorities suggest that if an operator cannot place a definitive airway in three attempts after changing blade type and length once each, then he or she should consider the attempt failed and change to a different technique or allow a different operator to try. Others have stated that an alternative technique is indicated any time the patient's oxygen saturation falls below 90 percent during an intubation attempt.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A contingency plan in the event of a failed endotracheal intubation should be developed for all patients, ideally before rapid sequence intubation is necessary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73112\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef73112 \">algorithm 2</a>). Clinicians should have rescue devices available whenever performing emergent pediatric intubation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-rescue-devices-for-difficult-pediatric-airway-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency rescue devices for difficult pediatric airway management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8355373\"><span class=\"h1\">CHOICE OF DEVICE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of device depends upon the specific obstacles to conventional endotracheal intubation that are encountered or anticipated during direct laryngoscopy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Able to see epiglottis but not vocal cords</strong> &ndash; Intubating introducer (gum elastic bougie)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Unable to visualize airway</strong> &ndash; Lighted stylet, fiberoptic stylet, flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope, indirect fiberscope, or video laryngoscope</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Limited mouth opening or neck mobility</strong> &ndash; Lighted stylet, fiberoptic stylet, flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope, or indirect rigid laryngoscope</p><p/><p>In some cases, a combination of devices is employed to secure the airway. (See <a href=\"#H8355493\" class=\"local\">'Techniques'</a> below.)</p><p>Choice of device is also influenced by the clinical experience of the provider. Use of devices that require extensive training and practice (eg, the lighted stylet or fiberoptic bronchoscope) should typically be limited to those providers with regular exposure to difficult pediatric airways (eg, pediatric anesthesiologists).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8355596\"><span class=\"h2\">Training</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The choice of device depends upon the training and experience of the practitioner. Many of the devices for difficult endotracheal intubation require some assembly prior to use, and all require orientation and training. Inexperienced operators should <strong>not</strong> use these devices without prior practice. Just as providers must learn to use a standard laryngoscope, they must be trained to use advanced airway devices. Ideally, this training should be conducted first in a manikin or cadaver model and then, when possible, in an operating room setting.</p><p>The degree of training depends upon the expected frequency with which the clinician will encounter a difficult pediatric airway:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All providers should have training and experience in the use of rescue airway devices. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-rescue-devices-for-difficult-pediatric-airway-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency rescue devices for difficult pediatric airway management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Providers who are only occasionally exposed to difficult pediatric airways should gain capability with a limited number of relatively easy to use devices (eg, intubating introducers, fiberoptic stylet, or video laryngoscope). It is unlikely that an individual provider will have access to all possible devices so it is most important that providers learn to use the devices available to them.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Providers whose exposure to difficult pediatric airways is extensive (eg, pediatric anesthesiologists, emergency physicians in busy departments with high acuity, and critical care subspecialists) should develop facility with a wide variety of devices, including those that require repeated use to be most effective (eg, lighted stylet, flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8355493\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major devices for difficult endotracheal intubation in children include specialized stylets, indirect rigid laryngoscopes, and video laryngoscopes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15750903\"><span class=\"h2\">Specialized stylets</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18429511\"><span class=\"h3\">Intubating introducers (gum elastic bougie)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In adults, multiple randomized trials and observational studies have shown that intubating introducers facilitate intubation, especially in patients with Cormack-Lehane system grade 3 glottic views (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55034\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55034 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=devices-for-difficult-emergency-airway-management-outside-the-operating-room-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Devices for difficult emergency airway management outside the operating room in adults&quot;, section on 'Endotracheal tube introducers (gum elastic bougie)'</a>.).</p><p>The same benefit is probably achieved in children although reports of pediatric use are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In one operating room series, the use of a bougie with paraglossal laryngoscopy allowed intubation in five of six infants with Pierre Robin syndrome who could not be intubated with conventional laryngoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Additional case reports have demonstrated that the gum elastic bougie can be an effective adjunct to pediatric nasotracheal intubation, the insertion of the Pro Seal laryngeal mask airway, and prehospital tracheal intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. One case report describes the use of Boussignac bougie (bougie that permits oxygen delivery during placement) passed through a size one Laryngeal Mask Airway to successfully intubate an infant with Goldenhar syndrome after several attempts at direct laryngoscopy failed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Indications</strong> &ndash; Intubating introducers are helpful when the epiglottis is visible but the vocal cords cannot be seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. These devices are semi-rigid solid or hollow rods with the distal tip bent at a 30 degree angle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55895\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55895 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63503\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63503 \">picture 2</a>). The bend allows the intubator to direct the tip anteriorly under the epiglottis and through the vocal cords. Once the introducer is placed in the trachea, an endotracheal tube (ETT) is threaded over it using a Seldinger-like technique. This approach generally requires an assistant to place the ETT on the proximal end of the introducer. The intubator then advances the ETT over the introducer into the trachea and the introducer is withdrawn. Depending upon the manufacturer, intubating introducers are available in sizes as small as 8 Fr. These can be used with ETTs that have an internal diameter of at least 3.0 mm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Intubating introducers can be used in conjunction with fiberoptic intubation techniques (see <a href=\"#H15751198\" class=\"local\">'Fiberoptic stylets'</a> below and <a href=\"#H13595755\" class=\"local\">'Flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope'</a> below and <a href=\"#H18429730\" class=\"local\">'Indirect rigid laryngoscopy'</a> below) or video laryngoscopy (see <a href=\"#H18429782\" class=\"local\">'Video laryngoscope'</a> below). They can also be used to secure a definitive airway using some supraglottic devices (eg, laryngeal mask airway) as conduits. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-rescue-devices-for-difficult-pediatric-airway-management#H8354652\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency rescue devices for difficult pediatric airway management&quot;, section on 'Laryngeal mask airway (LMA)'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Contraindications</strong> &ndash; Intubating introducers are unlikely to be beneficial when the airway anatomy is not visible. In addition, airway guides should be used with caution when there is possible laryngeal or tracheal injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Technique:</strong></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lubricate the guide so that the ETT will pass over it easily.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Using direct or video laryngoscopy, identify the epiglottis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pass the airway guide (with its curved tip up) beneath the epiglottis. Entry into the trachea is associated with the tactile sensation of running the tip of the airway guide along the rigid rings of the trachea. This is sometimes described as a feeling similar to running your finger along an irregular surface. If the airway guide is in the trachea, it will also wedge into the small airways and not pass any further. In contrast, if the guide has entered the esophagus, no such sensation will be felt and no clear stopping point will be reached. Thus, the guide should be advanced into the trachea and moved back and forth (gently) a few times to insure that it is in the correct location.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Once certain that the airway guide rests within the trachea, insert the proximal end of the guide into the distal end of an appropriately-sized ETT and advance the tube along the guide (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63503\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63503 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Using direct laryngoscopy (DL) or video laryngoscopy (VL), advance the ETT until it rests within the trachea. Alternatively, if DL is not used, advance the ETT over the bougie into the trachea, carefully noting the depth of insertion indicated by the ETT marking at the gum line or incisor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Remove the guide and confirm the position of the ETT using an end-tidal CO2 detector. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-endotracheal-intubation-in-children#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency endotracheal intubation in children&quot;, section on 'Confirming tube position'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pitfalls</strong> &ndash; Excessive force while advancing the airway guide or the ETT can damage the trachea or larynx. In addition, the ETT, especially a cuffed tube, might become impeded by the epiglottis during placement. This problem can be overcome by using direct laryngoscopy or video laryngoscopy during the procedure <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> by rotating the ETT 90 degrees as it approaches the larynx. If the procedure takes a considerable period of time to perform, the patient can become hypoxemic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Based upon a single animal study, hollow exchange catheters that are used to administer oxygen have the potential to cause barotrauma if the catheter is advanced below the carina, regardless of the oxygen flow rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Thus, when hollow exchange catheters are used to administer oxygen during intubation attempts or tracheal tube changes, the tip of the catheter should remain above the carina.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15751030\"><span class=\"h3\">Lighted stylet</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lighted stylet permits ETT placement &quot;blindly&quot; without direct visualization of the vocal cords. The major disadvantages of the lightwand technique include longer times to intubation and lower success rate for inexperienced users (fewer than 20 intubations using the device) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Thus, for clinicians with limited opportunity to manage difficult pediatric airways, most experts would recommend use of a device which is easier to learn and use (eg, fiberoptic stylet). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-difficult-pediatric-airway#H4073370\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The difficult pediatric airway&quot;, section on 'Lighted stylet'</a>.)</p><p>However, for clinicians experienced with its use, the lighted stylet compares favorably with other methods and may be preferred in patients with cervical spine instability as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a case series of 30 children age 5 to 20 years with known difficult airways, endotracheal intubation using a lighted stylet was successful in 97 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. An additional case report describes successful use of a lightwand for intubation of an 18 day old infant with microsomia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an observational study of 153 endotracheal intubations that compared the lightwand with several other devices in adult cadavers with artificially created unstable upper cervical spines, the lightwand was associated with significantly less flexion and extension and less axial rotation than the Macintosh laryngoscope, the Airtraq laryngoscope, and the intubating laryngeal mask airway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p>The technique below describes the use of one of the most commonly available lighted stylets, the Trachlight (Laerdal Medical Corp) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This device contains a reusable battery <span class=\"nowrap\">pack/handle</span> and a flexible wand with a retractable metal stylet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63169\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63169 \">picture 3</a>). Wands are available in three sizes (adult, child, and infant) which means that this tool can be used with ETTs sized 2.5 to 10.0 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57820\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57820 \">picture 4</a>). Specific descriptions for the use of other types of lighted stylets may be obtained from their manufacturers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Indications</strong> &ndash; The lighted stylet will be most useful when the patient has limited mouth opening or neck mobility or when blood or secretions make visualization of the airway difficult. In experienced hands it may be one of the methods of choice for intubation of patients with cervical spine instability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. It can be used in conjunction with the intubating laryngeal mask airway as an intubation guide or with direct laryngoscopy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-rescue-devices-for-difficult-pediatric-airway-management#H8354689\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency rescue devices for difficult pediatric airway management&quot;, section on 'Intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILMA)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-endotracheal-intubation-in-children#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency endotracheal intubation in children&quot;, section on 'Laryngoscopy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Contraindications</strong> &ndash; Because tracheal intubation using the lighted stylet is a &quot;blind&quot; technique, its success is somewhat dependent upon the patient having relatively normal airway anatomy. In patients who are likely to have significantly distorted airways (eg, neck trauma with an expanding hematoma), this technique may fail and is not recommended.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Technique</strong> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/1,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Select an appropriately sized and type of ETT. If using a cuffed tube, inspect and test its balloon.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Identify the correct wand, and lubricate both its external surface and the retractable metal stylet.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Mount the stylet on the handle and test the light to ensure that it is functioning. It may be necessary to replace the batteries in the handle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pass the ETT over the stylet and then move the stylet along its track until it rests in a position roughly even with the Murphy eye of the ETT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lock the adapter of the ETT into position using the special clamp located on the handle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Insure that the rigid metal stylet is seated in the notch at the top of the wand.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Inspect the patient's thyromental distance; the distance between the top of the thyroid cartilage and chin. Bend the wand so that the portion distal to the bend is about as long as the patient's thyromental distance. Note that although the tube has an indicator noting the suggested location of the bend, the thyromental distance is a more accurate guide.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the intubation will be attempted with the patient's head in a neutral position, the wand should be bent at a 90 degree angle. An extended neck requires more than 90 degrees of bend, and a flexed neck requires less.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If desired, have an assistant dim the room lights to make the light from the wand easier to see.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Standing above the patient's head, grasp the lightwand in your dominant hand, and gently lift the patient's mandible with your nondominant hand.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Insert the lightwand between the patient's incisors keeping it aligned as closely as possible with the midline.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Switch on the light and advance the tip of the lightwand beneath the tongue. At this point the handle and the portion of the wand proximal to the bend should be parallel to the patient's body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Gently pull the handle back toward your body while cocking your wrist rostrally so that the handle is now perpendicular to the patient's body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Look for an intense glow that seems to emanate exclusively from the patient's thyroid cartilage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74936\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74936 \">picture 5</a>) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> feel the ETT pass through the vocal cords. A glow that is dim, diffuse, or seen lateral to the midline suggests that the ETT is not in the trachea. In this situation, remove the wand and ETT and ventilate the patient before trying again.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the intense glow is seen within the thyroid cartilage, advance the ETT and wand while simultaneously withdrawing the rigid metal stylet.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>When the light is visible in the patient's suprasternal notch, then the ETT rests below the vocal cords.

These include: the Bullard rigid fiberoptic laryngoscope (CIRCON ACMI); the Upsher Laryngoscope (Mercury Medical); and the Wu Laryngoscope (Pentax). These devices can be especially useful for intubation of patients in whom standard laryngoscopy might prove difficult (eg, limited neck mobility, <span class=\"nowrap\">Mallampati/Cormack-Lehane</span> Class III and IV airways (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55034\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55034 \">figure 1</a>)) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, like all fiberoptic devices, blood, vomitus, and excessive secretions can limit visibility through the fiberscope. Alternative devices are often preferred in patients with significant oral or laryngeal trauma. Furthermore, these laryngoscopes are not sized for intubating children less than two years of age. This section discusses in detail only the use of the Bullard laryngoscope. The other indirect fiberscopes are used in a fashion similar to this device.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18429737\"><span class=\"h3\">Bullard rigid fiberoptic laryngoscope</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Bullard laryngoscope is available in three sizes, adult, pediatric, and infant (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76535\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76535 \">picture 7</a>). Except for size, all are identical. The lower portion of the Bullard is a long metal blade with a curve near its distal end. Running behind the blade and ending just proximal to its tip are several ports. These include a fiberoptic light port which directs light into the airway, an optical port which allows visualization of the airway through the eyepiece, and a hollow port which can be used for suction, insufflation, or as a conduit through which a guidewire may be passed. This latter feature allows facilitated retrograde intubation with the Bullard. There are two optional attachments for the Bullard. The first is a stylet which attaches to the right side of the device and allows the ETT to be mounted beneath the right side of the blade. This stylet is available in two types: a standard semi-rigid, malleable type that simply serves to hold the ETT in position prior to deployment, and a hollow type that can accommodate an airway guide, bronchoscope, or guidewire sized 4 mm in diameter or smaller. The other optional attachment is a tip extender for the blade. This device might be needed if the Bullard is used to intubate a large adolescent. The Bullard's light may be powered by a standard fiberoptic light source or by the batteries in a laryngoscope handle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Indications</strong> &ndash; The Bullard laryngoscope is most useful when intubating patients with limited mouth opening or neck mobility and in those with predicted difficult airways due to poor visualization <span class=\"nowrap\">(Mallampati/Cormack-Lehane</span> Class III and IV).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This technique can be used in conjunction with wire or intubating introducer-assisted intubation. A guidewire can be passed through the hollow port beneath the blade or through the hollow stylet. An intubating introducer (eg, gum elastic bougie) can only be passed through the hollow stylet.

Multiple studies have compared video laryngoscopes with direct laryngoscopy (DL) in simulated difficult pediatric airway models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/29,41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,41-43</a>] and during patient care in the operating room, emergency department (ED), and the intensive care unit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/23,24,36,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24,36,44,45</a>]. In a review of a multicenter difficult airway database that included operating room intubation with video laryngoscopy of almost 800 children with suspected difficult airways (379 who had failed direct laryngoscopy), video laryngoscopy was associated with first-pass success of 51 percent and overall success of 79 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. On adjusted analysis, this first-pass success rate was not significantly different than flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy with intubation through a supraglottic airway (FOI-SGA). However, FOI-SGA was associated with a higher overall success rate (89 percent) and a better first-pass success among infants younger than 12 months of age than video laryngoscopy (54 versus 36 percent, respectively). Of note, all of these children were undergoing elective procedures and could be oxygenated during preparation and performance of FOI-SGA. </p><p>However, in otherwise normal children undergoing intubation by experienced providers, the use of video laryngoscopy compared with direct laryngoscopy is not necessarily associated with improved outcomes such as fewer adverse events or first-pass success rate and may result in longer intubation times: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a meta-analysis of 12 studies that reported on a total of 803 normal children undergoing elective intubation in the operating room by experienced anesthesiologists, use of indirect laryngoscopy (primarily video laryngoscopy) required a longer time for endotracheal tube placement (although subgroup analysis found no difference for children intubated with an AIRTRAQ device) and no significant difference on first-pass successful intubation (11 trials, 749 children) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/devices-for-difficult-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In five trials (263 patients), unsuccessful intubation was significantly increased in children intubated using indirect laryngoscopy. Use of indirect laryngoscopy did improve the percent of glottic opening visualized in five trials (256 children) but not Cormack and Lehane score (three trials, 190 children).
