Many families with HDGC have germline mutations in the E-cadherin (<em>CDH1</em>) gene that are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. The lifetime risk of gastric cancer in individuals from these families is very high, and the median age at diagnosis is only 38. As a result, prophylactic total gastrectomy is usually advised, generally between ages 20 and 30.</p><p>This topic will provide a detailed overview of HDGC, focusing on the identification of high-risk families and genetic counseling and testing. The molecular pathogenesis of this disorder and technical aspects of prophylactic total gastrectomy for patients with HDGC are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-and-molecular-pathogenesis-of-gastric-cancer#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology and molecular pathogenesis of gastric cancer&quot;, section on 'Diffuse type cancers'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MOLECULAR GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HDGC is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with high penetrance. Germline truncating mutations of the <em>CDH1</em> gene, located on chromosome 16q22.1, were originally described in three Maori families from New Zealand that were predisposed to diffuse gastric cancer. Subsequently, germline <em>CDH1</em> mutations have been identified in approximately 15 to 50 percent of affected kindreds that meet the clinical criteria for HDGC, as defined by the International Gastric Cancer Linkage Consortium (IGCLC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Identification of high-risk families'</a> below.)</p><p>The wide range of this estimate has to do with both the background incidence of gastric cancer and the criteria used to define the syndrome:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the most part, the frequency of mutation detection varies inversely with the background incidence of gastric cancer. Thus <em>CDH1</em> mutation detection rates in families meeting HDGC criteria are highest (40 to 52.6 percent) in lower-incidence countries like Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] and lower in moderate-incidence countries like Germany (25 percent), and lowest in high-incidence countries like Portugal and Italy (22.2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] and Japan (15.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A more recent series of 183 index cases meeting the 2010 IGCLC clinical criteria for <em>CDH1</em> testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] from Canada, Portugal, and Italy reported a lower than expected detection rate for a pathogenic <em>CDH1</em> mutation (19 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, across 144 <em>CDH1 </em>mutation-negative HDGC probands, other potential candidate mutations were identified in 16 (11 percent), including mutations in <em>CTNNA1</em> (the gene for alpha-catenin), <em>BRCA2</em> (the gene associated with Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer syndrome), <em>STK11</em> (the gene associated with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome), <em>SDHB</em>, <em>PRSS1</em>, <em>ATM</em>, <em>MSR1</em>, and <em>PALB2</em>. Of clinical importance, in low incidence countries, the criteria used to define HDGC can be relaxed with little effect on mutation detection rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Detection rates for <em>CDH1</em> mutations before 2010, using guidelines established in 1999, were 25 to 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Using newer updated criteria, <em>CDH1</em> detection rates in countries with a low incidence of gastric cancer has decreased to 10 to 18 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/1,5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Historical criteria for genetic testing'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1594315\" class=\"local\">'Updated criteria for genetic testing'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>To date, over 155 different germline <em>CDH1</em> mutations have been identified; the majority are pathogenic mutations but a number of variants of uncertain significance (VUS) have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. The majority have been single nucleotide substitutions leading to non-synonymous changes (splice site or truncating mutations); less commonly, there are insertions or deletions of several base-pairs leading to frameshifts with protein truncation. Approximately 5 percent of familial cases are due to large deletions involving multiple exons of the gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/2,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,9</a>]. All germline mutations are evenly distributed along the gene and lead to functional haploinsufficiency of E-cadherin.</p><p><em>CDH1</em> is a tumor suppressor gene, and therefore a somatic second hit is required for initiation of tumor formation. The trigger and molecular mechanism by which the second allele of E-cadherin is inactivated appears to be diverse, and includes promoter hypermethylation, mutation, and loss of heterozygosity. The end result is loss of expression of the cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin. This topic is discussed in more detail elsewhere.

The average age of onset of HDGC is 38 years, although it ranges from 14 to 82 years.</p><p>The gastric cancers that develop in these individuals are often multifocal and located beneath an intact mucosal surface. Histologically, individual tumor cells are seen to invade the surrounding tissues, and there is no gland formation. In most cases, intracellular mucin is abundant, and it pushes aside the nucleus of the individual cells, resulting in the so-called signet ring carcinoma.

In the study cited above of 75 <em>CDH1</em> mutation-positive HDGC kindreds comprising 3858 probands&nbsp;(89 with breast cancer), the risk of breast cancer for females was 42 percent (95% CI, 23-68 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

The optimal breast cancer screening strategy in such women is unclear; however, current guidelines suggest that these women be managed similarly to other high-risk breast cancer conditions with annual breast MRI (which can be combined with mammography) starting at age 30, and the option of risk-reducing mastectomy should be discussed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/1,4,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,16</a>].

As noted above, in situ signet ring cells <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pagetoid spread of signet ring cells in the stomach are considered preinvasive forms of signet ring cell cancers.

Testing can also be achieved on DNA extracted from saliva. If unable to test an affected family member, another option is testing a sample from an unaffected relative who might be an obligate carrier. Although HDGC is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, and most patients who inherit the mutation will have the disease, 20 percent of carriers will not develop clinically significant disease; therefore in some cases, an unaffected obligate carrier can be identified. As an example, suppose that the index case had two unaffected parents. If there is evidence of affected members on one side of the family (for example, a maternal aunt was affected), then it is most likely that the mutation was inherited from an unaffected carrier mother, and she would be the most likely candidate for testing.</p><p>Another option is to test DNA from archived paraffin blocks from an affected family member. This is often impractical and should only be considered as a last resort.</p><p>Mutation testing is usually accomplished by direct sequencing of all coding regions of the gene including intron-exon boundaries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. As noted above, several different types of mutations can be found in HDGC families by sequencing, including nonsynonymous <span class=\"nowrap\">(missense/nonsense),</span> indels (in-frame <span class=\"nowrap\">/frameshift),</span> and splice site mutations. It is not known whether there are any <span class=\"nowrap\">genotypic/phenotype</span> correlations, and in particular, if any of the specific mutations in <em>CDH1</em> are associated with a different risk of gastric cancer. Once a family mutation has been identified, it is simple to set up a mutation-specific assay to assess the mutation status of family members. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Molecular genetics'</a> above.)</p><p>Some intragenic deletions have been discovered in families where no mutation was evident by sequencing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Thus, screening for large genomic deletions with multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) or alternative methods is recommended in cases where DNA sequencing is unrevealing.</p><p>The optimal age to screen individuals from affected families is unclear. Rare cases of diffuse gastric cancer have been reported in affected families before the age of 18, but the overall risk of cancer before age 20 is very low (less than 1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/6,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,12</a>]. The risk rises to 4 percent by age 30 without prophylactic surgery. Most groups agree that consideration of genetic testing can begin at the age of informed consent (16 or 18 years of age depending on the geographic place of residence) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/1,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13</a>]. However, decisions as to the age at which to institute testing should also take into account the earliest age of cancer onset in the individual family.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF MUTATION CARRIERS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H438912839\"><span class=\"h2\">Prophylactic gastrectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prophylactic total gastrectomy is recommended for any individual with an appropriate pedigree who has been shown to have a germline <em>CDH1</em> mutation. </p><p>Prophylactic gastrectomy is often advised between age 20 and 30 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, while the mean age of onset of diffuse gastric cancer is approximately 38, there are certain kindreds where the mean age of onset is much younger. Some suggest consideration of total gastrectomy in <em>CDH1</em> mutation carriers at an age five years younger than the youngest family member who developed gastric cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>The timing of surgery may also vary according to the preferences and physical as well as psychological fitness of the individual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Careful inspection of the mucosa with photodocumentation of any abnormal areas and an assessment of distensibility on inflation are important.

In addition, due to the tiny foci of signet ring cells, which can only be recognized by microscopic analysis, multiple random biopsies are required to maximize the likelihood of identifying them [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. A minimum of 30 biopsies is recommended, with 5 biopsies taken from each of the following anatomical zones: pre-pyloric area, antrum, transitional zone, body, fundus, and cardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

With the inclusion of <em>CDH1</em> on many germline multigene cancer panels, primarily because of its role as a high-penetrance breast cancer risk allele [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>], individuals may be identified as having a <em>CDH1</em> mutation but without a personal or family history of diffuse gastric cancer or lobular breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. In other situations, an individual may be identified as having a <em>CDH1</em> variant of uncertain significance or a disease-conferring <em>CDH1</em> mutation after presenting with a phenotypically consistent tumor but without any family history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. Both germline and somatic <em>CDH1</em> mutations can also be identified through the molecular examination of tumors by tumor sequencing. Whether the mutation is inherited or not can only be distinguished by examination of germline DNA.</p><p>Current recommendations for management of <em>CDH1</em> mutation carriers are based on data generated from high-penetrant HDGC families and, therefore, may not reflect the risk for individuals with an incidentally detected <em>CDH1</em> mutation. Due to the lack of prospective data available regarding the penetrance of <em>CDH1</em> mutations identified in scenarios outside of personal and family histories that are phenotypically consistent with HDGC, caution is required with regard to assessment and counseling of these individuals. Referral to centers with experience in this setting is critical for cases such as these where current guidelines recommending total prophylactic gastrectomy are not easily applied. At the very least, any individual identified with a <em>CDH1</em> mutation should follow the endoscopy screening protocol while deferring total prophylactic gastrectomy. (See <a href=\"#H456763271\" class=\"local\">'HDGC endoscopic protocol'</a> above.)</p><p>The exact context under which the <em>CDH1</em> mutation has been identified is important to consider with regard to suggested management.

De novo mutations have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>], therefore a lack of a family history should not be interpreted as indicating a low penetrance mutation. Furthermore, lobular breast cancer may be the initial presentation in the family preceding a diffuse gastric cancer case [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/8,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11</a>]. Although families have been reported with LBC and no DGC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], it is not possible to be sure of the penetrance for diffuse gastric cancer in that kindred, and therefore, the situation is straight-forward in that standard HDGC recommendations should be followed, adhering to the endoscopy screening protocol while deferring total prophylactic gastrectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It is reasonable to manage an unaffected <em>CDH1 </em>mutation carrier from a family with a history that is only partially consistent with HDGC in a similar manner, based on the detection of early gastric cancer in prophylactic gastrectomy specimens of <em>CDH1 </em>mutation carriers from families whose background is suspicious for HDGC, but that do not strictly meet HDGC diagnostic criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hereditary-diffuse-gastric-cancer/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Detection of a <em>CDH1</em> mutation in a proband with a tumor not previously associated with the syndrome. In this scenario, the <em>CDH1</em> mutation may truly be an incidental finding that may not have been related to the tumor development, or alternatively it may represent an expanded phenotype not previously reported. These patients should be referred to specialist centers for further clinical evaluation and potentially tumor workup and segregation analysis in the research setting. At the very least, any individual identified with a <em>CDH1</em> mutation should follow the endoscopy screening protocol while deferring total prophylactic gastrectomy.
