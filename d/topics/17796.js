Effective treatments reduce serum calcium by inhibiting bone resorption, increasing urinary calcium excretion, or decreasing intestinal calcium absorption (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F73030\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73030 \">table 1</a>). The optimal choice varies with the cause and severity of hypercalcemia.</p><p>The treatment of hypercalcemia will be reviewed here, with emphasis on the management of hypercalcemia in patients with malignant disease. The modalities described below apply in varying degrees to patients with other causes of hypercalcemia. The clinical manifestations, etiology, and diagnostic approach to hypercalcemia are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hypercalcemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hypercalcemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-hypercalcemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of hypercalcemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-hypercalcemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to hypercalcemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INTERPRETATION OF SERUM CALCIUM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Calcium in serum is bound to proteins, principally albumin. As a result, total serum calcium concentrations in patients with low or high serum albumin levels may not accurately reflect the physiologically important ionized (or free) calcium concentration. As an example, in patients with hypoalbuminemia, total serum calcium concentration may be normal when serum ionized calcium is elevated.</p><p>Alternatively, patients with hyperalbuminemia due to severe volume depletion and rare patients with multiple myeloma, who have a calcium-binding paraprotein, have increased protein binding of calcium. This can cause an elevation in the serum total calcium concentration without any rise in the serum ionized calcium concentration. This phenomenon is called pseudohypercalcemia (or factitious hypercalcemia) since the patient has a normal ionized serum calcium concentration.</p><p>In patients with hypoalbuminemia or hyperalbuminemia, the measured serum calcium concentration should be corrected for the abnormality in albumin (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-calcium-correction-in-hypoalbuminemia\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) or for standard units (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-calcium-correction-in-hypoalbuminemia-si-units\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>). If a laboratory known to measure ionized calcium reliably is available, some authorities prefer to measure the serum ionized calcium in this situation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=relation-between-total-and-ionized-serum-calcium-concentrations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Relation between total and ionized serum calcium concentrations&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypercalcemia may be associated with a spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from few or no symptoms in patients with mild chronic hypercalcemia to severe obtundation and coma (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hypercalcemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hypercalcemia&quot;</a>). The degree of hypercalcemia, along with the rate of rise of serum calcium concentration, often determines symptoms and the urgency of therapy. The therapeutic approach should reflect these differences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypercalcemia/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>Patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic (eg, constipation) hypercalcemia (calcium &lt;12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> do not require immediate treatment (see <a href=\"#H1248397\" class=\"local\">'Preferred approach'</a> below). Similarly, a serum calcium of 12 to 14 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3 to 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> may be well tolerated chronically and may not require immediate treatment. However, an acute rise to these concentrations may cause marked changes in sensorium, which requires more aggressive measures. In addition, patients with a serum calcium concentration &gt;14 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> require treatment, regardless of symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1248397\"><span class=\"h1\">PREFERRED APPROACH</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1248476\"><span class=\"h2\">Mild hypercalcemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic hypercalcemia (calcium &lt;12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> do not require immediate treatment. However, they should be advised to avoid factors that can aggravate hypercalcemia, including thiazide diuretics and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a> carbonate therapy, volume depletion, prolonged bed rest or inactivity, and a high calcium diet (&gt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span>. Adequate hydration (at least six to eight glasses of water per day) is recommended to minimize the risk of nephrolithiasis. Additional therapy depends mostly upon the cause of the hypercalcemia. (See <a href=\"#H1248559\" class=\"local\">'Disease-specific approach'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1248482\"><span class=\"h2\">Moderate hypercalcemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals with chronic moderate hypercalcemia (calcium between 12 and 14 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [3 to 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> may not require immediate therapy. However, they should follow the same precautions described above for mild hypercalcemia.</p><p>It is important to note that an acute rise to these concentrations may cause marked changes in sensorium, which requires more aggressive therapy. In these patients, we typically treat with saline hydration and bisphosphonates, as described for severe hypercalcemia (below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1248513\"><span class=\"h2\">Severe hypercalcemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with calcium &gt;14 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> require more aggressive therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H869500054\"><span class=\"h3\">Immediate therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The acute therapy of patients with severe hypercalcemia consists of a three-pronged approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypercalcemia/abstract/1,2,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Volume expansion with isotonic saline at an initial rate of 200 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> that is then adjusted to maintain the urine output at 100 to 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span>. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Saline hydration'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the absence of renal failure or heart failure, loop diuretic therapy to directly increase calcium excretion is not recommended, because of potential complications and the availability of drugs that inhibit bone resorption, which is primarily responsible for the hypercalcemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administration of salmon <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitonin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitonin</a> (4 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg)</span> and repeat measurement of serum calcium in several hours. If a hypocalcemic response is noted, then the patient is calcitonin sensitive and the calcitonin can be repeated every 6 to 12 hours (4 to 8 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg)</span>. We typically administer calcitonin (along with a bisphosphonate) in patients with calcium &gt;14 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> who are also symptomatic. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Calcitonin'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The concurrent administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a> (ZA; 4 mg intravenously [IV] over 15 minutes) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pamidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pamidronate</a> (60 to 90 mg over two hours), preferably ZA because it is superior to pamidronate in reversing hypercalcemia related to malignancy.

The bisphosphonate will be effective by the second to fourth day, thereby maintaining control of the hypercalcemia.</p><p>Additional, more aggressive measures are necessary in the rare patient with very severe, symptomatic hypercalcemia. Hemodialysis should be considered, in addition to the above treatments, in patients who have serum calcium concentrations in the range of 18 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (4.5 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> and neurologic symptoms but a stable circulation or in those with severe hypercalcemia complicated by renal failure.

In patients with hypercalcemia of malignancy, progressive hypercalcemia will inevitably accompany tumor progression, and therefore, the underlying disease causing the hypercalcemia should be treated, if at all possible. Many patients with malignancy may also have metastatic bone disease and will receive IV ZA or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pamidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pamidronate</a> every three to four weeks as part of their treatment to prevent skeletal complications. As a result, recurrent hypercalcemia will be prevented.</p><p>For patients with severe, symptomatic hypercalcemia of malignancy that is refractory to ZA, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a> (initial dose 60 mg subcutaneously, with repeat dosing based upon response) is an alternative option. (See <a href=\"#H21004936\" class=\"local\">'Denosumab'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1248559\"><span class=\"h2\">Disease-specific approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The modalities described above apply in varying degrees to patients with all causes of hypercalcemia. The treatment of some disorders is discussed in detail in other topic reviews. Summarized briefly:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperparathyroidism is the most common outpatient cause of mild hypercalcemia. The treatment is typically directed at correcting the hyperparathyroidism or monitoring for complications of primary hyperparathyroidism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-hyperparathyroidism-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary hyperparathyroidism: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parathyroid carcinoma is a rare cause of hyperparathyroidism. Patients typically present with marked hypercalcemia and very high parathyroid hormone concentrations or a neck mass. The primary treatment of parathyroid carcinoma is surgery. When the tumor is no longer amenable to surgical intervention, treatment becomes focused on the control of hypercalcemia with medical therapy, which can include bisphosphonates, calcimimetic agents, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parathyroid-carcinoma#H3950406542\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parathyroid carcinoma&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with lymphoma, sarcoidosis, or other granulomatous causes of hypercalcemia have enhanced intestinal calcium absorption due to increased endogenous calcitriol production. The major modalities of therapy are a low calcium diet, corticosteroids, and treatment of the underlying disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypercalcemia-in-granulomatous-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypercalcemia in granulomatous diseases&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypercalcemia due to ingestion of calcitriol as treatment for hypoparathyroidism, or for the hypocalcemia and hyperparathyroidism of renal failure, usually lasts only one to two days because of the relatively short biologic half-life of calcitriol. Thus, stopping the calcitriol, increasing salt and fluid intake, or perhaps hydrating with IV saline may be the only therapy that is needed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Hypercalcemia caused by parent vitamin D or calcidiol lasts longer, so that more aggressive therapy such as glucocorticoids and ZA or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pamidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pamidronate</a> may be necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypercalcemia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypercalcemia is typically not treated in patients with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, because the elevation in serum calcium is typically mild and produces few if any symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders of the calcium-sensing receptor: Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia and autosomal dominant hypocalcemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">SALINE HYDRATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial therapy of severe hypercalcemia includes the simultaneous administration of saline, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitonin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitonin</a>, and a bisphosphonate (see <a href=\"#H1248513\" class=\"local\">'Severe hypercalcemia'</a> above). Isotonic saline corrects possible volume depletion due to hypercalcemia-induced urinary salt wasting and, in some cases, vomiting. Hypovolemia exacerbates hypercalcemia by impairing the renal clearance of calcium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F73030\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73030 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypercalcemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The rate of saline infusion depends upon several factors, including the severity of hypercalcemia, the age of the patient, and presence of comorbid conditions, particularly underlying cardiac or renal disease. A reasonable regimen, in the absence of edema, is the administration of isotonic saline at an initial rate of 200 to 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> that is then adjusted to maintain the urine output at 100 to 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span>.</p><p>Saline therapy requires careful monitoring since it can lead to fluid overload in patients who cannot excrete the administered salt because of impaired renal function, which can be induced by hypercalcemia or heart failure. The saline infusion should be stopped in patients who develop edema, and a loop diuretic may be used as necessary.</p><p>Saline therapy rarely normalizes the serum calcium concentration in patients with more than mild hypercalcemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypercalcemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In the past, administration of a loop diuretic was initiated routinely once fluid repletion had been achieved to further increase urinary calcium excretion. However, this practice was based upon an approach that involved intensive administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a> (80 to 100 mg every one to two hours) with aggressive fluid hydration (10 liters daily) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypercalcemia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Saline therapy beyond that necessary to restore euvolemia has fallen out of favor for two reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypercalcemia/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The availability of drugs such as the bisphosphonates and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitonin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitonin</a> that inhibit bone resorption, which is primarily responsible for the hypercalcemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The requirement for careful monitoring because of the potential fluid and electrolyte complications resulting from a massive saline infusion and furosemide-induced diuresis such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and volume depletion if the diuretic-induced losses are not replaced.</p><p/><p>Concurrent treatment with bisphosphonates with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitonin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitonin</a> is typically required to treat moderate to severe hypercalcemia.

Salmon calcitonin (4 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg)</span> is usually administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously every 12 hours; doses can be increased up to 6 to 8 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg</span> every six hours. Nasal application of calcitonin is not efficacious for treatment of hypercalcemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypercalcemia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitonin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Calcitonin</a> is safe and relatively nontoxic (other than mild nausea and the rare hypersensitivity reaction). Although a relatively weak agent, it works rapidly, lowering the serum calcium concentration by a maximum of 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.3 to 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> beginning within four to six hours (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F73030\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73030 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypercalcemia/abstract/1,4,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,13,14</a>]. Thus, it is useful in combination with hydration for the initial management of severe hypercalcemia.</p><p>The efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitonin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitonin</a> is limited to the first 48 hours, even with repeated doses, indicating the development of tachyphylaxis, perhaps due to receptor downregulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypercalcemia/abstract/1,11,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11,15,16</a>]. Because of its limited duration of effect, calcitonin is most beneficial in symptomatic patients with calcium &gt;14 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> (3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> when combined with hydration and bisphosphonates.

ZA is favored by some because it is more potent than pamidronate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypercalcemia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] and can be administered over a shorter time period (15 minutes compared with two hours).</p><p>The bisphosphonates are nonhydrolyzable analogs of inorganic pyrophosphate that adsorb to the surface of bone hydroxyapatite and inhibit calcium release by interfering with osteoclast-mediated bone resorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypercalcemia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. They are effective in treating hypercalcemia resulting from excessive bone resorption of any cause (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F73030\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73030 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-of-bisphosphonates\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology of bisphosphonates&quot;</a>.)</p><p>All of the bisphosphonates are relatively nontoxic compounds, and they are more potent than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitonin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitonin</a> and saline for patients with moderate or severe hypercalcemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypercalcemia/abstract/1,17,19-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,17,19-24</a>]. As a result, they have become the preferred agents for management of hypercalcemia due to excessive bone resorption from a variety of causes, including malignancy-related hypercalcemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypercalcemia/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. Their maximum effect occurs in two to four days, so that they are usually given in conjunction with saline <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> calcitonin, which reduce calcium concentration more rapidly. (See <a href=\"#H1248397\" class=\"local\">'Preferred approach'</a> above.)</p><p>Although bisphosphonates are most commonly used to treat established hypercalcemia, they have also been given to prevent hypercalcemia and adverse skeletal events, particularly in patients with metastatic cancer to bone. The use of bisphosphonates to improve outcomes for patients with cancer is discussed separately.

Some data suggest a higher risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw following the repeated use of ZA. As a result, some groups favor use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pamidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pamidronate</a> over ZA in particular cancer patients, such as those with multiple myeloma. However, osteonecrosis of the jaw is a complication of long-term, high-dose IV bisphosphonate therapy.

Although it can be administered over a shorter time period (15 minutes as compared with two hours), which may be more convenient, this may not be as important in the setting of hypercalcemia, since many of these patients require hospitalization. ZA is available in many countries for treatment of hypercalcemia of malignancy at a dose of 4 mg IV over at least 15 minutes.</p><p>In a pooled analysis of two separate phase III trials involving a total of 275 patients with tumor-induced hypercalcemia, a single dose of ZA (either 4 or 8 mg) normalized the corrected serum calcium concentration in 87 to 88 percent of patients, compared with only 70 percent of those receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pamidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pamidronate</a> (90 mg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypercalcemia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

In randomized trials of patients with multiple myeloma or metastatic breast cancer, the administration of oral clodronate to decrease skeletal complications was associated with fewer episodes of severe hypercalcemia. However, the poor oral bioavailability of clodronate, the size of the tablets, and the need to take them on an empty stomach with nothing to eat for one hour afterward increases the risk of noncompliance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypercalcemia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Clinical trials comparing ZA and denosumab in this setting are warranted.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Denosumab</a>, unlike bisphosphonates, is not cleared by the kidney, and as a consequence, there is no restriction of its use in patients with chronic kidney disease, for whom bisphosphonates are used with caution or contraindicated (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Dosing in renal impairment'</a> above). In case reports of patients with multiple myeloma, hypercalcemia, and severe renal impairment (serum creatinine 2.5 to 5.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL),</span> denosumab improved serum calcium within two to four days and, in one case, was associated with improvement in renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypercalcemia/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>]. Thus, denosumab may have a role in the treatment of hypercalcemia complicated by marked renal impairment or renal failure. However, the optimal dose of denosumab in the setting of renal impairment is uncertain. In trials of denosumab for osteoporosis, patients with chronic kidney disease were at higher risk for hypocalcemia following denosumab administration than patients with normal renal function (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-for-osteoporosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Denosumab for osteoporosis&quot;</a>). In a case series of denosumab for the treatment of hypercalcemia in patients with multiple myeloma and renal impairment, a single dose of denosumab (60 mg) in one patient resulted in prolonged hypocalcemia requiring intravenous (IV) calcium supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypercalcemia/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

It is also prudent to measure serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels, as patients with vitamin D deficiency may be more likely to develop hypocalcemia after denosumab administration. While awaiting the results of the serum 25(OH)D level, one could consider repleting with one or two days of vitamin D, 50,000 international units daily. If the patient is vitamin D deficient, it may help prevent hypocalcemia, and if they are vitamin D replete, the supplementation can be stopped.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Calcimimetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Calcimimetic agents (only <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cinacalcet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cinacalcet</a> is currently available) reduces the serum calcium concentration in patients with severe hypercalcemia due to parathyroid carcinoma and in hemodialysis patients with an elevated calcium-phosphorous product and secondary hyperparathyroidism.
