This procedure opens narrowed or blocked arteries in the heart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F61785\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61785 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Before the procedure, you will have a cardiac catheterization (also called &quot;cardiac cath&quot;). During this test, the doctor puts a thin plastic tube into a blood vessel in your leg or arm. Then he or she moves the end of the tube up to your heart. Next, the doctor puts a dye that shows up on X-ray into the tube. This part of the test is called &quot;coronary angiography.&quot; It can show how many of your heart arteries are blocked and how serious the blockages are.</p><p>Depending on the results, your doctor might do stenting right away. For this procedure, the doctor will advance another plastic tube to your heart. After it reaches the narrowed or blocked artery, the doctor will place a stent where the major blockage or blockages are. This opens up the artery at the place where it is blocked and helps restore blood flow to the heart.</p><p>A heart stent is a tiny metal tube about one inch long that helps prop open an artery in the heart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F86256\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86256 \">figure 2</a>). Many heart stents are coated with a medicine that helps keep the artery from getting narrow or blocked again.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88361219\"><span class=\"h1\">Why might I need a stent?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor might recommend a stent if you have coronary heart disease and have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain (&quot;called angina&quot;) that does not get better when you take medicines</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One or more heart arteries that are very narrow</p><p/><p>People who are having a heart attack or had a heart attack a short time ago also sometimes need stent placement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88361236\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I prepare for the procedure?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should not eat or drink anything for 6 to 8 hours before the procedure. You might need to change your medicines or stop taking some of them beforehand. Follow all the instructions your doctor gives you. If you don't feel well on the day of the procedure, tell your doctor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88361253\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after the procedure?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After the procedure, your doctor will remove the tube from your body and put pressure on the small cut to prevent bleeding. You might need to stay in the hospital overnight. Before you leave, your doctor will tell you when you can drive and do your usual activities again.</p><p>Your doctor will prescribe <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> and another medicine to help prevent clots inside the stent. It is very important that you take these medicines as directed and that you keep taking them unless your doctor says it's OK to stop. People who stop taking these medicines too soon increase their risk of a heart attack or even death.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88361270\"><span class=\"h1\">What problems can happen after the procedure?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common problems are bleeding, bruising, and soreness in the area where the tube was put in. These problems can last for a few days, especially if the tube was put in the leg.</p><p>Other problems can happen during or after stenting, but they are rare. They include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A small tear in the inside of a coronary artery, which usually heals by itself. Some people with this problem need another procedure or (in rare cases) surgery to fix the tear.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart damage</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A blood clot inside the stent. This can block blood flow to the heart and cause a heart attack or even death. It can happen as early as 1 day or as late as 1 year or more after you get a stent.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88361287\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call my doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Call your doctor or nurse if any of the following happen after your stenting:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have chest pain that does not get better with 1 dose of sublingual (under the tongue) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">nitroglycerin</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You get a fever or have pain, swelling, or redness where the tube went in</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88361304\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-catheterization-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cardiac catheterization (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chest-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chest pain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-heart-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Coronary heart disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-attack-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart attack (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-angina-chest-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for angina (chest pain) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-after-a-heart-attack-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines after a heart attack (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stenting-for-the-heart-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Stenting for the heart (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medications-for-angina-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Medications for angina (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=angina-treatment-medical-versus-interventional-therapy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Angina treatment &mdash; medical versus interventional therapy (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
