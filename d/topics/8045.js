It is present in approximately one-half of the world's population.</p><p>The vast majority of people infected with <em>H. pylori</em> has no symptoms and will never develop problems. However, <em>H. pylori</em> is capable of causing a number of digestive problems, including ulcers and, much less commonly, stomach cancer. It is not clear why some people with <em>H. pylori</em> get these conditions and others do not.</p><p>This article discusses the symptoms, testing, and treatment of <em>H. pylori</em> infections. Stomach ulcers, also known as peptic ulcers, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peptic-ulcer-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Peptic ulcer disease (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">H. PYLORI RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>H. pylori</em> is probably spread by consuming food or water contaminated with fecal matter. <em>H. pylori</em> causes changes to the stomach and duodenum (the first part of the small intestine) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F64960\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64960 \">figure 1</a>). The bacteria infect the protective tissue that lines the stomach. This leads to the release of certain enzymes and toxins and activation of the immune system. Together, these factors may directly or indirectly injure the cells of the stomach or duodenum. This causes chronic inflammation in the walls of the stomach (gastritis) or duodenum (duodenitis).</p><p>As a result of these changes, the stomach and duodenum are more vulnerable to damage from digestive juices, such as stomach acid.</p><p>In the United States and other developed countries, infection with <em>H. pylori</em> is unusual during childhood but becomes more common during adulthood. However, in developing countries, most children are infected with <em>H. pylori</em> before age 10.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">H. PYLORI SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most individuals with chronic gastritis or duodenitis have no symptoms. However, some people develop more serious problems, including stomach or duodenal ulcers.</p><p>Ulcers can cause a variety of symptoms or no symptoms at all, with the most common ulcer symptoms including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain or discomfort (usually in the upper abdomen)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bloating</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling full after eating a small amount of food</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of appetite</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea or vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dark or tar-colored stools</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ulcers that bleed can cause a low blood count and fatigue (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peptic-ulcer-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Peptic ulcer disease (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p>Less commonly, chronic gastritis causes abnormal changes in the stomach lining, which can lead to certain forms of cancer. It is uncommon to develop cancer as a result of <em>H. pylori</em> infection. Nevertheless, because so many people in the world are infected with <em>H. pylori</em>, it is considered to be an important cause of stomach cancer. People who live in countries in which <em>H. pylori</em> infection occurs at an early age are at greatest risk of stomach cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">H. PYLORI DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several ways to diagnose <em>H. pylori</em>. The most commonly used tests include the following:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Breath tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breath tests (known as urea breath tests) require that you drink a specialized solution containing a substance that is broken down by the <em>H. pylori</em> bacterium. The breakdown products can be detected in your breath.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Stool tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tests are available that detect <em>H. pylori</em> proteins in stool.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H249862275\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood tests can detect specific antibodies (proteins) that the body's immune system develops in response to the <em>H. pylori</em> bacterium. However, concerns over its accuracy have limited its use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">WHO SHOULD BE TESTED FOR H. PYLORI?</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">If you have symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnostic testing for <em>H. pylori</em> infection is recommended if you have active gastric or duodenal ulcers or if you have a past history of ulcers.</p><p>Although <em>H. pylori</em> infection is the most common cause of ulcers, not all patients with ulcers have <em>H. pylori</em>. Certain medications (eg, aspirin, ibuprofen [Motrin, Advil], naproxen [Aleve]) can also cause peptic ulcers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peptic-ulcer-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Peptic ulcer disease (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">If you do not have symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>H. pylori</em> testing is usually not recommended if you have no symptoms and no past history of peptic ulcer disease. However, it may be considered for selected people, such as those with a family history or concern about stomach cancer, particularly individuals of Chinese, Korean, Japanese, or Central American descent; these groups have a higher incidence of stomach cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">H. PYLORI TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with a history of peptic ulcer disease, active gastric ulcer, or active duodenal ulcer associated with <em>H. pylori</em> infection should be treated. Successful treatment of <em>H. pylori</em> can help the ulcer to heal, prevent ulcers from coming back, and reduce the risk of ulcer complications (like bleeding).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No single drug cures <em>H. pylori</em> infection. Most treatment regimens involve taking several medications for 14 days.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most of the treatment regimens include a medication called a proton pump inhibitor. This medication decreases the stomach's production of acid, which allows the tissues damaged by the infection to heal. Examples of proton pump inhibitors include lansoprazole (Prevacid), omeprazole (Prilosec), pantoprazole (Protonix), rabeprazole (AcipHex), dexlansoprazole (Dexilant), and esomeprazole (Nexium). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two antibiotics are also generally recommended; this reduces the risk of treatment failure and antibiotic resistance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are increasing numbers of patients with <em>H. pylori</em> infection that is resistant to antibiotics, so it is important to take all the medications prescribed and to have a test that confirms that the infection has been cleared.</p><p/><p>For <em>H. pylori</em> treatment to be effective, it is important to take the entire course of all medications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Up to 50 percent of patients have side effects while taking <em>H. pylori</em> treatment. Side effects are usually mild, and fewer than 10 percent of patients stop treatment because of side effects. For those who do experience side effects, it may be possible to make adjustments in the dose or timing of medication. Some of the most common side effects are described below.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some of the treatment regimens use a medication called metronidazole (Flagyl) or clarithromycin (Biaxin). These medications can cause a metallic taste in the mouth.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Alcoholic beverages (eg, beer, wine) should be avoided while taking metronidazole; the combination can cause skin flushing, headache, nausea, vomiting, sweating, and a rapid heart rate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bismuth, which is contained in some of the regimens, causes the stool to become black and may cause constipation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many of the regimens cause diarrhea and stomach cramps.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Up to 20 percent of patients with <em>H. pylori</em> infection are not cured after completing their first course of treatment. A second treatment regimen is usually recommended in this case. Retreatment usually requires that the patient take 14 days of a proton pump inhibitor and two antibiotics. At least one of the antibiotics is different from those used in the first treatment course.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Follow-up</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After completing <em>H. pylori</em> treatment, repeat testing is usually performed to ensure that the infection has resolved. This is typically done with a breath or stool test (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Breath tests'</a> above). Blood tests are not recommended for follow up testing; the antibody detected by the blood test often remains in the blood for four or more months after treatment, even after the infection is eliminated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Helicobacter pylori</em>, also known as <em>H. pylori</em>, is a bacterium that is commonly found in the stomach. Most people infected with <em>H. pylori</em> have no problems. However, some people develop problems, such as stomach ulcers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ulcers may cause no symptoms, or may cause pain or discomfort (usually in the upper abdomen), bloating, feeling full after eating a small amount of food, lack of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and dark or tar-colored stools. Ulcers that bleed can cause a low blood count.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>H. pylori</em> can be diagnosed with a test of the blood, breath, or stool.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>H. pylori</em> testing is recommended for anyone with a peptic (stomach or duodenal) ulcer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anyone diagnosed with <em>H. pylori</em> should be treated. <em>H. pylori</em> treatment helps to heal the ulcer, lowers the risk that the ulcer will return, and lowers the risk of bleeding from the ulcer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>H. pylori</em> treatment usually includes several medicines. At least two of the medicines are antibiotics that help to kill the bacteria. The other medication causes the stomach to make less acid; lower acid levels help the ulcer to heal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most people are cured after finishing one to two weeks of medicine. Some people need to take another two weeks of medicine. It is important to finish all of the medicine to ensure that the bacteria are killed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A breath or stool test is usually done after finishing the medication. This is done to be sure that the bacteria were killed.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our website (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=2012\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
