As aortic stenosis (AS) develops, a minimal valve gradient is present until the orifice area becomes less than half of normal. The natural history of AS therefore begins with a prolonged asymptomatic period associated with minimal mortality.</p><p>Serial hemodynamic examinations in several studies show that progressive valve obstruction occurs in nearly all adults with calcific aortic valve disease once even mild valve obstruction is present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F81124\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81124 \">figure 1</a>). Patients remain asymptomatic as aortic velocity increases and valve area decreases until the severity of obstruction results in an inadequate cardiac output with exercise leading to symptom onset.

However, many patients do not develop symptoms until even more severe valve obstruction is present, and some patients with less severe AS or with mixed stenosis and regurgitation are symptomatic.

Although retrospective studies of statin therapy were promising, a large randomized prospective study demonstrated that statin therapy does not prevent disease progression. However, many patients meet criteria for statin therapy based on standard risk factor evaluation and should be treated according to guidelines. In addition, most adults with AS have concurrent cardiac conditions that require therapy, including hypertension, coronary heart disease, atrial fibrillation, and left ventricular dysfunction.</p><p>The medical management of patients with asymptomatic AS will be reviewed here.

Echocardiography also provides information about left ventricular function and associated lesions, and is an important part of an integrated approach that includes a detailed history, a careful physical examination, and evaluation of exercise tolerance, in selected cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-asymptomatic-aortic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Invasive hemodynamic evaluation is not recommended in asymptomatic patients. Patients should receive education about the expected disease course and symptoms that should be reported such as dyspnea, reduced exercise tolerance, exertional chest pain, lightheadedness, and syncope.

In patients with Stage B mild AS (transvalvular velocity 2 to 2.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/s),</span> echocardiography is recommended every three to five years.

In patients with asymptomatic Stage C1 severe AS (transvalvular velocity 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/s</span> or higher), echocardiography is recommended every 6 to 12 months. Echocardiography is indicated earlier than the standard interval if there is a change in symptoms or signs suggestive of worsening cardiac status. </p><p>In patients with mild or greater AS, there is a progressive reduction in aortic valve area that averages 0.1 cm<sup>2</sup><span class=\"nowrap\">/year</span> and a progressive increase in aortic jet velocity that averages 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/sec</span> per year, with considerable variation between patients in the rate of progression. Risk factors for hemodynamics progression include a smaller valve area, left ventricular hypertrophy, and moderate to severe valve calcification. </p><p>Asymptomatic patients with severe AS have a low rate of survival free from valve replacement (56 to 63 percent at two years and 25 to 33 percent at four to five years in two studies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-asymptomatic-aortic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

On a worldwide basis, primary prevention of rheumatic fever is important to prevent aortic and mitral valve disease initiation, however there is no evidence that secondary prevention of rheumatic fever will prevent disease progression once AS is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-asymptomatic-aortic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Rheumatic fever is now an uncommon disease in developed countries in which most cases of AS are due to calcific disease of a congenitally bicuspid or anatomically normal trileaflet aortic valve.

No significant differences were found between the two treatment groups in mean pressure gradient, valve area, freedom from valve replacement, and death from cardiovascular cause. </p><p>The meta-analysis included the following randomized trials:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The SALTIRE trial enrolled 155 adults (mean age 68) with calcific AS (an aortic jet velocity of at least 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/sec,</span> mean aortic valve area of 1.03 cm<sup>2</sup>) who were randomly assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atorvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atorvastatin</a> (80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-asymptomatic-aortic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The primary end points were the nonclinical end points of change in aortic jet velocity and aortic valve calcium score.

At median follow-up of 52 months, there was no difference between groups in the primary end point (35.3 versus 38.2 percent, hazard ratio 0.96; 95% CI 0.83-1.12). The primary end point included cardiovascular death, aortic valve replacement, non-fatal myocardial infarction, hospitalized unstable angina pectoris, heart failure as a result of progression of AS, coronary artery bypass grafting, percutaneous coronary interventions, and non-hemorrhagic stroke. There was also no difference in the rate of aortic valve replacement (28 versus 30 percent) or in the rate of hemodynamic progression of AS with an increase in aortic jet velocity of 0.62&plusmn;0.61 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/s</span> per year in the placebo group compared with 0.61&plusmn;0.59 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/s</span> per year in the treatment group. Although there were fewer ischemic events in the treatment group, this difference was only due to a lower rate of coronary bypass grafting at the time of aortic valve surgery so the clinical relevance of this finding is unclear. Overall, the results of the SEAS study do not provide convincing evidence that statin therapy affects the disease process in the valve leaflets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-asymptomatic-aortic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ASTRONOMER trial enrolled a younger cohort (mean age 58) of 269 adults with mild to moderate AS (mean aortic jet velocity 3.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/s,</span> mean age 48 years old) who were randomly assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosuvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rosuvastatin</a> 40 mg daily or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-asymptomatic-aortic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Unlike earlier trials in which bicuspid aortic valve was rare (&lt;5 percent), a bicuspid valve was present in nearly half of the subjects in this study.

Approximately one-half of these patients have underlying coronary artery disease, while angina in the remaining patients is due to left ventricular hypertrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-asymptomatic-aortic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In addition, pre-existing valvular heart disease is present in approximately 5 percent of patients with an acute coronary syndrome, with approximately one-third having moderate to severe AS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-asymptomatic-aortic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Patients with pre-existing valve disease are more likely to present with heart failure and have worse outcomes than patients without valvular heart disease.</p><p>It can be difficult to determine if the symptoms are due to the valve disease or to coexisting coronary disease. There is no absolute value of AS severity that correlates with the presence of symptoms. However, angina is unlikely to be due to valve obstruction when the valve area is greater than 1.2 cm<sup>2</sup>, jet velocity is less than 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/sec,</span> and mean transvalvular gradient is less than 30 mmHg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F95630\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95630 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Among adults with any degree of AS and symptoms of angina, coronary anatomy imaging should be considered. Noninvasive imaging tests for cardiac ischemia, including stress echocardiography or stress nuclear studies, are less accurate than in patients with a normal aortic valve. If there is concern that AS might be the cause of symptoms, exercise testing is <strong>contraindicated</strong>.

Because of the noncompliant left ventricle, there is a relative shift of left ventricular filling to the later part of diastole with a greater dependence upon atrial contraction.

When anticoagulation for stroke prevention is indicated in adults with AS and atrial fibrillation, standard guidelines for anticoagulation for AF should be followed. Initially there was concern that direct oral anticoagulants were not appropriate in the presence of valve disease because patients with mitral stenosis or prosthetic heart valves were generally excluded from the major clinical trials. However, in the ARISTOTLE trial comparing the oral direct factor Xa inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apixaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">apixaban</a> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, 26 percent of the 18,201 patients had moderate or severe valve disease or previous valve surgery. There was no difference between those with and without valve disease for the effects of apixaban versus warfarin in stroke prevention or bleeding complications. Given these results, apixaban may be a reasonable alternative to warfarin in adults with AS and atrial fibrillation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/medical-management-of-asymptomatic-aortic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].
