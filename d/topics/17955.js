Malignant tumors include adenocarcinomas, carcinoids, sarcomas, and lymphomas, while benign lesions include adenomas, leiomyomas, lipomas, and hamartomas.</p><p>The treatment of the various types of neoplasms that arise in the small bowel will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of small bowel tumors are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-features-and-types-of-small-bowel-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical features, and types of small bowel neoplasms&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-staging-of-small-bowel-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and staging of small bowel neoplasms&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ADENOCARCINOMA</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Locoregional disease</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Localized adenocarcinomas of the small bowel are best managed with wide segmental surgical resection. Resection of the primary and investing mesentery achieves surgical clearance of both the primary and the regional nodes at risk for metastases, and provides important staging information that impacts decisions regarding the need for adjuvant therapy (see below). However, resection of adequate mesentery may be limited by the proximity of the nodes or tumor to the superior mesenteric artery.</p><p>Pancreaticoduodenectomy is required for tumors involving the first and second portions of the duodenum. Some surgeons promote pancreaticoduodenectomy rather than wide local excision as a superior operation for all duodenal adenocarcinomas because of its more radical clearance of the tumor bed and regional lymph nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. However, this is not necessary for the following reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unlike pancreatic cancers, which diffusely infiltrate into the surrounding soft tissues, the extension of duodenal adenocarcinomas into adjacent tissues is usually a more localized process, and tumor-free resection margins may be obtained without resection of adjacent organs and soft tissues. Because a negative margin is critical to a curative procedure, the margin status of the resected specimen must be confirmed on frozen-section and subsequent permanent histologic sections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/1,3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of retrospective studies have not shown a survival benefit for pancreaticoduodenectomy as compared with segmental resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. The largest series, from the Mayo Clinic, analyzed 68 patients with duodenal adenocarcinoma; 50 underwent radical surgery (pancreaticoduodenectomy or total pancreatectomy) while 18 had limited surgery (segmental duodenal resection or transduodenal excision) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of five-year overall survival (52 percent versus 61 percent), rate of margin-negative resections, or local recurrence rates.</p><p/><p>These observations support the view that segmental resection provides an equivalent survival benefit to that of a more extensive resection for lesions in the distal third or fourth portions of the duodenum, and satisfies the principle of en bloc resection without the morbidity of a pancreaticoduodenectomy. As long as a margin-negative resection can be obtained, segmental resection is preferred over pancreaticoduodenectomy for tumors arising in the third and fourth portions of the duodenum to the left of the superior mesenteric artery.</p><p>Adenocarcinomas involving the jejunum or proximal ileum should be treated by wide excision of the malignancy and surrounding tissues at risk for contiguous spread. A right colectomy that includes resection of the ileocolic artery and regional lymph nodes is indicated for tumors of the distal ileum.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Outcomes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At the time of diagnosis, between 65 and 76 percent of patients with a small bowel adenocarcinoma are without distant metastases and potentially resectable; approximately one-half of these have regional nodal involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. In general, five-year survival rates for small bowel adenocarcinoma are worse than for similarly staged colon cancers, particularly for node-positive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. Nodal involvement is one of the strongest predictors of long-term survival; five-year cancer-specific survival for node-positive small bowel adenocarcinoma is between 12 and 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/13,15,17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15,17-20</a>].</p><p>Five-year disease-specific survival by stage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110785\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110785 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>] for 4995 cases of small bowel adenocarcinoma reported to the National Cancer Database (NCDB) between 1985 and 1995 were as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage I &ndash; 65 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage II &ndash; 48 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage III &ndash; 35 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage IV &ndash; 4 percent</p><p/><p>However, in a Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry analysis of 1991 cases with stage I, II, or III disease from 1988 to 2005, five-year disease-specific survival was higher: stage I, 85 percent; stage II, 69 percent; and stage III, 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In addition, this analysis showed that the number of lymph nodes evaluated was a strong prognostic factor with markedly improved five-year disease-specific survival in patients with &ge;8 lymph nodes evaluated: stage I, 95 percent; stage II, 83 percent; and stage III, 56 percent. These data, in conjunction with those from two additional studies evaluating the SEER registry, suggest that a portion of stage I or II small bowel adenocarcinomas are undergoing inadequate lymph node evaluation, and consequently being understaged (and undertreated) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/20,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22,23</a>]. This appears to be particularly true for duodenal adenocarcinomas; in one study, the assessment of eight or more lymph nodes resulted in an improvement in disease-specific survival of 33 and 50 percent for patients with stage I and II disease, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Site also impacts on prognosis. Five-year disease-specific survival rates are worse for duodenal primaries than for tumors arising in the jejunum or ileum in most [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/12,13,20,22,24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13,20,22,24-26</a>] but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/11,16,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,16,27</a>] series.</p><p>Besides tumor site, and the presence of nodal and distant metastases, other poor prognostic factors include positive resection margins, lymphovascular involvement, T4 tumor stage, extent of nodal disease, and poorly differentiated histology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/3,4,11-13,17,20,25,27-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,11-13,17,20,25,27-32</a>]. Positive resection margins increase the rate of local failure, while lymph node involvement and transmural invasion of the bowel wall correlate with distant failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Adjuvant therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest adjuvant chemotherapy to patients with lymph node-positive, completely resected small bowel adenocarcinoma, in part extrapolating from published data in resected node-positive colon cancer, where routine use of adjuvant chemotherapy significantly improves survival. As with node-positive colon cancer, we suggest use of an oxaliplatin-based regimen. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Oxaliplatin</a> plus short-term infusional <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> (FU) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a> (ie, FOLFOX (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F50132\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50132 \">table 2</a>)) is a commonly chosen option, as this was the regimen shown to improve survival over FU and leucovorin alone in patients with colon cancer in the MOSAIC trial.

A 2007 Cochrane analysis concluded that there were no suitable trials to analyze [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>The rationale for use of systemic adjuvant therapy in small bowel adenocarcinoma is based upon both the known patterns of recurrence for this disease and an extrapolation from data demonstrating a significant survival benefit in patients with node-positive colon cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-stage-iii-node-positive-colon-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant therapy for resected stage III (node-positive) colon cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Among patients with completely resected small bowel adenocarcinoma, failure patterns are primarily systemic rather than local [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/10,11,31,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,31,36</a>]. In a representative series of 146 patients undergoing potentially curative resection of a small bowel adenocarcinoma, 56 relapsed at a median time of 25 months, and the patterns of relapse were distant (n = 33), peritoneal carcinomatosis (n = 11), abdominal wall (n = 4), and local recurrence (n = 10) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. One exception to this general rule is duodenal adenocarcinomas, where local failure rates as high as 41 to 50 percent are reported after surgical resection alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/9,10,19,28,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,19,28,34</a>].</p><p>There are no prospective trials testing any adjuvant therapy strategy in small bowel adenocarcinoma, and the retrospective analyses that have addressed the issue have uniformly failed to suggest any overall survival benefit from any adjuvant approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/1,10,11,16,19,27,28,34,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10,11,16,19,27,28,34,37,38</a>]. However, treatment bias may have influenced the result. in most of these reports, the patients who were chosen for adjuvant therapy were those believed to have the highest risk of recurrence (and therefore, a worse prognosis) with surgery alone.</p><p>To control for potential treatment bias, investigators conducted a propensity score-matched analysis using data on 4746 patients with resected small bowel adenocarcinoma reported to the NCDB between 1998 and 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Cox regression was used to identify the covariates of overall survival, and propensity scores were developed that accounted for all factors significantly associated with either the receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy or the survival hazard from Cox modeling. In the propensity score-matched cohort of subjects receiving adjuvant chemotherapy (n = 1142) or surgery alone (n = 1155), there was a significant survival advantage for adjuvant chemotherapy versus surgery alone (median survival 63 versus 45 months, p&lt;0.001). When stratified by pathologic stage, there was a significant survival benefit for adjuvant chemotherapy for those patients with resected stage III (node-positive) disease (median 42 versus 26 months, three-year actuarial survival 55 versus 41 percent). This benefit was observed for tumor located both in the duodenum (median overall survival 34 versus 24 months, p = 0.002) and in the <span class=\"nowrap\">jejunum/ileum</span> (median overall survival 53 versus 30 months, p = 0.003). There was only a trend toward a survival benefit for stage I and II disease, regardless of tumor location. Although suggestive of a benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, this is not a definitive study. Propensity analysis is limited by the availability of the variables upon which matching is conducted.</p><p>Despite the lack of data from randomized trials supporting a benefit from adjuvant therapy, data from a nationwide survey, registry-based series from the NCDB, and a population-based French registry series reveal an increase in the use of adjuvant chemotherapy for regionally advanced small bowel adenocarcinoma over the last 30 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/12,13,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13,39,40</a>].</p><p>As noted above, patients with duodenal cancer have a higher local failure rate after surgical resection alone. Separate reports have focused on the role of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy after complete resection of a duodenal adenocarcinoma:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective study from the Mayo Clinic included 68 patients who had curative resection of duodenal adenocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Twenty-five recurred, 21 with distant disease. Seventeen patients received adjuvant chemoradiotherapy with concurrent FU after complete resection, but there was no significant advantage in terms of survival or cancer recurrence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A similar lack of benefit for adjuvant chemoradiotherapy was noted in a multi-institutional retrospective series of 122 patients with duodenal adenocarcinoma; adjuvant chemoradiotherapy was administered to 34, and the five-year survival was no better than that of the remaining patients who did not receive it (47 versus 48 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A report from Duke University compared outcomes among 16 patients treated with surgery alone with those among 16 nonrandomly assigned patients treated with either postoperative or preoperative FU-based chemoradiotherapy (50.4 Gy) in addition to surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy did not significantly improve five-year overall survival (57 versus 44 percent, p = 0.42), although there was a trend favoring treatment in those who underwent a complete (R0) resection (five-year survival 83 versus 53 percent, p = 0.07), and local failure rates were lower (31 versus 44 percent).</p><p/><p>As with prior retrospective reports, treatment bias may have influenced these results. Furthermore, the independent contribution of RT in patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy has not been established. This issue was evaluated in a propensity score-matched analysis of 1028 patients with surgically resected duodenal adenocarcinoma who received adjuvant therapy, derived from the NCDB between 1998 and 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The addition of RT to adjuvant chemotherapy did not significantly improve survival, even in high-risk patients (ie, node-positive, T4 primary tumors, inadequate lymph node staging, poorly differentiated histology, or margin-positive resections).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Neoadjuvant therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy has only been studied in a very small number of patients, this approach is promising [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/28,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,41,42</a>]. In the largest report of 32 patients with localized duodenal adenocarcinoma, 2 of 11 patients treated with preoperative RT and concurrent FU-based chemotherapy had a pathologic complete response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Several steps are required for the immune system to effectively attack tumor cells. These include tumor recognition, presentation of tumor antigen to T cells, T cell activation, and direct attack of tumor. Several immune checkpoints exist to dampen the immune response in order to protect against detrimental inflammation and autoimmunity. In the setting of malignancy, such immune checkpoints can lead to immune tolerance of the tumor and subsequent progression of malignancy. One well-characterized checkpoint being targeted in several tumor types is PD-1. PD-1 is upregulated on activated T cells, and upon recognition of tumor via the T cell receptor, PD-1 engagement by programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) can lead to T cell inactivation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F90346\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90346 \">figure 1</a>).

In an asymptomatic patient, if there are no contraindications to surgery, and the metastases appear resectable, then an attempt at complete extirpation is usually undertaken. Resection of hepatic metastases prolongs disease-free survival, and it may possibly increase overall survival as well.

Symptomatic relief may be obtained by debulking surgery; however, the duration of effective relief from these palliative procedures can be short, usually less than 12 months. On the other hand, treatment with somatostatin analogs usually provides longer-term adequate symptomatic relief.

However, prophylactic surgery is usually not undertaken unless surgery is being performed for another reason, or if serial computed tomography (CT) scans demonstrate the development of fibrosing mesenteritis.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peutz-jeghers-syndrome-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peutz-Jeghers syndrome: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although rare overall, a variety of malignant and benign neoplasms arise within the small intestine. Malignant tumors include adenocarcinomas, carcinoids, stromal tumors (gastrointestinal stromal tumors [GISTs] and non-GIST soft tissue sarcomas), and lymphomas. The most common benign lesions arising in the small bowel are adenomas, leiomyomas, and lipomas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-features-and-types-of-small-bowel-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical features, and types of small bowel neoplasms&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of a small bowel tumor is often made late in the course of the disease because these are generally rare conditions and the symptoms are nonspecific (abdominal pain, weight loss, nausea and vomiting, occult gastrointestinal tract bleeding). Early diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-features-and-types-of-small-bowel-neoplasms#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical features, and types of small bowel neoplasms&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Issues relevant to diagnosis and staging of small bowel neoplasms are presented elsewhere. The following represent our recommendations for treatment of each tumor type. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-staging-of-small-bowel-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and staging of small bowel neoplasms&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h2\">Adenocarcinoma</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For localized adenocarcinomas of the first and second portion of the duodenum, we recommend pancreaticoduodenectomy rather than segmental resection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). We suggest segmental resection rather than pancreaticoduodenectomy for lesions in the third and fourth portion of the duodenum, as long as negative resection margins can be achieved (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For localized tumors of the jejunum and proximal ileum, we recommend wide excision of the malignancy and surrounding tissues at risk for contiguous spread (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). For tumors of the distal ileum, we recommend right colectomy rather than segmental resection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Locoregional disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest a course of postoperative oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy rather than surgery alone for patients with lymph node-positive resected small bowel adenocarcinoma (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Oxaliplatin</a> plus short-term infusional <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> (FU) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a> (ie, FOLFOX (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F50132\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50132 \">table 2</a>)) is a commonly chosen option, as this was the regimen shown to improve survival over FU and leucovorin alone in patients with colon cancer in the MOSAIC trial. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-stage-iii-node-positive-colon-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant therapy for resected stage III (node-positive) colon cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, based upon the substantial activity of the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capecitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capecitabine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a> in the metastatic setting (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F96117\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96117 \">table 5</a>), we generally prefer this combination for adjuvant chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-small-bowel-neoplasms/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with node-positive duodenal primaries, we suggest fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiotherapy in addition to adjuvant oxaliplatin-containing systemic chemotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For other patients at high risk for a local recurrence (incompletely resected, T4 primary), we also suggest chemoradiotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The role of neoadjuvant therapy is undefined. We consider this approach on a case-by-case basis in patients with bulky or locally advanced disease. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Neoadjuvant therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic disease who are able to tolerate it, we suggest systemic chemotherapy rather than supportive care alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We use an oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy regimen, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capecitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capecitabine</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a> (CAPOX (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F61781\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61781 \">table 3</a>)) or modified short-term infusional <span class=\"nowrap\">FU/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=leucovorin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leucovorin</a></span> plus oxaliplatin (eg, mFOLFOX6 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F50132\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50132 \">table 2</a>)), as a first-line regimen. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Another option for treatment at progression for patients who have advanced tumors with deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) or high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI-H) is immunotherapy with an immune checkpoint inhibitor that targets the programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1; ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pembrolizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pembrolizumab</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4101885089\" class=\"local\">'Immunotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatic resection is a reasonable option for selected patients with potentially resectable liver metastases, a controlled primary site, and no extrahepatic metastases. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Metastasectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h2\">Sarcoma</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend en bloc segmental resection with tumor-free margins rather than peritumoral resection as the primary treatment modality for most resectable GISTs and other primary sarcomas of the small bowel (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). We suggest initial <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> rather than upfront surgery for a borderline resectable or unresectable but nonmetastatic small bowel GIST tumor (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Sarcoma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risks, benefits, and recommendations regarding the use of adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> following complete resection of a GIST are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-imatinib-for-gastrointestinal-stromal-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant and neoadjuvant imatinib for gastrointestinal stromal tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h2\">Carcinoid</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend wide en bloc segmental resection that includes the adjacent mesentery and lymph nodes for small bowel carcinoid tumors of any size rather than local excision alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since approximately 40 percent of patients with midgut carcinoids have a second gastrointestinal tract malignancy, the entire bowel and colon should be evaluated prior to and during any surgical intervention. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of localized disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29690861\"><span class=\"h2\">Lymphoma</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, the treatment approach for extranodal involvement of the intestinal tract by a lymphoma generally parallels the treatment approach for that histological subtype of lymphoma arising in nodal regions. For patients who undergo surgical resection of localized stage IE or IIE disease for diagnostic purposes or because of the presence of obstruction or perforation, we recommend the addition of chemotherapy rather than surgery alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-extranodal-marginal-zone-lymphoma-of-mucosa-associated-lymphoid-tissue-malt-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of extranodal marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT lymphoma)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36\"><span class=\"h2\">Benign lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Management of benign small bowel lesions must be tailored to their size, number, location, malignant potential, and whether they are symptomatic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37\"><span class=\"h3\">Adenomas</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For simple tubular adenomas, Brunner gland adenomas, and villous adenomas with no evidence of in situ or invasive malignancy, we recommend endoscopic polypectomy, simple local resection, or submucosal resection rather than more radical resection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). We recommend radical resection for villous adenomas containing areas of malignant growth (in situ or invasive) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Adenoma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recommendations regarding management of duodenal adenomas in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) are provided elsewhere.
