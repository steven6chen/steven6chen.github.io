Determining the underlying cause of an irregular rhythm is important, as it may be a life-threatening or serious condition. In the majority of children, the cause of an irregular heart rate is identified by an in-depth history and physical examination, and electrocardiogram, which can be completed by the primary clinician. In some cases, referral to a pediatric cardiologist is required for further diagnostic work-up and, if necessary, treatment.</p><p>The etiology and evaluation of an irregular heart rhythm in children will be reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most likely diagnosis for an irregular heart rate varies with the clinical setting in which the irregularity is first noted. The differential diagnosis and subsequent evaluation differs for an asymptomatic child with an incidental finding of an irregular heart rate compared with a symptomatic child who complains of palpitations or who has an episode of syncope. In general, the asymptomatic child will have a benign condition, whereas the symptomatic child is more likely to have a significant arrhythmia that may require intervention.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Asymptomatic child</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following are the most common causes of an irregular rhythm in an asymptomatic child, which is usually detected as an incidental finding during a routine physical examination or evaluation for some other issue.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sinus arrhythmia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ventricular premature beats (VPBs)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrial premature beats (APBs)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Sinus arrhythmia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sinus arrhythmia is a normal physiologic variant that is characterized by an increased heart rate during inspiration and a decreased heart rate during expiration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78161\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef78161 \">waveform 1</a>). Rhythm variability is caused, in part, by changes in parasympathetic input to the heart, which is mediated by the vagus nerve. Vagal tone, in turn, is modulated by the respiratory cycle. During expiration, enhanced vagal tone lowers the heart rate, and during inspiration, vagal withdrawal increases the heart rate. During active exercise, vagal tone is decreased and the sympathetic tone is increased, which results in an increased heart rate and abolishment of at rest sinus arrhythmia.</p><p>Sinus arrhythmia is a benign condition, even in individuals (eg, physically trained athletes) in whom this <span class=\"nowrap\">vagal/respiratory</span> heart rate pattern is markedly pronounced. The diagnosis is made by electrocardiogram. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Electrocardiogram'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Ventricular premature beats</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>VPBs, also referred to as premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), are premature depolarizations of the ventricles leading to early systolic contraction of the ventricles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57511\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef57511 \">waveform 2</a>). VPBs are usually followed by a pause and occur without regularity, resulting in an irregular heart rate. VPBs also may on occasion occur in an irregular pattern (eg, every other beat: bigeminy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F51529\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef51529 \">waveform 3</a>), or every third beat: trigeminy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64181\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef64181 \">waveform 4</a>)).</p><p>In an asymptomatic healthy child, VPBs that occur in isolation are generally benign and produce few or no symptoms. VPBs commonly occur in infancy, decline in incidence in early childhood, and become increasingly common again in adolescence and adulthood.</p><p>VPBs rarely cause true hemodynamic compromise except in patients with frequent VPBs and severely depressed left ventricular function, or when they are concurrent with bradycardia. In these patients, VPBs may be associated with an increased risk of a malignant arrhythmia, such as sustained ventricular tachycardia. Frequent or polymorphic VPBs also may be a harbinger of a more malignant arrhythmia, such as catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardia-in-children#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of wide QRS complex tachycardia in children&quot;, section on 'Ventricular tachycardia'</a>.)</p><p>The clinical significance and evaluation of VPBs are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ventricular-premature-beats\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ventricular premature beats&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Atrial premature beats</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>APBs, also known as premature atrial contractions (PACs), are early depolarizations of atrial myocardium that lead to propagation of electrical impulses through the atrium and to the ventricle via the atrioventricular (AV) node. These electrical impulses result in early systolic ventricular contraction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F66489\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef66489 \">waveform 5</a>). Although APBs occur most commonly in isolation in infants and young children, they can occur throughout childhood. In asymptomatic children, APBs are benign and are unlikely to be associated with sustained tachyarrhythmias. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=supraventricular-premature-beats\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Supraventricular premature beats&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptomatic child</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a symptomatic child with an irregular heart rate, there is an increased likelihood that the underlying etiology is due to a sustained tachyarrhythmia. These tachyarrhythmias may be paroxysmal in nature, and often present with episodes of palpitations, syncope, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chest pain. They include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Focal and multifocal atrial tachycardia</strong> &minus; Focal atrial tachycardia (FAT), also referred to as ectopic atrial tachycardia, is caused by rapid depolarizations from a single atrial focus outside the sinoatrial node (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70215\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef70215 \">waveform 6</a>). Clinical presentation varies from mild symptoms of palpitations and dizziness associated with sporadic episodes of tachycardia to heart failure with prolonged episodes of sustained tachycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/irregular-heart-rate-arrhythmias-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. FAT is an uncommon condition that is seen more frequently in infants and young children in whom spontaneous resolution is likely. In contrast, FAT in children beyond three years of age is likely to be a chronic condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/irregular-heart-rate-arrhythmias-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Multifocal atrial tachycardia is a rare disorder that is caused by multiple foci of enhanced atrial automaticity, which presents in a similar manner to FAT. The variability of the timing in the firing of these foci, as well as the variability in conduction through the AV node during these arrhythmias account for the irregular heart rate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=focal-atrial-tachycardia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Focal atrial tachycardia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=multifocal-atrial-tachycardia#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Multifocal atrial tachycardia&quot;, section on 'MAT in children and young adults'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Reentrant supraventricular tachycardia</strong> &minus; In reentrant supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), an electrical impulse cycles repetitively through a circuit from the atria to the ventricles and back again, which results in rapid, regular ventricular contractions. Common clinical manifestations of reentrant SVT are palpitations, chest pain, fatigue, and lightheadedness (due to the hypotension associated with the rapid heart rate). Most children tolerate short episodes of tachycardia well. Although prolonged episodes can precipitate heart failure, this is uncommon because other symptoms (eg, palpitations) prompt patients to seek medical attention before this occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/irregular-heart-rate-arrhythmias-in-children/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Certain forms of SVT, such as atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia, may be associated with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76226\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef76226 \">waveform 7</a>). WPW syndrome is associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. These patients are referred to a pediatric cardiologist for further diagnostic evaluation and management. Two forms of reentrant SVT, AVRT including the WPW syndrome and atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-supraventricular-tachycardia-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of supraventricular tachycardia in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Atrial fibrillation</strong> &ndash; Atrial fibrillation is a relatively unusual finding in childhood, characterized by an irregularly irregular rhythm originating in the atrium and conducting to the ventricle at varying rates, dependent upon variability in conduction through the AV node (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F62698\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef62698 \">waveform 8</a>). Patients with atrial fibrillation may be asymptomatic or present with symptoms such as palpitations and dizziness. If episodes are prolonged and the ventricular rate is elevated, patients may develop congestive heart failure. Episodes of atrial fibrillation are associated with the risk of stroke. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-tachycardias-in-children#H5913198\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial tachycardias in children&quot;, section on 'Atrial fibrillation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ventricular tachycardia</strong> &minus; In children with normal hearts, ventricular tachycardia (VT) is relatively uncommon and is usually benign. Common forms of pediatric VT include right ventricular outflow tract tachycardia and posterior fascicular ventricular tachycardia arising from the left ventricle. Common clinical manifestations include palpitations and syncope, although some children may be asymptomatic and present because of an incidental finding on routine physical examination. In children with congenital and acquired heart disease, the risk of VT increases, and there is a high risk of mortality and serious morbidity. Causes, evaluation, and management of ventricular tachycardia in children are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardia-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of wide QRS complex tachycardia in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-evaluation-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardia-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and evaluation of wide QRS complex tachycardia in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Bradycardia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children who have bradycardia and an irregular heart rate may be asymptomatic and present because of an incidental finding on routine physical examination, or present with symptoms such as fatigue, dizziness, and syncope. The causes of bradycardia and an irregular heart rate include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sinus node dysfunction &minus; In sinus node dysfunction, there is inappropriate sinus bradycardia or chronotropic incompetence (failure to appropriately elevate the heart rate in response to physiologic stress). This results in a slow heart rate and potential irregularity because of variations in the length of pauses in sinus activation and compensatory escape beats arising from other parts of the atrium, AV node, or ventricle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Sinus node dysfunction is uncommon in patients with structurally normal hearts. In contrast, it is a common complication in patients with complex congenital heart disease (CHD), and it can be associated with inflammatory diseases such as myocarditis, Kawasaki disease, or rheumatic heart disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Second-degree heart block &minus; Children who have second degree AV block, in whom the organized atrial impulse fails to be conducted to the ventricle in a 1:1 ratio, may have a regularly irregular or irregularly irregular slow heart rate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients with Mobitz type 1 block (also referred to as Wenckebach block), the PR interval progressively lengthens until a sinus beat is not conducted through the AV node in a consistent pattern of timing, resulting in a regularly irregular heart rate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73051\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef73051 \">waveform 9</a>). These patients are generally asymptomatic, and treatment is generally not indicated unless there is evidence for more significant conduction system dysfunction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients with Mobitz type 2 block, a P wave suddenly fails to conduct without any change in PR interval. This rhythm may be a regularly irregular or irregularly irregular heart rate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79539\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef79539 \">waveform 10</a>). This condition may progress to complete heart block and is sometimes associated with CHD.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial evaluation begins with a comprehensive history and physical examination regardless of the setting in which the irregular heart rate is first noted. The cause of an irregular heart rate is often diagnosed by an electrocardiogram (ECG), which should be obtained if the history and physical examination have not completely confirmed that the irregularity is due to a benign etiology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71674\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef71674 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history should focus on determining whether there are other signs of heart disease, and begins to differentiate among the various causes of an irregular heart rate. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p>Important elements of the history include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/irregular-heart-rate-arrhythmias-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpitations &minus; The presence of palpitations (awareness of the beating of the heart) may represent an abnormality in heart rate or rhythm. Palpitations can be manifestations of a single beat (eg, ventricular premature beats [VPBs]), nonsustained tachycardias, or a sustained tachycardia. An accurate description may be useful in identifying the underlying arrhythmia. For example, palpitations due to sinus tachycardia usually have a gradual onset and termination, and are associated with anxiety or activity. In contrast, patients with reentrant tachyarrhythmia typically have a sudden onset and ending of palpitations that correlate with the opening and closing of the circuit responsible for the arrhythmia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Syncope &minus; Although the range of causes of syncope (defined as sudden, brief loss of consciousness associated with loss of postural tone from which recovery is spontaneous) is broad (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60014\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60014 \">table 1</a>), a history of syncope increases the risk for an underlying serious cardiac disease and the potential for a life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia. As a result, an ECG is recommended as part of the initial evaluation for any child with a syncopal episode (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F53383\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef53383 \">algorithm 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-syncope-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of syncope in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-evaluation-of-syncope-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency evaluation of syncope in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain &minus; Cardiac arrhythmias with an irregular heart rate are rare cases of chest pain in children, which include supraventricular tachycardia with or without underlying Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome VPBs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-nontraumatic-chest-pain-in-children-and-adolescents#H876681632\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of nontraumatic chest pain in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Cardiac disease'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family history &minus; Familial sudden unexpected death has been associated with WPW syndrome, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, which may be preceded by frequent spontaneous premature beats. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sudden-cardiac-arrest-in-the-absence-of-apparent-structural-heart-disease#H599199\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sudden cardiac arrest in the absence of apparent structural heart disease&quot;, section on 'Familial SCD'</a>.)</p><p/><p>If any of these historical elements is suggestive of an underlying cardiac disorder, an ECG should be obtained as an initial part of the evaluation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical examination should include a complete description of the irregular heart rate, because several conditions have characteristic findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Respiratory cycle</strong> &minus; Any consistent change of the heart rate in relation to the respiratory cycle should be noted. It is helpful in a cooperative child to have the patient take large inspiration and hold it prior to exhaling while the rhythm is being assessed. Patients with sinus arrhythmia have a characteristic increased heart rate during inspiration that decreases with expiration. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Sinus arrhythmia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Isolated ectopy</strong> &minus; An irregular early heart beat followed by a pause in the midst of an otherwise regular rhythm is suggestive of VPBs or atrial premature beats (APBs). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Ventricular premature beats'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Atrial premature beats'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bradycardia</strong> &minus; In patients with bradycardia and an irregularly regular rhythm, an irregular heart beat that arises from a pause in an otherwise regular rhythm is suggestive of sinus node dysfunction or second degree atrioventricular (AV) block. Patients with irregularly irregular bradycardia may have Mobitz type 2 AV block. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Bradycardia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tachycardia &minus; Several tachyarrhythmias may be associated with an irregular heart rate, especially in a symptomatic child, including focal and multifocal atrial tachycardia, reentrant supraventricular tachycardia, and ventricular tachycardia. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic child'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>Other elements of the cardiac examination include inspection, palpation (apical impulse, heave, thrill), and auscultation of the heart to assess the heart sounds and detect the presence of a gallop or murmur. Any abnormality of the cardiac examination increases the likelihood of a significant cardiac disorder, and an ECG should be obtained as an initial part of the evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-infant-or-child-with-a-cardiac-murmur#H14181578\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the infant or child with a cardiac murmur&quot;, section on 'Cardiovascular examination'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-infant-or-child-with-a-cardiac-murmur#H14181621\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the infant or child with a cardiac murmur&quot;, section on 'Auscultation of heart sounds and murmurs'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrocardiogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the history and physical examination have not confirmed that the irregularity is due to a benign etiology, the next step in the evaluation is the performance of an ECG.

During the ECG, the child can be asked to hold <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> breath during inspiration, which is correlated with an increase in heart rate. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Sinus arrhythmia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VPBs and APBs may be found during a rhythm strip depending upon their frequency (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57511\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef57511 \">waveform 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F51529\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef51529 \">waveform 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64181\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef64181 \">waveform 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F66489\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef66489 \">waveform 5</a>).

In particular, transtelephonic monitoring is most useful in trying to determine whether SVT or VT is present or not. Transtelephonic monitor provides a rhythm recording, which can either be stored or transmitted by telephone to a healthcare provider. There are two basic types of transtelephonic monitors.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Activation by the patient &minus; The event monitor is activated by the patient at the onset of symptoms. The most common monitors are relatively small hand-held devices with electrodes that can record rhythm strips after an activation button is pressed.

Smartphone applications can be used by patients to record their rhythms, which are then stored on the smart phone and can later be transmitted to caregivers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continuous monitor &ndash; Loop monitors continuously monitor the rhythm. At activation, the preactivation rhythm of 5 to 10 seconds is also captured. These monitors can be set up to record automatically based on a preset heart rate criteria, so that they may be used to capture asymptomatic events or events that occur in young children who are not capable of activating the monitor.</p><p/><p>One major impediment to these devices is that it may be difficult for a child to wear the leads for an extended period of time, as the prolonged application of the leads can cause skin irritation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Exercise testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of exercise testing is to observe the effect of enhanced sympathetic drive upon the rhythm status in a child found to have an ECG or Holter monitor abnormality. It permits an assessment of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sinus node function</strong> &minus; Exercise testing evaluates the ability of the sinus node to respond to stress by comparing the heart rate with normative data. Patients with sinus node dysfunction have chronotropic incompetence (failure to appropriately elevate the heart rate in response to physiologic stress). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Bradycardia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intracardiac conduction</strong> &minus; For patients with AV block, exercise may demonstrate changes in conduction pattern, escape rates, or the development of ventricular ectopy. Results from exercise testing may assist in determining whether pacemaker placement is indicated. AV conduction that improves with exercise in patients is a reassuring sign.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome</strong> &minus; The sudden disappearance of the delta wave during exercise suggests that these patients are at low risk for sudden death. These results indicate that the accessory pathway is not rapidly conducted from the atrium to the ventricle so that the resulting heart rate during an atrial arrhythmia would not be excessively fast and irregular. In contrast, patients in whom the ECG findings of WPW syndrome persist during exercise may still be at risk for sudden death and require further assessment with electrophysiology study (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71674\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef71674 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Electrophysiology study'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>VPBs and risk of VT</strong> &minus; An exercise test is performed to help determine if patients with frequent isolated VPBs are at risk for developing more complex and potentially dangerous VT. If, during exercise, ventricular ectopy is suppressed, the VPBs are determined to be benign. However, if ventricular ectopy worsens and the patient develops nonsustained or sustained VT, further invasive evaluation and management (ie, electrophysiology study [EPS]) is required. If VPBs remain and there is no complex ectopy, the result of the exercise testing is equivocal. An equivocal exercise test does not help in the clinical evaluation of the patient, so the decision to proceed with further testing should be based upon the patient's history, physical, and other testing results.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Echocardiogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The echocardiogram is performed when there is an increased likelihood for structural heart disease as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suspicion of structural heart disease based upon clinical findings other than the irregular heart rate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sinus node dysfunction, because this condition is uncommon in patients who have a structurally normal heart.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AV block from acquired inflammatory diseases (eg, Lyme Disease or autoimmune diseases contracted later in life) because there may be valvar or pericardial injury.

In general, an asymptomatic child with an incidental finding of an irregular heart rate will have a benign condition, whereas a symptomatic child (palpitations, syncope, or chest pain) is more likely to have a significant arrhythmia that may require intervention. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determining the underlying cause of an irregular rhythm is important, as it may be a life-threatening or serious condition. In the majority of children, the cause of an irregular heart rate is identified by an in-depth history and physical examination, and electrocardiography (ECG), which can be completed by the primary care clinician (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71674\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef71674 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Initial evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A referral to a pediatric cardiologist is made when the initial evaluation does not result in a diagnosis, the patient is symptomatic, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the ECG demonstrates a significant abnormality. Further testing is dependent upon the findings of the preceding evaluation, the setting in which the irregularity is first noted, and, if present, the frequency and duration of symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71674\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef71674 \">algorithm 1</a>). Testing includes Holter monitoring, event monitoring, exercise testing, echocardiogram, and electrophysiology study. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Cardiac referral and further evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of irregular heart rate depends upon multiple factors, including the cause of the irregularity and whether it poses significant risk to the patient, the severity and frequency of associated symptoms, whether the arrhythmia is amenable to medical therapy, and the family's preference regarding treatment options (medical therapy versus catheter ablation).
