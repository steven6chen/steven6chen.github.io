During the acute phase, manifestations range from subclinical or anicteric hepatitis to icteric hepatitis and, in some cases, fulminant hepatitis; during the chronic phase, manifestations range from an asymptomatic carrier state to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Extrahepatic manifestations can also occur with both acute and chronic infection.</p><p>The clinical manifestations and natural history of HBV infection will be reviewed here. Issues related to epidemiology, transmission, and treatment are discussed separately (see appropriate topic reviews). Terms used to define different clinical states are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F81182\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81182 \">table 1</a>). These terms will be used throughout the discussion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ACUTE HEPATITIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1579639390\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 70 percent of patients with acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection have subclinical or anicteric hepatitis, while 30 percent develop icteric hepatitis. The disease may be more severe in patients coinfected with other hepatitis viruses or with underlying liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Fulminant hepatic failure is unusual, occurring in approximately 0.1 to 0.5 percent of patients. Fulminant hepatitis B is believed to be due to massive immune-mediated lysis of infected hepatocytes. This explains why many patients with fulminant hepatitis B have no evidence of HBV replication at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The reasons why HBV has a fulminant course in some patients are not well-understood. A case-control study evaluated risk factors for a fulminant course in an outbreak among injection drug users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Compared with control patients, case patients were more likely to have used <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> during their illness (p = 0.08), used more alcohol and methamphetamine, and lost more weight in the six months before illness. Furthermore, all nine isolates were genotype D (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-significance-of-hepatitis-b-virus-genotypes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical significance of hepatitis B virus genotypes&quot;</a>). It is unclear whether viral or environmental factors led to the fulminant course in this outbreak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], or if the risk factors identified in this outbreak can be generalized to acute HBV in other settings.</p><p>The method of acquiring HBV infection varies geographically. Perinatal transmission and occasionally horizontal transmission early in life are most common in high prevalence areas such as southeast Asia and China, while sexual contact and percutaneous transmission (eg, intravenous drug use) are most common in the United States, Canada, and western Europe (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F81182\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81182 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, transmission, and prevention of hepatitis B virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The incubation period lasts one to four months. A serum sickness-like syndrome may develop during the prodromal period, followed by constitutional symptoms, anorexia, nausea, jaundice, and right upper quadrant discomfort. The symptoms and jaundice generally disappear after one to three months, but some patients have prolonged fatigue even after normalization of serum aminotransferase concentrations.</p><p>Laboratory testing during the acute phase reveals elevations in the concentration of alanine and aspartate aminotransferase levels (ALT and AST); values up to 1000 to 2000 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span> are typically seen during the acute phase with ALT being higher than AST. The serum bilirubin concentration may be normal in patients with anicteric hepatitis. The prothrombin time is the best indicator of prognosis. In patients who recover, the normalization of serum aminotransferases usually occurs within one to four months. A persistent elevation of serum ALT for more than six months indicates a progression to chronic hepatitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Outcome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among patients who recover from acute hepatitis B, traces of HBV are often detectable in the blood by polymerase chain reaction testing for many years, despite the presence of serum antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) and HBV-specific cytotoxic T cells, which can be present at high levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. HBV-specific cytotoxic T cells may express activation markers, indicating recent contact with antigen in patients studied up to 23 years after clinical and serologic recovery. One study found that HBV DNA was detected in the liver tissues in 13 of 14 healthy liver transplant donors who were positive for hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) and anti-HBs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Persistent histologic abnormalities (including fibrosis and mild inflammation) were present for as long as 10 years in another series focusing on nine patients who demonstrated a complete serologic recovery after acute infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>These observations suggest that complete eradication of HBV rarely occurs after recovery from acute HBV infection and that latent infection can maintain the T cell response for decades following clinical recovery, thereby keeping the virus under control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Although some studies suggest that liver damage may be present in patients with latent infection, it is not clear how common this is since these studies were based on very few patients. However, immunosuppression in such patients can lead to reactivation of the virus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-reactivation-associated-with-immunosuppressive-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus reactivation associated with immunosuppressive therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The rate of progression from acute to chronic hepatitis B in immunocompetent persons is determined primarily by the age at infection. The rate is approximately 90 percent for a perinatally acquired infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], 20 to 50 percent for infections between the age of one and five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>], and less than 5 percent for an adult-acquired infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The factors responsible for the high rate of progression in neonates and children are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Phases of chronic HBV infection'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment for acute HBV is mainly supportive. In addition, appropriate measures should be taken to prevent infection in exposed contacts.</p><p>The decision to hospitalize patients should be individualized. Patients who have a coagulopathy, are deeply jaundiced, or are encephalopathic should generally be hospitalized. Hospitalization might also be considered in patients who are older, have significant comorbidities, cannot tolerate oral intake, or have poor social support systems.</p><p>Whether patients should be treated with nucleos(t)ide therapy is unsettled since few studies have addressed the benefits of antiviral therapy during acute infection. We do not believe that all patients with acute HBV require antiviral treatment since the likelihood of fulminant hepatitis B is less than 1 percent, and in immunocompetent adults, the likelihood of progression to chronic HBV infection is less than 5 percent.</p><p>This recommendation was supported by a placebo-controlled study that included 71 patients with acute hepatitis B (31 randomized to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a> for three months and 40 to placebo), which showed no biochemical or clinical benefit to lamivudine, including the subset of 47 patients with severe acute hepatitis B [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. There was also no difference in HBsAg loss after 12 months (94 versus 97 percent in the groups that received lamivudine and placebo, respectively). These data support that antiviral therapy is not indicated in the vast majority of patients with acute hepatitis B, but the role of antiviral therapy in patients with severe or protracted acute hepatitis B was not adequately addressed as the duration of illness was not mentioned, and only 3 of the 47 patients with severe acute hepatitis had encephalopathy.</p><p>As a general rule, we treat patients with a severe (such as those who develop a coagulopathy [INR &gt;1.5]) or a protracted course (such as persistent symptoms or marked jaundice [bilirubin &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL]</span> for more than four weeks after presentation). We also suggest treating patients with fulminant hepatitis B to reduce the likelihood of reinfection post-liver transplant, those who are immunocompromised, have a concomitant infection with hepatitis C or D virus, have a preexisting liver disease, or are elderly.</p><p>Interferon should be avoided because of the increased risk of hepatic necroinflammation. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=entecavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Entecavir</a>, tenofovir, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lamivudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lamivudine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adefovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adefovir</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=telbivudine-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">telbivudine</a> are acceptable options given as monotherapy as the duration of treatment should be short. However, in situations in which it is unclear if the patient has acute HBV or an acute exacerbation of chronic HBV, entecavir or tenofovir (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tenofovir disoproxil fumarate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenofovir-alafenamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tenofovir alafenamide</a>) is preferred since these agents have a higher barrier to resistance. Treatment can be stopped after confirmation (two consecutive tests four weeks apart) that the patient has cleared HBsAg. More detailed information about these agents is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-overview-of-management#H2130204242\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus: Overview of management&quot;, section on 'Overview of antiviral agents'</a>.) </p><p>Issues related to preventing HBV infection in individuals exposed to the patient are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-transmission-and-prevention-of-hepatitis-b-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, transmission, and prevention of hepatitis B virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CHRONIC HEPATITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A history of acute hepatitis is elicited in only a small percentage of patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. In low or intermediate prevalence areas, approximately 30 to 50 percent of patients with chronic HBV infection have a past history of acute hepatitis; such a history is lacking in the remaining patients in these areas and in the majority of patients in high prevalence areas (predominantly perinatal infection).</p><p>Many patients with chronic HBV are asymptomatic (unless they have decompensated cirrhosis or have extrahepatic manifestations), while others have nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue. Some patients experience exacerbations of the infection which may be asymptomatic, mimic acute hepatitis, or manifest as hepatic failure.</p><p>Physical examination may be normal, or there may be stigmata of chronic liver disease. Jaundice, splenomegaly, ascites, peripheral edema, and encephalopathy may be present in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Laboratory tests may be normal, but most patients have a mild to moderate elevation in serum AST and ALT. During exacerbations, the serum ALT concentration may be as high as 50 times the upper limit of normal, and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) concentrations as high as 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> may be seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A progression to cirrhosis is suspected when there is evidence of hypersplenism (decreased white blood cell and platelet counts) or impaired hepatic synthetic function (hypoalbuminemia, prolonged prothrombin time, hyperbilirubinemia).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Extrahepatic manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extrahepatic manifestations, which are thought to be mediated by circulating immune complexes, occur in 10 to 20 percent of patients with chronic HBV infection. As mentioned above, acute hepatitis may be heralded by a serum sickness-like syndrome manifested as fever, skin rashes, arthralgia, and arthritis, which usually subsides with the onset of jaundice. The two major extrahepatic complications of chronic HBV are polyarteritis nodosa and glomerular disease.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variable proportion of patients with polyarteritis nodosa are HBsAg positive. The clinical manifestations are similar to those in patients with polyarteritis who are HBV-negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Patients with HBV-related polyarteritis may benefit from antiviral therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polyarteritis-nodosa-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-disease-associated-with-hepatitis-b-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal disease associated with hepatitis B virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HBV can induce both membranous nephropathy and, less often, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. Most cases of HBV-related glomerulonephropathy occur in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. The typical presentation is with nephrotic range proteinuria. Approximately 30 to 60 percent of children with HBV-related membranous nephropathy undergo spontaneous remission, usually in association with hepatitis B e antigen to antibody (HBeAg to anti-HBe) seroconversion. A progression to renal failure can occur, particularly in adults. The efficacy of antiviral therapy is uncertain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-disease-associated-with-hepatitis-b-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal disease associated with hepatitis B virus infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aplastic anemia has been described in association with HBV infection, although most cases of post-hepatitis aplastic anemia are not due to HBV. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-aplastic-anemia-in-children-and-adolescents#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired aplastic anemia in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Hepatitis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PHASES OF CHRONIC HBV INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The natural course of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is determined by the interplay between virus replication and the host immune response. Other factors that may play a role in the progression of HBV-related liver disease include gender, alcohol consumption, and concomitant infection with other hepatitis virus(es). The outcome of chronic HBV infection depends upon the severity of liver disease at the time HBV replication is arrested.</p><p>Chronic HBV infection generally consists of two phases: an early replicative phase with active liver disease (immune-active chronic HBV), and a later phase with low replication and remission of liver disease (inactive chronic HBV) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F67609\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67609 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. In patients with a perinatally acquired HBV infection, there is an additional immune tolerance phase in which virus replication is not accompanied by active liver disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F76907\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76907 \">figure 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In some patients, reactivation of HBV replication occurs after a varying period of quiescence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Immune tolerance (replicative phase)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with a perinatally acquired HBV infection, the initial phase is characterized by high levels of HBV replication&mdash;the presence of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and high levels of HBV DNA in serum&mdash;but no evidence of active liver disease as manifested by lack of symptoms, normal serum ALT concentrations, and minimal changes on liver biopsy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F76907\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76907 \">figure 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Two studies found that 30 to 50 percent of patients in this phase had stage 0 while the others had stage I fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. One of these studies showed that fibrosis scores on repeat biopsies were unchanged after five years among patients who remained in the immune tolerance phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>The lack of liver disease despite high levels of HBV replication has typically been attributed to immune tolerance to HBV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Experiments in mice suggest that the transplacental transfer of maternal HBeAg may induce specific unresponsiveness of T cells to HBeAg and to HBcAg, resulting in ineffective cytotoxic T cell lysis of infected hepatocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Immune tolerance is also believed to be the major reason for the poor response to interferon therapy in HBeAg positive Asian patients who have normal serum ALT concentrations. However, subsequent studies have found that the T cell response to HBV in patients during this phase is similar to those in the immune clearance phase, challenging the concept of immune tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>The immune tolerance phase usually lasts 10 to 30 years, during which there is a very low rate of spontaneous HBeAg clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Studies in Chinese children, for example, have found HBeAg in as many as 90 percent below the age of five, and up to 80 percent below the age of 20 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/23,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,29</a>]. The cumulative rate of spontaneous HBeAg clearance is estimated to be approximately 2 percent during the first three years and only 15 percent after 20 years of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. The low rate of viral clearance in adolescence and early adulthood accounts for the high frequency of maternal-infant transmission in Asian countries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Immune-active, HBeAg-positive (replicative phase)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The transition from the immune tolerance to the immune-active or clearance phase occurs during the second and third decades in patients with perinatally acquired HBV infection. During this phase, spontaneous HBeAg clearance increases to an annual rate of 10 to 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. A seroconversion rate of 70 percent during 10 years of follow-up was described in a population-based study of 1536 Alaskan natives who acquired HBV as adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Several studies from Asia found that patients with genotype B infection undergo HBeAg seroconversion at an earlier age than those with genotype C infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-significance-of-hepatitis-b-virus-genotypes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical significance of hepatitis B virus genotypes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>HBeAg seroconversion is frequently, but not always, accompanied by biochemical exacerbations (abrupt increases in serum ALT) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F76907\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76907 \">figure 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/14,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,33,34</a>]. Exacerbations are believed to be due to a sudden increase in immune-mediated lysis of infected hepatocytes. They are often preceded by an increase in serum HBV DNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>] and a shift of HBcAg (hepatitis B core antigen) from nuclear to cytoplasmic sites within hepatocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], suggesting that immune clearance may be triggered by an increase in viral load or a change in the presentation of viral antigens. How these changes occur is not known.</p><p>Most exacerbations are asymptomatic and are discovered during routine follow-up. However, some are accompanied by symptoms of acute hepatitis and may lead to the incorrect diagnosis of acute hepatitis B in patients who are not previously known to have chronic HBV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Exacerbations may be associated with an elevation in the IgM anti-HBc titer, which may lead to misdiagnosis of acute HBV infection and an increase in the serum alpha-fetoprotein concentration, which may raise concerns about the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/14,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,38</a>].</p><p>Exacerbations are more commonly observed in men than in women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. The reason for the gender difference is not clear, but a higher frequency of exacerbations in men may at least in part account for a higher incidence of HBV-related cirrhosis and HCC among men.</p><p>In a small percentage of patients, exacerbations result in hepatic decompensation and rarely death from hepatic failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. One report found that a serum HBV DNA level of 1.55 x 10<sup>9</sup> <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> (approximately 8 log<sub>10</sub> international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL)</span> or greater at the onset of a flare predicted decompensation in HBeAg positive patients without cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Patients with severe exacerbations should be referred to specialized centers for liver transplantation and receive treatment with nucleos(t)ide analogues. Interferon is not indicated in this setting since it can cause further exacerbation of the disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-virus-overview-of-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis B virus: Overview of management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Not all exacerbations lead to HBeAg seroconversion and clearance of HBV DNA from the serum, a phenomenon termed <strong>abortive</strong> immune clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/14,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,34</a>]. These patients may develop recurrent exacerbations with an intermittent disappearance of serum HBV DNA with or without a transient loss of HBeAg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F76907\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76907 \">figure 2</a>). Such repeated episodes of hepatitis may increase the risk of developing cirrhosis and HCC.

There is no clear evidence that alcoholics have an enhanced risk of chronic HBV infection. However, HBV DNA has been detected in the sera and liver tissues in some HBsAg negative alcoholics who present with liver disease, implying that occult HBV infection may have contributed to liver disease in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/98,99\" class=\"abstract_t\">98,99</a>].</p><p>Alcoholics with HBV infection have been reported to have accelerated liver injury, increased risk of developing cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and reduced survival compared with alcoholics who are not HBV-infected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/100-103\" class=\"abstract_t\">100-103</a>]. As an example, the odds of having HCC appear to be much higher in patients with heavy alcohol use compared with those who use less alcohol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. Obesity also increases the risk of HCC among patients who drink alcohol on a regular basis (ie, at least four drinks per week for at least one year) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>].

These findings suggest that HCV coinfection may interfere with the replication of HBV, leading to attenuation of liver damage. However, acute coinfection of HCV and HBV, or acute HCV on preexisting chronic HBV have also been reported to increase the risk of severe hepatitis and fulminant hepatic failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/106-108\" class=\"abstract_t\">106-108</a>]. Similarly, acute HBV in patients with chronic HCV can lead to severe hepatitis, but may also lead to clearance of HCV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>].</p><p>Approximately 10 to 15 percent of patients with HBV-associated chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have coexistent HCV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. In a study of 1257 patients with chronic HCV infection, 62 percent had evidence of exposure to HBV, while 6 percent had concurrent chronic HBV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]. The risk of developing HCC appears to be greater among those with dual-infection compared with those who are infected with HBV or HCV alone. As an example, the effect of HBV and HCV infection on the development of HCC was evaluated in a study of 23,830 individuals from Taiwan, of whom 477 developed HCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>]. The incidence of HCC in men and women who were dually-infected (ie, positive for hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] and antibodies against HCV [anti-HCV]) was 38 and 27 percent, respectively, whereas the incidence of HCC for men and women who were only positive for HBsAg was 27 and 8 percent, respectively.</p><p>HCV superinfection in HBsAg carriers appears to reduce HBV DNA levels in serum and liver tissues and to increase the rate of HBsAg seroconversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/113-117\" class=\"abstract_t\">113-117</a>]. Most patients who have dual HCV and HBV infections have detectable serum HCV RNA but undetectable or low HBV DNA levels, indicating that HCV is the predominant cause of liver disease in these patients. On the other hand, levels of HBV DNA and HCV RNA fluctuate over time in about one-third of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>]. Liver disease is usually more severe than in patients infected by HBV alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/119\" class=\"abstract_t\">119</a>]. Patients with dual HBV and HCV infection may also have a higher rate of HCC compared with patients infected by either virus alone, particularly those who are anti-HCV and HBeAg positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/117,120,121\" class=\"abstract_t\">117,120,121</a>].</p><p>The treatment of HCV infection with peginterferon plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a> or direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA) in patients with concomitant HBV infection can lead to a sustained virologic response. The rate of sustained virologic response is similar to that observed in patients with HCV alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. However, HBV replication may increase after clearance of HCV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/93,122\" class=\"abstract_t\">93,122</a>]. Thus, close monitoring of both viruses is required, and testing of HBsAg and anti-HBc should be done prior to initiating DAA therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>].

This recommendation is based upon theoretical grounds (that patients with chronic liver disease might have a worse prognosis if they developed superimposed acute hepatitis) rather than firm data, particularly with respect to HBV. In one study, in which 163 patients with chronic hepatitis B were prospectively followed for seven years, hepatitis A superinfection occurred in 10 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatitis-b-virus-clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history/abstract/131\" class=\"abstract_t\">131</a>]. An uncomplicated course occurred in nine of these patients; one patient who also had preexisting cirrhosis developed marked cholestasis. The outcome was much worse in patients with chronic HCV.

During the acute phase, manifestations range from subclinical or anicteric hepatitis to icteric hepatitis and, in some cases, fulminant hepatitis; during the chronic phase, manifestations range from an asymptomatic carrier state to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Extrahepatic manifestations also can occur with both acute and chronic infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 70 percent of patients with acute hepatitis B have subclinical or anicteric hepatitis, while 30 percent develop icteric hepatitis. The disease may be more severe in patients coinfected with other hepatitis viruses or with underlying liver disease. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Acute hepatitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with acute hepatitis B, we suggest treatment with a nucleos(t)ide analogue in those who have severe hepatitis (such as those who develop a coagulopathy [INR &gt;1.5]) or a protracted course (such as persistent symptoms or marked jaundice [bilirubin &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL]</span> for more than four weeks after presentation) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We also suggest treating patients with fulminant hepatitis B to reduce the likelihood of reinfection post-liver transplant, those who are immunocompromised, have concomitant infection with hepatitis C or D virus, have preexisting liver disease, or are elderly. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Acute hepatitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The natural course of chronic hepatitis B virus infection is determined by the interplay between virus replication and the host immune response. Chronic HBV infection generally consists of two phases: an early replicative phase with active liver disease, and a late or low replicative phase with remission of liver disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F67609\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67609 \">figure 1</a>). In patients with perinatally acquired HBV infection, there is an additional immune tolerance phase in which virus replication is not accompanied by active liver disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F76907\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76907 \">figure 2</a>). In some patients, reactivation of HBV replication occurs after a varying period of quiescence. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Phases of chronic HBV infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The sequelae of chronic HBV infection vary from an inactive carrier state to the development of cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), extrahepatic manifestations, and death. The prognosis appears to vary with the clinical setting.
