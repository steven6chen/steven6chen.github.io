As an example, intracranial hemorrhage can be caused by intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH, also called parenchymal hemorrhage), which involves bleeding directly into brain tissue, and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), which involves bleeding into the cerebrospinal fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-classification-and-epidemiology-of-stroke/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the classification of stroke. The clinical diagnosis of stroke subtypes and an overview of stroke evaluation are discussed separately.

Approximately 80 percent of strokes are due to ischemic cerebral infarction and 20 percent to brain hemorrhage.</p><p>An infarcted brain is pale initially. Within hours to days, the gray matter becomes congested with engorged, dilated blood vessels and minute petechial hemorrhages. When an embolus blocking a major vessel migrates, lyses, or disperses within minutes to days, recirculation into the infarcted area can cause a hemorrhagic infarction and may aggravate edema formation due to disruption of the blood-brain barrier.</p><p>A primary ICH damages the brain directly at the site of the hemorrhage by compressing the surrounding tissue. Physicians must initially consider whether the patient with suspected cerebrovascular disease is experiencing symptoms and signs suggestive of ischemia or hemorrhage.</p><p>The great majority of ischemic strokes are caused by a diminished supply of arterial blood, which carries sugar and oxygen to brain tissue. Another cause of stroke that is difficult to classify is stroke due to occlusion of veins that drain the brain of blood. Venous occlusion causes a back-up of fluid resulting in brain edema, and in addition it may cause both brain ischemia and hemorrhage into the brain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">BRAIN ISCHEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are three main subtypes of brain ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-classification-and-epidemiology-of-stroke/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thrombosis (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Thrombosis'</a> below) generally refers to local in situ obstruction of an artery. The obstruction may be due to disease of the arterial wall, such as arteriosclerosis, dissection, or fibromuscular dysplasia; there may or may not be superimposed thrombosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Embolism (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Embolism'</a> below) refers to particles of debris originating elsewhere that block arterial access to a particular brain region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-classification-and-epidemiology-of-stroke/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Since the process is not local (as with thrombosis), local therapy only temporarily solves the problem; further events may occur if the source of embolism is not identified and treated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic hypoperfusion (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Systemic hypoperfusion'</a> below) is a more general circulatory problem, manifesting itself in the brain and perhaps other organs.</p><p/><p>Blood disorders (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Blood disorders'</a> below) are an uncommon primary cause of stroke. However, increased blood coagulability can result in thrombus formation and subsequent cerebral embolism in the presence of an endothelial lesion located in the heart, aorta, or large arteries that supply the brain.</p><p>Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is defined clinically by the temporary nature of the associated neurologic symptoms, which last less than 24 hours by the classic definition. The definition is changing with recognition that transient neurologic symptoms are frequently associated with permanent brain tissue injury. The definition of TIA is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-etiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-transient-ischemic-attack#H2074998073\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, etiology, and clinical manifestations of transient ischemic attack&quot;, section on 'Definition of TIA'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Thrombosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thrombotic strokes are those in which the pathologic process giving rise to thrombus formation in an artery produces a stroke either by reduced blood flow distally (low flow) or by an embolic fragment that breaks off and travels to a more distant vessel (artery-to-artery embolism). Thrombotic strokes can be divided into either large or small vessel disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F55099\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55099 \">table 1</a>). These two subtypes of thrombosis are worth distinguishing since the causes, outcomes, and treatments are different.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Large vessel disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Large vessels include both the extracranial (common and internal carotids, vertebral) and intracranial arterial system (Circle of Willis and proximal branches) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F51410\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51410 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F65199\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65199 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>Intrinsic lesions in large extracranial and intracranial arteries cause symptoms by reducing blood flow beyond obstructive lesions, and by serving as the source of intra-arterial emboli. At times a combination of mechanisms is operant. Severe stenosis promotes the formation of thrombi which can break off and embolize, and the reduced blood flow caused by the vascular obstruction makes the circulation less competent at washing out and clearing these emboli.</p><p>Pathologies affecting large extracranial vessels include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atherosclerosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dissection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Takayasu arteritis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Giant cell arteritis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fibromuscular dysplasia</p><p/><p>Pathologies affecting large intracranial vessels include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atherosclerosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dissection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Arteritis/vasculitis</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Noninflammatory vasculopathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moyamoya syndrome</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vasoconstriction</p><p/><p>Atherosclerosis is by far the most common cause of in situ local disease within the large extracranial and intracranial arteries that supply the brain. White platelet-fibrin and red erythrocyte-fibrin thrombi are often superimposed upon the atherosclerotic lesions, or they may develop without severe vascular disease in patients with hypercoagulable states. Vasoconstriction (eg, with migraine) is probably the next most common, followed in frequency by arterial dissection (a disorder much more common than previously recognized) and traumatic occlusion. Fibromuscular dysplasia is an uncommon arteriopathy, while arteritis is frequently mentioned in the differential diagnosis, but it is an extremely rare cause of thrombotic stroke.</p><p>Aortic disease is really a form of proximal extracranial large vessel disease, but it is often considered together with cardioembolic sources because of anatomic proximity. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Aortic atherosclerosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Identification of the specific focal vascular lesion, including its nature, severity, and localization, is important for treatment since local therapy may be effective (eg, surgery, angioplasty, intraarterial thrombolysis). It should be possible clinically in most patients to determine whether the local vascular disease is within the anterior (carotid) or posterior (vertebrobasilar) circulation and whether the disorder affects large or penetrating arteries. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-diagnosis-of-stroke-subtypes#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical diagnosis of stroke subtypes&quot;, section on 'Neurologic examination'</a>.)</p><p>Delivery of adequate blood through a blocked or partially blocked artery depends upon many factors, including blood pressure, blood viscosity, and collateral flow. Local vascular lesions also may throw off emboli, which can cause transient symptoms. In patients with thrombosis, the neurologic symptoms often fluctuate, remit, or progress in a stuttering fashion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F64107\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64107 \">figure 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-diagnosis-of-stroke-subtypes#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical diagnosis of stroke subtypes&quot;, section on 'Clinical course'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-etiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-transient-ischemic-attack#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, etiology, and clinical manifestations of transient ischemic attack&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations and mechanisms'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Small vessel disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Small vessel disease affects the intracerebral arterial system, specifically penetrating arteries that arise from the distal vertebral artery, the basilar artery, the middle cerebral artery stem, and the arteries of the circle of Willis. These arteries thrombose due to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lipohyalinosis (a lipid hyaline build-up distally secondary to hypertension) and fibrinoid degeneration</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atheroma formation at their origin or in the parent large artery</p><p/><p>The most common cause of obstruction of the smaller arteries and arterioles that penetrate at right angles to supply the deeper structures within the brain (eg, basal ganglia, internal capsule, thalamus, pons) is lipohyalinosis (ie, blockage of an artery by medial hypertrophy and lipid admixed with fibrinoid material in the hypertrophied arterial wall). A stroke due to obstruction of these vessels is referred to as a lacunar stroke. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lacunar-infarcts\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lacunar infarcts&quot;</a>.) Lipohyalinosis is most often related to hypertension, but aging may play a role.</p><p>Microatheromas can also block these small penetrating arteries, as can plaques within the larger arteries that block or extend into the orifices of the branches (called atheromatous branch disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-classification-and-epidemiology-of-stroke/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Penetrating artery occlusions usually cause symptoms that develop during a short period of time, hours or at most a few days (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F52246\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52246 \">figure 4</a>), compared with large artery-related brain ischemia, which can evolve over a longer period.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Embolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Embolic strokes are divided into four categories (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F55099\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55099 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those with a known source that is cardiac</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those with a possible cardiac or aortic source based upon transthoracic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> transesophageal echocardiographic findings</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those with an arterial source (artery to artery embolism)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those with a truly unknown source in which tests for embolic sources are negative</p><p/><p>The symptoms depend upon the region of brain rendered ischemic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-classification-and-epidemiology-of-stroke/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The embolus suddenly blocks the recipient site so that the onset of symptoms is abrupt and usually maximal at the start (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F73261\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73261 \">figure 5</a>). Unlike thrombosis, multiple sites within different vascular territories may be affected when the source is the heart (eg, left atrial appendage or left ventricular thrombus) or aorta. Treatment will depend upon the source and composition of the embolus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-prevention-for-specific-causes-of-ischemic-stroke-and-transient-ischemic-attack\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary prevention for specific causes of ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Cardioembolic strokes usually occur abruptly, although they occasionally present with stuttering, fluctuating symptoms. The symptoms may clear entirely since emboli can migrate and lyse, particularly those composed of thrombus. When this occurs, infarction generally also occurs but is silent; the area of infarction is smaller than the area of ischemia that gave rise to the symptoms. This process is often referred to as a TIA due to embolism, although it is more correctly termed an embolic infarction or stroke in which the symptoms clear within 24 hours.</p><p>Cardioembolic strokes can be divided into those with a known source and those with a possible cardiac or ascending aortic source based upon transthoracic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> transesophageal echocardiographic findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-classification-and-epidemiology-of-stroke/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">High-risk cardiac source</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of embolic strokes with a known cardiac source is generally agreed upon by physicians (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F60843\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60843 \">table 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-classification-and-epidemiology-of-stroke/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]; included in this category are those due to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrial fibrillation and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rheumatic mitral or aortic valve disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bioprosthetic and mechanical heart valves</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrial or ventricular thrombus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sick sinus syndrome</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sustained atrial flutter</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recent myocardial infarction (within one month)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic myocardial infarction together with ejection fraction &lt;28 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptomatic congestive heart failure with ejection fraction &lt;30 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dilated cardiomyopathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fibrous nonbacterial endocarditis as found in patients with systemic lupus (ie, Libman-Sacks endocarditis), antiphospholipid syndrome, and cancer (marantic endocarditis)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infective endocarditis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Papillary fibroelastoma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Left atrial myxoma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery</p><p/><p>With CABG, for example, the incidence of postoperative neurologic sequelae is approximately 2 to 6 percent, most of which is due to stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-classification-and-epidemiology-of-stroke/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Thus, they are considered potential sources of embolism.

However, most studies evaluating secondary stroke risk have found that complex aortic atherosclerosis is a risk factor for recurrent stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-classification-and-epidemiology-of-stroke/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>].</p><p>The range of findings is illustrated by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective case-control study examined the frequency and thickness of atherosclerotic plaques in the ascending aorta and proximal arch in 250 patients admitted to the hospital with ischemic stroke and 250 consecutive controls, all over the age of 60 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-classification-and-epidemiology-of-stroke/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Atherosclerotic plaques &ge;4 mm in thickness were found in 14 percent of patients compared with 2 percent of controls, and the odds ratio for ischemic stroke among patients with such plaques was 9.1 after adjustment for atherosclerotic risk factors.

Most affected patients have other evidence of circulatory compromise and hypotension such as pallor, sweating, tachycardia or severe bradycardia, and low blood pressure. The neurologic signs are typically bilateral, although they may be asymmetric when there is preexisting asymmetrical craniocerebral vascular occlusive disease.</p><p>The most severe ischemia may occur in border zone (watershed) regions between the major cerebral supply arteries since these areas are most vulnerable to systemic hypoperfusion. The signs that may occur with borderzone infarction include cortical blindness, or at least bilateral visual loss; stupor; and weakness of the shoulders and thighs with sparing of the face, hands, and feet (a pattern likened to a &quot;man-in-a-barrel&quot;).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood and coagulation disorders are an uncommon primary cause of stroke and TIA, but they should be considered in patients younger than age 45, patients with a history of clotting dysfunction, and in patients with a history of cryptogenic stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-classification-and-epidemiology-of-stroke/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

It assigns ischemic strokes to five subtypes based upon clinical features and the results of ancillary studies including brain imaging, neurovascular evaluations, cardiac tests, and laboratory evaluations for a prothrombotic state.</p><p>The five TOAST subtypes of ischemic stroke are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large artery atherosclerosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardioembolism</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small vessel occlusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stroke of other determined etiology</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stroke of undetermined etiology</p><p/><p>The last subtype, stroke of undetermined etiology, involves cases where the cause of a stroke cannot be determined with any degree of confidence, and by definition includes those with two or more potential causes identified, those with a negative evaluation, and those with an incomplete evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cryptogenic-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cryptogenic stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H60049534\"><span class=\"h2\">SSS-TOAST and CCS classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since the original TOAST classification scheme was developed in the early 1990s, advances in stroke evaluation and diagnostic imaging have allowed more frequent identification of potential vascular and cardiac causes of stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-classification-and-epidemiology-of-stroke/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These advances could cause an increasing proportion of ischemic strokes to be classified as &quot;undetermined&quot; if the strict definition of this category (cases with two or more potential causes) is applied.</p><p>As a result, an evidenced-based modification of the TOAST criteria called SSS-TOAST was developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-classification-and-epidemiology-of-stroke/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The SSS-TOAST system divides each of the original TOAST subtypes into three subcategories as &quot;evident,&quot; &quot;probable,&quot; or &quot;possible&quot; based upon the weight of diagnostic evidence as determined by predefined clinical and imaging criteria. In a further refinement, an automated version of the SSS-TOAST called the Causative Classification System (CCS) was devised (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F57732\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57732 \">table 4</a>) to improve its usefulness and accuracy for stroke subtyping [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-classification-and-epidemiology-of-stroke/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The CCS is a computerized algorithm that consists of questionnaire-style classification scheme. The CCS appears to have good inter-rater reliability among multiple centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-classification-and-epidemiology-of-stroke/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. It is available online at <a href=\"https://ccs.mgh.harvard.edu/ccs_title.php&amp;token=BXaJvGeTd5o3h6FPUDTovuj5feWMueiBXAUW7O1XDtRN6Ne4SodvRBB5/YJmXp9c&amp;TOPIC_ID=1089\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">https://ccs.mgh.harvard.edu/ccs_title.php</a>.</p><p>The overall agreement between the original TOAST and CCS classification systems appears to be moderate at best, suggesting that two methods often classify stroke cases into different categories despite having categories with similar names [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-classification-and-epidemiology-of-stroke/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">BRAIN HEMORRHAGE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two main subtypes of brain hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-classification-and-epidemiology-of-stroke/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) refers to bleeding directly into the brain parenchyma</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) refers to bleeding into the cerebrospinal fluid within the subarachnoid space that surrounds the brain</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Intracerebral hemorrhage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bleeding in ICH is usually derived from arterioles or small arteries. The bleeding is directly into the brain, forming a localized hematoma that spreads along white matter pathways. Accumulation of blood occurs over minutes or hours; the hematoma gradually enlarges by adding blood at its periphery like a snowball rolling downhill. The hematoma continues to grow until the pressure surrounding it increases enough to limit its spread or until the hemorrhage decompresses itself by emptying into the ventricular system or into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on the pial surface of the brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-classification-and-epidemiology-of-stroke/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p>The most common causes of ICH are hypertension, trauma, bleeding diatheses, amyloid angiopathy, illicit drug use (mostly amphetamines and cocaine), and vascular malformations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-classification-and-epidemiology-of-stroke/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.) Less frequent causes include bleeding into tumors, aneurysmal rupture, and vasculitis.</p><p>The earliest symptoms of ICH relate to dysfunction of the portion of the brain that contains the hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-classification-and-epidemiology-of-stroke/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding into the right putamen and internal capsule region causes left limb motor <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sensory signs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding into the cerebellum causes difficulty walking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding into the left temporal lobe presents as aphasia</p><p/><p>The neurologic symptoms usually increase gradually over minutes or a few hours. In contrast to brain embolism and SAH, the neurologic symptoms related to ICH may not begin abruptly and are not maximal at onset (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F61491\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61491 \">figure 6</a>) (and see below).</p><p>Headache, vomiting, and a decreased level of consciousness develop if the hematoma becomes large enough to increase intracranial pressure or cause shifts in intracranial contents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F60831\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60831 \">figure 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-classification-and-epidemiology-of-stroke/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. These symptoms are absent with small hemorrhages; the clinical presentation in this setting is that of a gradually progressing stroke.</p><p>ICH destroys brain tissue as it enlarges. The pressure created by blood and surrounding brain edema is life-threatening; large hematomas have a high mortality and morbidity. The goal of treatment is to contain and limit the bleeding. Recurrences are unusual if the causative disorder is controlled (eg, hypertension or bleeding diathesis).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Subarachnoid hemorrhage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two major causes of SAH are rupture of arterial aneurysms that lie at the base of the brain and bleeding from vascular malformations that lie near the pial surface. Bleeding diatheses, trauma, amyloid angiopathy, and illicit drug use are less common. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Rupture of an aneurysm releases blood directly into the CSF under arterial pressure. The blood spreads quickly within the CSF, rapidly increasing intracranial pressure. Death or deep coma ensues if the bleeding continues. The bleeding usually lasts only a few seconds but rebleeding is very common. With causes of SAH other than aneurysm rupture, the bleeding is less abrupt and may continue over a longer period of time.</p><p>Symptoms of SAH begin abruptly in contrast to the more gradual onset of ICH. The sudden increase in pressure causes a cessation of activity (eg, loss of memory or focus or knees buckling). Headache is an invariable symptom and is typically instantly severe and widespread; the pain may radiate into the neck or even down the back into the legs. Vomiting occurs soon after onset. There are usually no important focal neurologic signs unless bleeding occurs into the brain and CSF at the same time (meningocerebral hemorrhage). Onset headache is more common than in ICH, and the combination of onset headache and vomiting is infrequent in ischemic stroke (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F60831\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60831 \">figure 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-classification-and-epidemiology-of-stroke/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Approximately 30 percent of patients have a minor hemorrhage manifested only by sudden and severe headache (the so-called sentinel headache) that precedes a major SAH (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F60831\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60831 \">figure 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-classification-and-epidemiology-of-stroke/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The complaint of the sudden onset of severe headache is sufficiently characteristic that SAH should always be considered. In a prospective study of 148 patients presenting with sudden and severe headache, for example, SAH was present in 25 percent overall and 12 percent in patients in whom headache was the only symptom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-classification-and-epidemiology-of-stroke/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>The goal of treatment of SAH is to identify the cause and quickly treat it to prevent rebleeding. The other goal of treatment is to prevent brain damage due to delayed ischemia related to vasoconstriction of intracranial arteries; blood within the CSF induces vasoconstriction, which can be intense and severe. The treatment of SAH is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7719405\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Globally, the incidence of stroke due to ischemia is 68 percent, while the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke (intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage combined) is 32 percent, reflecting a higher incidence of hemorrhagic stroke in low- and middle-income countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-classification-and-epidemiology-of-stroke/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].
